Indeed, local and regional tensions between Catholics and Protestants continue, notably in Ireland and the United States. Elsewhere Protestant-Catholic conflict declined&amp;nbsp;- or more positively, was resolved. The implications of this process for understanding and addressing other contemporary conflicts in which religion is implicated will be explored. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The following specific tasks will be undertaken: &lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Comparative analysis of anti-Catholic movements in the English-speaking world;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Research on the role of religion in local sectarian conflict, in English cities and in Northern Ireland;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>A PhD thesis examining British perceptions of Roman Catholicism and national security between the mid-nineteenth and the mid-twentieth centuries;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>A symposium and collaborative book publication by a team of experts, providing an overview of Protestant-Catholic conflict since the Reformation;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>The compilation of an annotated on-line bibliography of relevant literature;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>A sole-authored book providing a synthesis of the work done, and exploring its implications for contemporary security concerns. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The programme will culminate in 2012 with a series of seminars and a concluding conference in Belfast for both academic and non-academic stakeholders.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>349007</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Thoughtcrimes and the control of 'subversive' views: Historical and contemporary perspectives  (Exeter)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A8ECDDC-4942-4938-85DB-528C8875A4FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This small workshop was held in collaboration with a fellow Global Uncertainties Leadership Fellow, Prof Robert Gleave of the University of Exeter.

It has thus drawn out fluctuations and contingencies. The overall broad conclusion has been to show that there is no inevitability that religious DIFFERENCE will lead to religious CONFLICT, and more specifically to pinpoint the historical specificities that destabilise situations of more or less peaceful co-existence. 



More particular insights include:

? The close parallels between anti-Catholicism and Islamophobia and hence the value of analysing both complex sets of attitudes alongside each other in the endeavour better to understand underlying Western attitudes to perceived 'dangerous' religion; 

? That secularization should not be seen as a 'solution' to religious conflict, as religious categories can persist - notably in Northern Ireland - even when religious practice declines. Loss of religious literacy and a reduction in the authority of religious leaders diminish the effectiveness of religion-led peacebuilding; 

? That a simplistic view of history - of straightforward 'wars of religion' in the distant past, of their subsequent disappearance, and recent resurgence - can be dangerously misleading insofar as it influences contemporary thinking and action;

? The importance of balancing concerns for 'hard' physical security with a proper understanding of the factors conducive to 'soft' cultural security, of which religion is an important part.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Key implications for different categories of users are as follows: 

? Policy makers need to consider the ways in which well-intentioned strategies to promote equality and diversity may have unintended consequences in reifying religious categories and divisions that are more subtle and fluid on the ground. This is a particular issue in past-Good Friday Agreement Northern Ireland. 

? Religious leaders need to be aware of the perception that they have 'failed' in the past, and to be conscious of their potential to shape the future by more effective engagement with their own nominal communities to resist radical extremism on the one hand and the decline of religion into social irrelevance on the other. 

? The media and educators can help to address religious conflict situations by encouraging religious and historical literacy rather than simplistic stereotyping. The upcoming 'decade of anniversaries' in Ireland, and the centenary of the First World War everywhere will offer particular challenges and opportunities in this respect.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5206EE15-3D72-4EEC-965A-19214FCA87ED</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2157911241.2016015b2f163ca</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government/ Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6C411E03-F5CD-49BE-B3E2-FA7F2F0C4676</gtr:id><gtr:title>Religion as an Agent of Change</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b35f176c3872e51aa3d96cb61eab67f1"><gtr:id>b35f176c3872e51aa3d96cb61eab67f1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolffe J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d94de6e9e908.53739062</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>895FF5D1-8181-4439-961E-9662A7C6CF40</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protestant-Catholic Divisions in Europe and the United States: An Historical and Comparative Perspective</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Politics, Religion &amp;
