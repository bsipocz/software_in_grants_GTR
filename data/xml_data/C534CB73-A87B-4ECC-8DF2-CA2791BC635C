Such developments will have the potential to impact directly on major societal issues; Energy, Green Chemistry and Health.

Our everyday lives are heavily reliant on hi-tech organic materials, whether these be for our day-to-day technological needs such as organic light emitting diodes (e.g. in mobile phone displays) and organic field effect transistors, or for next-generation designer drugs to treat cancer or other chronic illnesses. With the continuing emergence of Developing Countries seeking both improved healthcare and technology, global demand for such specialty materials is likely to rise exponentially, thus increasing the pressure to identify and utilise energy efficient production methods. At the same time, increasing energy costs have led us to face the new reality of a potential deterioration in our current standard of living as the price of consumer goods continues to rise. In order to combat such issues, alternative energy sources must be identified and new energy/cost-efficient methods must be sought to meet global demand while minimising the environmental impact.

Relating to this, catalysts assist in converting cheaper bulk chemicals to higher value products via lower energy pathways whilst themselves remaining unchanged at the end of the reaction. However, many catalysts are based on rare and expensive 'precious metals' (e.g. Pd, Pt, Ir) whose supply is limited. The successful development of alternative catalysts is one of the largest global challenges for the next decade and is a highly attractive field of research. Recently, there has been a renaissance in 'main group' chemistry for the generation of alternative systems for catalysis. This has the potential to serve as a lower cost, environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to traditional metal-catalysed industrial processes. This program aims to exploit the reactivity of boron in catalytic hydrogenation reactions, one of the most useful reactions in academia and industry that is currently dominated by precious metal catalysts. Such reactions are highly important to the global economy and to sustainable chemistry.

In addition, boron containing molecules have been shown to have profound applications in organic synthesis and in the manufacture and production of fine chemicals (pharmaceuticals), organic electronics, agrochemicals inter alia. The use of organoboranes has had a huge impact on the molecular assembly of new compounds such as in the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds (cross-coupling reactions), and led to Akira Suzuki sharing the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for &amp;quot;palladium-catalysed cross couplings in organic synthesis&amp;quot;. Yet new, clean and energy/atom-efficient methods to create organoboranes for applications in bond forming reactions are still desirable. The boron compounds developed in this proposal will also be tested in synthetic transformations to develop innovative routes to access organoboron reagents and complex organic compounds in a single step.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The development of main group chemistry towards new sustainable approaches to fine chemicals that are both energy/atom-efficient as well as high yielding is of high practical importance. Such changes will bring about significant economic and societal impact in the short, medium and long term: 

In the short term, the knowledge acquired in this program will have a direct impact on other academics working in the field of main group promoted transformations and/or catalysis through providing improved academic insight into trends in chemical reactivity. In addition, the chemical transformations developed within these studies will be of use to researchers in the field of organic synthesis who will directly benefit from these innovative alternative one-pot syntheses of complex organic structures. Moreover, EPSRC support for this program will provide direct training of a high calibre PDRA as well as a PhD student (financed by Cardiff University as part of their commitment to this research program) who will contribute to the pool of highly-trained scientific personnel for academic and industrial research positions. Both the PI and Cardiff University are fully committed to the training of highly qualified personnel (HQP). These HQP will develop multidisciplinary skill sets in synthesis, air-sensitive chemistry, modern spectroscopic analysis, quantum mechanics, and X-ray crystal structure solution/refinement. The technological training combined with hands-on access to sophisticated state-of-the-art instrumentation, coupled with the opportunity to interact with a range of world-leading academics will provide a unique environment that will provide the HQP with an internationally competitive background in synthetic and catalytic methodology, making them highly attractive in an increasingly competitive job market. 

In the medium term, as the scope of the chemical transformations and catalytic reactions described in this proposal becomes more clearly established and recognised, the results will have a direct impact on those working in synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry. This will lead to changes in synthetic methodology at both academic and industrial research levels, paving the way towards energy savings and reduced chemical waste. Research that contributes to lower economic and environmental costs, and efficient development of high value materials through novel (catalytic) bond forming processes will be of interest to the multi-billion pound per annum pharmaceutical or agrochemical industries and will have obvious benefits to the UK. The success of this project will therefore further consolidate the PI as an internationally leading researcher in main group chemistry, thereby raising the profile of UK academic research. Moreover success in this field will provide the opportunity for the PI to strengthen collaborations with industrial partners (e.g. through CASE awards) in the medium term. In this context, it is noteworthy that Pfizer have already expressed interest in this area of research and are currently funding a short-term project with the PI.

In the long term, as these catalytic reactions and synthetic methodologies become accepted, their transfer to industrial applications in, for example, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, may be expected to have a significant impact on a range of economic and societal issues including quality of life, health and the environment, which are all key metrics in the Research Excellence Framework. Cardiff University actively supports innovation. Methodological or technological developments obtained from this research will be handled through the University Technology Transfer Group, which is dedicated to the transfer, application and exploitation of knowledge beyond the confines of academia. The project will be assessed during each phase and important innovations which offer the potential for future industrial exploitation will be appropriately protected through patent.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99531</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Societal Impact has been achieved achieved via the two-way communication of the project objectives and outputs between academia and society though presenting the results of these studies into sustainable, metal-free catalytic processes effectively to a general audience.

Each of these research articles describes they synthesis and reactivity of Lewis acidic boron compounds. In some cases we have shown how these boron reagents can either (i) mimic established precious metal (Au) mediated reactions or (ii) how Lewis acidic boranes can lead to novel and unique reactivity. Boron compounds and catalysts have a special place in synthetic chemistry for the development of organic compounds which may have applications in the pharmaceutical setting.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research outputs from this project have helped to provide a fresh insight into the area of synthetic boron chemistry and metal-free catalysis. Indeed, the UK currently has strengths in this area which place it at a competitive advantage and the outcomes from this project could be readily exploited by a variety of academics in their own studies:

- The highly Lewis acidic boranes and borocations developed will be of direct interest to those working in the emerging field of main group mediated transformations and catalytic processes such as Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) chemistry. 

- Comparative reactivity trends and catalytic activity of these boron compounds with their transition metal counterparts will be of particular interest to those working in the much larger field of transition metal catalysis.

- The organoboron intermediates and organic products generated in this project will be key to end-users in the field of organic synthesis for the production of fine chemicals and materials products.

- In the long term, the synthetic products e.g. biologically active pharmaceuticals or molecular electronics will be of significance to those involved in healthcare or materials science.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9ABD8F90-9696-4D99-9058-4E903977265E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bc1434aff945.33563064</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7DCA28B5-7EA6-4863-ADE2-86D2590C028E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane and Beyond: Modern Advances in Borylation Chemistry.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Inorganic chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d728abbffb673cd41817dbe8ce671635"><gtr:id>d728abbffb673cd41817dbe8ce671635</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawson JR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0020-1669</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a352ca09e2109.80784049</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>42881498-354C-456A-9ADC-41E652C3E060</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Propargyl Rearrangement to Functionalised Allyl-Boron and Borocation Compounds.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/526af72bc105b3f8c67d7f7bf4474cb2"><gtr:id>526af72bc105b3f8c67d7f7bf4474cb2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilkins LC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0947-6539</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d5bec19fec2.59382011</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E5DBD8C2-018B-49CB-A1E9-818D03F6827A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Synthesis and reactivity of N,N'-1,4-diazabutadiene derived borocations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d728abbffb673cd41817dbe8ce671635"><gtr:id>d728abbffb673cd41817dbe8ce671635</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawson JR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1477-9226</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d7f592e0b39.00058299</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C74B40E3-CC8B-4884-90B5-77AB3A59E776</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contrasting Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity with Selenium- and Boron-Based Lewis Acids.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/526af72bc105b3f8c67d7f7bf4474cb2"><gtr:id>526af72bc105b3f8c67d7f7bf4474cb2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilkins LC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1433-7851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d5adda3a2e7.21769916</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CCDEAB52-DEF4-4459-8CFB-590A794C4D3B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tris(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)borane: An Efficient Hydroboration Catalyst.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d728abbffb673cd41817dbe8ce671635"><gtr:id>d728abbffb673cd41817dbe8ce671635</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawson JR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0947-6539</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fe3e9636503.24710027</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N02320X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
