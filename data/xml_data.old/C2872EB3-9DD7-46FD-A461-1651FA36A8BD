Internet-of-Things: Opportunities for New Economic &amp;amp; Business Model</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K039911/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This research project aims to exploit the data available from a new generation of sensors and devices to develop new economic models. To do this we will carry out the following:

Firstly, we will build on existing research to develop a prototype home-hub that builds upon an extended domestic router capable of capturing a diverse collection of information into the home of 5 members of the project. Existing approaches to home automating have often proffered the use of home hubs as central points of control (e.g. Intel Home or Microsoft HomeOs) within their visions of a future home. However, we believe that the home hub is much more likely to arrive in the home setting in a piecemeal fashion. Consequently, we propose to adopt an evolutionary approach, to supplement the existing technologies in the home based on existing Digital Economy research in the Homework project. To supplement this quantitative data we will use ethnographic methods including technology tours, diary studies, experience sampling as well as a range of in-situ studies structured around unpacking the everday life for each artefact in the intranet of things.

Secondly, we will combine grounded theory and econometric techniques to analyse the data and build a series of theoretical models. Such models will be a simplification of the real world, but will supply testable predictions. We will analyse this data for patterns of use, an example illustrates the point. Consider the activity 'making tea'. This consists of a number of sub-activities including; putting the tea bag into the pot, filling the kettle, boiling the kettle, pouring water onto tea, allowing the tea to steep, deciding when the tea is strong enough, pouring tea into cup, adding milk, adding sugar etc. Sensors on the tea pot, kettle, milk jug, cup etc will provide quantitative data on for example, times of use, frequency of use, timings on use, proxies for distances travelled etc. Continuing with the analogy, the qualitative ethnographic data may provide context on when tea is made, who else is present, what other activities are co-incident etc. Together we will be able to develop a functional form of the activity 'making tea'. 

Thirdly, we will test the theoretical models using conjoint analysis. Conjoint analysis requires the user to make choices from a series of trade-offs which in turn identifies the relative importance and sensitivities of the variables and their relationship to some monetary value (price). Returning to our previous example, this will enable us to identify which of the activities are most important to the tea-making activity to make more or less tea or different teas, operationalising the latent need for more resources. Each cluster will be operationalised into an algorithm for development into a software app.

Fourthly, the algorithms will be developed into offerings which will then be placed on the H.A.T. to 'sell back' such offerings, simulating a market system using the Dropletpay payment platform. We will use the facilities of the International Institute of Product and Service Innovation (IIPSI) within WMG, to develop a 'H.A.T.'-fest. Here, developers, investors and SMEs will create new offerings based on the commodification of the personal data set ,applying the algorithms created to embed in their offerings, thereby creating a multi-sided market for new offerings to serve the home occupant, landlord or building manager as buyers of such offerings. The structure, conduct and performance of such offerings on the market platform will be then monitored to test its sustainability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The H.A.T. project aims to bring together industry and home owners/residents as sellers and buyers on a multi-sided market home information hub platform powered by the internet-of-things. The HAT would facilitate the purchase of new offerings to help with lived lives within the home in exchange for economic currency as well as digital personal data. This will be obtained through sensors and other digital capabilities integrated with connected things, as well as yet-to-be connected things. This approach would give an understanding of how future products and technologies should be designed to play a role in value creation, and how new offerings could serve contexts of lived lives better. 
The project contributes to academic impact in building research capacity in the domain of value, economic and business models. This is achieved by providing an approach to developing contextual archetypes at the point of usage of products and services and then generating new business and economic models. This research provides an unparalleled opportunity for business, sociology and economics researchers to conduct research in a live social contextual domain that will allow better insights through mixed methods and interdisciplinary activities, providing insights into actual behaviours, which have previously eluded researchers in the business domain. Academic impact on researchers would be achieved through publications, capacity building workshops and seminars through the NEMODE initiative, and realised within 2-3 years from the start of the project.
Industrial impact is achieved through the development of new UK technology businesses by identifying new opportunities available through the HAT. By creating a multi-sided market platform for the internet-of-things to generate new economic and business models, rather than merely a technology platform, businesses are created, existing industrial offerings can be made 'smart and social' which in turn will provide market leading offerings in this space. The project will also impact on UK manufacturers in helping them lead in the digital economy, manufacturing smart and connected things for global markets, creating horizontal business and economic models that integrate connectivity, content and social lives. The industrial impact also includes the creation of new offerings in the healthcare and wellbeing domain to enhance better quality of life that includes the role of the market. This impact is achieved in the last six months of the project when the platform has been deployed into 'the wild'. However, it is expected that the sustainability and impact would continue past the project duration as industry sees the viability of the propositions. 
Policy impact of this project lies in informing current policies on personal data privacy and legal issues. By creating a platform for 'digital labour', we show how markets could be created from incentivising more digital visibility in return for offerings to serve lived lives. The project also impacts on future digital economy research, informing initiatives that integrate social science and economics disciplines much closer to the challenges of Digital Economy and technology-driven research. This would be realised through workshops and briefings beginning from the second year of the project and expected to continue beyond the project lifetime.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>982377</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>HAT Industrial Advisory Board</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>99936DFA-CF47-4FD1-AD23-D40820EFDF57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The HAT Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) was set up to provide industry expertise to oversee the development and direction of the HAT project.

Subsequent Mad Hatters events were held in London on Nov 24, 2014 and April 17, 2015 to provide the targeted audience with updates of the project as well as to launch various HAT technologies and partnerships. Mad Hatter events were also held in Singapore on Feb 26, 2015 and the Silicon Valley in the USA on July 13, 2015 to introduce the HAT and discuss its economic model and eco-system to the audiences in those countries. In total, the events drew more than 200 participants and sparked many conversations about the HAT and the thinking about its technology and personal data and privacy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d869cef10641.35988352</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hubofallthings.com/join-the-hat-revolution/events-2-2/mad-hatters-tea-parties/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>485000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>RCUK Digital Economy Theme: Research in the Wild - Internet of Things 2013</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Research Councils UK (RCUK)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/L023911/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>093B7702-6115-40A7-A9AC-C1D1F3DC4243</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d47529187ca6.46762257</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Trust, Identity, Privacy &amp;amp; Security in the Digital Economy (Digital Economy TIPS)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/N028422/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>E7D3385B-71C9-4C06-9F27-34426553E385</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56debb5e1687e3.18212668</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>22000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>New Economic Models in the Digital Economy (NEMODE) call: Cryptocurrencies, the Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>9CF030EC-9171-4707-A20C-A7ECE77751D8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d856bb98f1e7.42490965</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research project's findings and development of the HAT is being taken forward by the HAT Foundation, a social enterprise grouping spun off from the HAT project. The HAT Foundation is led by a management team comprising academics and researchers who worked on the HAT project, including HAT Project PI Irene Ng and Paul Tasker, who was independent chair of the HAT Industrial Advisory Board. It consists of the HAT Community Foundation, a charity body and its operational arm HAT Data Exchange Ltd (HATDeX) which will further develop the Alpha HAT into its beta version of the HAT, to be rolled out to individual users globally in 2016. 
The ultimate aim is to make HATs ubiquitous, much like how we all have e-mail accounts, and therefore engineer a market for personal data. As a multi-sided platform for personal data, the HAT will help individuals realise that their personal data has value to those that collect it from all their actions on the Internet, including their interaction with the IoT. This will not only help individuals make better and more informed decisions in their lives, but also allow companies to offer them more personalised and customised offerings. 
The HAT project team has also collaborated with industry partners that will work with the HATDeX on the global roll-out of the HAT as HAT Platform Providers (HPPs). To date, the HAT has directly resulted in two start-ups; EnableiD in the UK and Noggin Pte Ltd in Singapore - both are to be HAT platform providers. Both businesses are working with their local authorities to bring personal data from multiple industry siloes together to render better personalised services to citizens. 
In line with this, the research on the HAT has also been used by EnableiD to develop a groundbreaking new technology called 'MyJrny'. The mobile app combines journey information with real-time transport network information to make better use of available transport network capacity, helping people avoid disruption and over-crowding. It also helps makes sense of people's personal data to help them save time, money and improve the overall travel experience whilst preserving their privacy.
The MyJrny mobile app has been developed with Centro, the public body responsible for West Midlands transport services and in association with Chiltern Railways and London Midland. Its pilot stage will see the app initially used in the UK, and will cover all modes of public transport as well as walking, cycling and driving, providing personalised travel advice before people set out as well as en-route. There are plans to launch the technology later this year in Singapore.

The HAT is a multi-sided platform that helps individuals gain control of their personal data. The HAT enables individuals to to collect, control, re-combine, contextualise and share this data in a privacy-preserving manner, with the right people, in the right situations, for the right purposes. This in itself has achieved the research project's original objective of creating a multi-sided market platform for connected services and products through a home information hub powered by the Internet-of-Things.

By the end of the project, an Alpha version of the HAT was released for testing by early adopters and the tech development community. The Alpha HAT platform consists of a database schema, a data logic layer and APIs within a trust framework that is known as the HAT personal data exchange ecosystem. A basic hyperdata browser (called RUMPEL) was also developed to be used with the HAT, to help individuals search and view their collections of personal data. RUMPEL was developed through a related research project - the EPSRC-funded Smart Me versus Smart Things: The Development of a Personal Resource Planning (PRP) System through Human Interactions with Data Enabled by the IoT.

All of the HAT technology has been made available as open source, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License. (More info here: http://hubofallthings.com/alpha-hat-is-here/)

The following is a list of what was developed and created (further details of each outcome has been reported in the Common Outcomes section):

HAT Briefing papers - 5 briefing papers that detail the design principles to engineer the HAT market ecosystem and its corresponding economic and business models
HAT Database Schema - to contain and structure your personal data
HAT APIs - to exercise user managed control of your personal dat
Data plugs - to claim your personal data
HyperData Browser - to view your data
Deployment mechanism - to provisioning the personal HAT. 
Documentation of technology developed</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The HAT briefing papers detail all the thinking that goes behind the design of the market and the ecosystem for personal data exchanges. Others may use the same principles to design platforms and markets and also to engineer new markets.
The HAT ontology and schema can be used free for others who work in the personal data space. Companies are free to build on the HAT and offer it commercially. They can also use the same ontology to hold personal data in their domains. The HAT is therefore a standard ontology for storing, flattening and exchanging personal data that can be offered by firms to their customers.
The research project's findings have built and put in place all that is necessary to create a multi-sided market for the trading and exchange of personal data. The Alpha version of the HAT and its technology has now been handed over to the HAT Foundation, a social enterprise spin-off tasked to roll-out the HAT to individual users globally and to revolutionise how individuals handle the vast amounts of personal data that we are pouring online. 
The findings and outputs of the HAT project has helped inform the RCUK-funded HARRIET project (Ref: EP/L023911/1), which has developed and released the basic hyperdata browser (called RUMPEL) on an open source basis. Other developers can contribute to its development and freely use it to create their own versions of the hyperdata browser. Through RUMPEL, which is also a personal resource planning tool for individuals, HARRIET will assist individuals to better understand their household consumption behaviour and make 'smarter' decisions to plan and live better lives based on their own data stored on the HAT. 
HAT research findings will also be the basis of the HAT Living Labs to be established through the &amp;pound;1.2m EPSRC grant (EP/N028422/1) for Control and Trust as Moderating Mechanisms in addressing Vulnerability for the Design of Business and Economic Models (ConTriVE). The HAT Living Labs (HALL) is a 'sandbox' within the HAT ecosystem with real users of HATs who have volunteered to be participate in an experimental environment where individuals and firms would exchange data and co-create innovations as well as test out business and economic models of data exchanges.
The personal data exchange ecosystem developed through the HAT project will form the basis of the ReadiPeDeX project funded by the RCUK Digital Theme's NEMODE project. The ReadiPeDeX project aims to conduct open innovation competitions to access the feasibility and evaluate the impact of Blockchain (and related technology) and cryptocurrencies on a personal data exchange ecosystem such as the HATs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2472F642-BB7C-46AF-9ADC-D92D2AE0FE47</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6167ac7376.02523097</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.hubofallthings.com/home</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The HAT HyperData Browser is a - 'browser' of how data is linked to other data in other places and a way to view the linkages and clusters of data.
