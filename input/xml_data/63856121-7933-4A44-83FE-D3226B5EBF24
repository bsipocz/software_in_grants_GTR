The planning, management and operation of many services rely on optimisation for efficient and cost effective delivery of services. With an ever growing demand for services, the need for efficient operations is becoming more critical.


Transportation is a major beneficiary of research and development of optimisation techniques. The benefits are observed in a reduction of costs through the more efficient running of railways, an increase in the provided services by airlines through better allocation of aircraft and an improvement in the on-time performance of airlines and railway operators through the better integration of crew and aircraft. However, the ability to maintain reduced costs and deliver efficient operations is limited by our capacity to solve optimisation problems of ever growing complexity. Further advances in transportation and other industries will be delivered through the research and development of solution techniques for optimisation problems.


The aim of this research is to improve current optimisation techniques to extend the domain of solvable problems beyond current limits. The research will draw upon current research of two closely related fields of mathematical optimisation---mixed integer programming (MIP) and decomposition techniques. The inexact MIP solution approach of large-neighbourhood search is valuable for finding good solutions to optimisation problems. While the exact decomposition technique of Benders' decomposition greatly simplifies problem formulations and provides an effective solution approach. The recent developments in large-neighbourhood search will be employed to significantly enhance the solution algorithm of Benders' decomposition. This project will exploit synergies from the integration these two methods to extend current capabilities for solving large-scale optimisation problems.


This project will investigate the enhancement of Benders' decomposition and identify strategies to effectively employ parallel computing infrastructure. The fellowship will achieve the following:

1) The production of a software package for applying Benders' decomposition to general large-scale optimisation problems. An enhanced solver will be developed through the integration of Benders' decomposition with large-neighbourhood search. The resulting software will be capable of solving large-scale optimisation problems from industry and academia.

2) The development of novel parallelisation schemes for Benders' decomposition using the framework of large-neighbourhood search heuristics. The parallelisation schemes will exploit modern computing architecture to significantly reduce solution run times. Further, the algorithmic development will lay the ground work for future parallel computing research.


The developed software will provide tools to apply Benders' decomposition to optimisation problems arising in academia and industry. This will be demonstrated through interdisciplinary collaborative projects in transportation, bioinformatics and climate science. In particular, the recovery of flight schedules after disruption will be investigated, optimisation techniques will be applied to analyse viral sequences and novel algorithms will be employed to identify of strong winds that converge into the jet streams. To facilitate the transfer of knowledge to industry and the wider academic community the available software and solution algorithms will be made freely available for academic use.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Optimisation creates a smarter, cleaner and more efficient society. This is achieved by the better utilisation of resources and the minimisation of waste. The goal of this fellowship is to develop tools to solve problems that decrease emissions through a better use of resources, reduce the severity of transportation delays through better planning and improve the efficiency of energy supply. Improving existing optimisation techniques impacts researchers, students, decision makers in industry, and the general public.

Mixed integer programming (MIP) is an optimisation technique that has many practical applications in industry. This fellowship will develop tools to effectively solve resource utilisation problems that commonly arise in transportation, supply chain management, manufacturing and energy supply. Applications from the airline industry will be used throughout this fellowship, facilitating the direct transfer of knowledge to industry. This fellowship will also achieve an impact in railway transportation, given the strong link between airline and railway resource utilisation problems. With the UK Government proposals of high speed rail and transportation for northern England, tools for efficient resource utilisation are crucial. The research of this fellowship will impact current and future UK Government investment in transportation by delivering methods to solve problems in timetabling, crew and resource scheduling, and disruption management that will reduce operating costs and improve service delivery. Industry decision makers will benefit from the algorithmic development of the fellowship through faster solution run times that will improve the flexibility and adaptability of decision support systems. 

The proposed research will improve solution algorithms to solve large-scale optimisation problems. The general nature of the algorithmic improvements will advance many areas of industrial and practical research. The improved solution algorithms will allow applied researchers to consider problems of greater complexity, whereby extending our knowledge and understanding in fields such as transportation, engineering, biology and climate science. Algorithmic advancements have a long ranging impact, by permitting future researchers to consider problems currently rendered unsolvable with modern solver technology. As such, this fellowship will advance the solving capabilities for industrial problems over the next 5-10 years.

The mathematical programming software industry will benefit from the algorithmic developments of this fellowship. This fellowship will deliver a state-of-the-art Benders' decomposition solver, which is currently not available in the major commercial MIP solvers. Proving the capabilities of Benders' decomposition as a general solution approach will benefit future solver development and improve the available technologies for industry.

All levels of academia, across many different fields, will be engaged through the activities of this fellowship. The general Benders' decomposition solver developed during this fellowship will be made freely available on the project website. Additionally, educational material regarding Benders' decomposition and other decomposition techniques will accompany this software. The available software and educational material will impact academia through material for self-directed learning that will be supported by the algorithmic and application focused publications. 

There is a significant lack in understanding of MIP within the general public and some areas of the wider academic community. As such, difficulties arise in communicating the impact of MIP research. Education is a feature of this fellowship. The improvement of transportation services for the general public through the use of optimisation will be explained through outreach education tools. Outreach will also engage with an academic audience, promoting valuable optimisation techniques and the available tools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>264933</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P003060/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0F2F1A7-287A-4B6F-AA0E-74A55BB4DEE4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Aspects of OR</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
