At the same time, they would be able to network with great teachers and hear about their inspiring stories/best practices from other parents.

The web app looks to fill information/ experience gaps by connecting parents-schools-teachers. The ?Schools? section visualize in one screen selected data on cut-off area, admission criteria, performance, compiled external rankings, and location/profile of great teachers recommended by other parents. The site will also include analytic modules that complement this data with other KPIs. Examples include mapping of student subject achievements vs job market trend or text visualization DNA of schools based of parents? thought on the particular schools. The ?Great Teachers? section posts other parents? their vivid account of great teachers in a social network format. Only stories that have been approved by the teacher being discussed will be posted, and the story will be vetted by others. The objective is to offer parents more color to hard data, and induce more natural interaction between parents and teachers to share inspiring stories/wisdom. Business model is more robust this way as it does not rely on ads, and we can even scale it up internationally. There are numerous ways to monetize. For example, we can secure a LT agreement with property agencies or adopt a tiered subscription model (similar to LinkedIn) for heavy users. 

How are we differentiated for other websites?
1. Approachable (vs accessible). Executing this was my initial inspiration. Everyone is bombarded with data so the art is in the how: delivering the relevant information catered to a specific user. In the ?how?, I feel most of peer sites leave out 80% of the population who are not as savvy with statistics or even just assessing numbers or charts.
2. Embracing change. I believe the existing school-centric education model (legacy of industrial revolution) will change driven by both technological and socioeconomic catalysts. There have been numerous alternative models springing up. The website will approach information and data with the underlying assumption that we are in this transition period. 
3. Analytical tools. We will offer various analytical tools so that parents can make more informed decisions as they weigh multiple aspects for their children. In addition to some tools aforementioned, parents would also be able to rank schools based on what they consider important. We can also run statistical analysis, for example, to see how English proficiency level or value added for a school compares considering non-native English speaking students.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">751285</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
