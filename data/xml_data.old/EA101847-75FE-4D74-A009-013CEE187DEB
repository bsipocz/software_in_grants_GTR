Indeed, Lino Miccich&amp;eacute;, one of Italy's most respected film critics, has recently ranked Bellocchio as the greatest post-1960s director. However, Bellocchio is practically unknown in the English-speaking world, and no monographs on him in English exist. In Italy and France, monographs have been written on Bellocchio, but tend to follow the format of the film-by-film analysis, which does not allow for the in-depth discussion of underlying themes. In Italy there have also been many edited works and collections of articles published, especially in the past 5 years, but these present a fragmentary analysis of the director's work, and none treat the two arguments that I explore (politics and psychoanalysis) in any depth. The research is timely as it fits into a growing interest in Bellocchio's cinema, evidenced in a number of recent papers given on his work in England and America, in new postgraduate research, and in retrospectives of his cinema screened recently in London and elsewhere. \n\nAims and Objectives. \nThis monograph proposes to introduce Bellocchio's cinema to the English-speaking public, focusing on the most significant aspects of his work - politics and psychoanalysis - and locating his filmmaking within the context of Italian and European filmmaking more generally. \n\nThe objectives are: \n1. To analyse the political side of Bellocchio's cinema, in particular exploring the relationship between recording political events through documentary(style)-filming, though allegorical filming and re-recording events from different points in time and different perspectives. \n\n2. To analyse the psychoanalytical side of Bellocchio's cinema, looking particularly at issues of filming subjectivity. \n\n3. to provide a research resource for further research on Bellocchio and on poliical and psychoanalytical filmmaking in Italy by the provision of complete filmographies and bibliographies. \n\nApplications and Benefits.\nThe main potential applications of the research will be in teaching and research. The monograph should provide a better understanding of a director who has been neglected in the English-speaking world, thus expanding the boundaries of the rigid canon of Italian filmmakers discussed in the Anglo-American academic environment. In addition, the monograph will also be of interest to scholars working on the cultural and political history of contemporary Italy, and to film scholars in general who are interested in the representation of political and psychoanalytical ideas in cinema.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25907</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Marco Bellocchio's political cinema</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5565F826-4F01-44E3-8640-E1EFB6194546</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk given at University of Birmingham to disseminate research findings on return from AHRC research leave. 25 people attended and this led to discussion and questions after the talk.

Key findings are: 

1) New interpretations enabled by an analysis of the psychoanalysis practiced by Bellocchio's long-standing analyst, Massimo Faglioli. This allows the rather opaque films from the 1980s and 1990s, in particular, to be more adequately understood. It also sheds further light on the place of psychoanalysis in the history of Italian cinema. 
 
 2) A better understanding of the relationship between public and private and the political and personal in the making of politically engaged filmmaking and the interrelationship of collective action and private responsibility, objectivity and subjectivity, and the relationship between transformation within and transformation without. This gives insight into how to make films which have the capacity to transform spectator's political leanings. 
 
 3) The discovery that the resistant relationship with the 'outside' is not just in relation to particular political positions, but affects almost all levels of Bellocchio's film-making - from the kind of production and distribution circuits he uses to the kind of psychoanalysis found in his films, the way he portrays women, his approach to political material, and his integrating and overturning of cinematic and cultural traditions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Political thinktanks looking at the radicalisation of oppositional behaviours, particularly how these develop and change over one person's lifetime.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>458E1123-30F2-408B-B6DC-8E2248FE9FBB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6335418667.95664577923b66</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8944A84B-B157-485E-9025-AB7330ABB499</gtr:id><gtr:title>Marco Bellocchio: The Cinematic I in the Political Sphere</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c8f84a5582c0e50a27fa740ff57e3f30"><gtr:id>c8f84a5582c0e50a27fa740ff57e3f30</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brook Clodagh J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780802096517</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_20794465573bf30f08</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A33D591E-DA76-4DE6-A410-05A973606BEE</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Spectacle of the Unseen: Marco Bellocchio and Lure of the Catholic Church</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Italian Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f5aa14004d5dc791fd7c92460a37bfe5"><gtr:id>f5aa14004d5dc791fd7c92460a37bfe5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brook C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542e6e2055a951.72015216</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E000886/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E7378EED-C28D-4F1E-9E28-5D9E75964912</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Italian studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
