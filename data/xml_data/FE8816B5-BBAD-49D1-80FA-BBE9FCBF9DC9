This bid seeks to build upon and extend the methods developed and explored in the previous research. Funding is requested to support a collaboration between CFPR and Pulse Roll Label Products Ltd., a specialist manufacturer of inks and varnishes for the label printing and the packaging industries. The collaboration will use the results of the 2004 research by exploiting recent developments in inkjet technology to enable Pulse to develop innovative UV cure ink products for commercial print applications, thus giving them an advantage in the field. 

Today, the field of colour printing is becoming increasingly more technical and remote from traditional methods of the application of colour in the physical world. The way an artist mixes and applies colour is fundamentally different to the digital reproduction of colour and coloured images. An artist's approach to colour printing is concerned with the physical mixing of pigments that are then applied as layers of colour, whereas the digital reproduction of colour is reliant on computational colour modelling to provide accurate numerical data for reproduction. Artists using digital colour are now becoming cognisant in an increasingly technical environment that demands more understanding of different colour spaces, characterisation of printer hardware and paper and an array of file formats. The research developed by Parraman (2004) demonstrated that a more practical knowledge and perceptual understanding of colour can be formulated from the perspective of traditional methods by physically mixing colour pigments and overlayering colour. 

In 2004, the technological capabilities and colour science were not ready for exploitation, in part because of limitations in the capability of inkjet print heads. Inkjet printing technology and knowledge has matured, and recent improvements in print head technology and software have increased the potential to inkjet print a wider range of inks onto a wider variety of materials. The previous research will now allow the use of a range of colorants that expand the current process colour set (bespoke colour palettes that match artists colours) spot colours (Pantone) pigments and decorative inks (metallic, mica, gloss) and novel colorants (fluorescent and colour changing) onto materials including leather, wallpaper, metallic card, plastic.

As demonstrated at industrial print expos, the shift from the traditional screenprint and lithography market to high-speed inkjet printing is partially due to developments in UV curable inks, which have better adhesion to a range of materials, resulting in a diversity of novel print applications, including: decorative printing for packaging, textiles and labelling. This development in UV curing creates greater potential for layering in relation to the findings of the 2004 research. Additionally it creates further potential for commercial exploitation for printer and ink manufacturers to develop UV curing inks. 

Pulse, who produce UV curable, water-based inks and varnishes for flexography (flexo), screen and letterpress printing, wish to address colour printing from the perspective of traditional overlayering of colour to create secondary colour effects. This proposal will move beyond halftoning and process colours - CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black) towards the development of custom pigments and decorative inks to obtain new colour mixtures.

This proposal seeks to undertake collaboration with an industrial partner in order to exploit developments in UV curable inks and industrial print heads printing higher viscosity inks combined with the previous research methodology. The results should lead to new methods for printing from a practitioner perspective aligned more closely to the creative arts and creative industries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>New methodological and practical approaches to printing in relation to labelling and packaging, design and digital print. 

The impact will be measured through the ability to make commercial artwork that is conceived using the same methodological approach as currently used by artists as applied in an industrial context. This will lead to skills development, training and new knowledge for the collaborators involved including Pulse employees, CFPR staff and workshop attendees in new methodological approaches to printed colour.

Through the National Gallery seminar, current interest in the methods of testing the multi layering of inks, development of custom colour palettes using traditional artists based pigments would have new implications and impact for colour reproduction of old master paintings, and could provide the heritage sector with new ways of producing facsimiles of original works. 

The different methods for measuring the printed inks are highly important for different academic and industrial communities. To gain quantitative data, colour, density and gonio (multi-dimensional) measurements are necessary for parity and metrics, and commercial exploitation. To provide useful information for the creative community high quality microphotography, printed samples and application ideas are necessary to perceive textural appreciation of ink on paper. 

Results will be published via the CFPR website, and through journals including The Journal of Imaging Science and Technology, Journal of the International Association of Colour, and through the Society of Dyers and Colourists. The journals will be aimed at the colour science community, wideformat printing industry and academics. 

Printed samples will be demonstrated at LabelExpo to commercial and industrial printers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80218</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of prints made by the painting rig that demonstrates the evolution of the hardware and software.

In the 21st century, and due to the impact of digital technologies, this emphasis has shifted from the mass production of exactly repeatable images, to the ability for the mass customisation for one. The lecture explored the idea of mass customisation towards bespoke and personalised printing services for 'one', and how this new state-of-the-art has evolved as a hybridity of many different processes and materials.

A series of talks by UWE Bristol artists, designers, academics and researchers about the work they do and the thinking it involves and inspires. Organised in partnership with Arnolfini. The event series at the Arnolfini is to consider the relationship between thinking and making and the role of the practitioner in the 21st century.

Inspired by the meticulous painting methods by artists such as Van Gogh and Seurat, the objective for this prototype was to create a vector-driven painting machine that applied a brush loaded with paint to paper in a methodical and mechanical way, yet remain human analogous. The difference was that although the vector marks (digital) could be created in the same way, the resulting painted brush strokes (analogue) were not. Based on the placement of the brush on the paper and the flow of paint, that each painted brush stroke was similar but not exactly the same, thus creating a non-uniform but harmonious effect across the paper surface. 

The project has involved: paint production and colour mixing (to investigate the layering capabilities of inks and paints), robotics (building a printing rig that is capable of holding different pens, brushes and move them in a highly controlled way), software writing (that segments pictures according into layers in preparation for applying coloured strokes)

The ink and prototype project has inspired discussions with ink manufacturers (about novel ways of applying paint that emulates the brush strokes of artists), printers ( demonstrating alternative methods of halftoning and colour separating), artists (by showing how the prototype can be used as an iterative and problem solving tool), and with the potential for tactile pictures for the visually impaired.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C320288E-42AF-44AC-A20B-2A73B88D8170</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc7baaa78ec5.06535776</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This is a highly experimental prototype printing-rig and in its early stages of development, that has explored alternatives to halftoning and CMYK colour printing, and an investigation of over-layering of opaque and translucent colour. The project has been truly cross-disciplinary in its development, involving robotics, computer programming, ink formulation and colour mixing, colour imaging and texture appearance.

Our findings depart from halftoning methods (dots, pixels, pattern screens), to explore vector based (non-photographic rendering methods and autographic) methods for image generation. 

It also explores the development and application of vector driven methods to drive brushes, pens and other artists' tools to create reproducible artworks.

The novelty here is that the artist can make multiples of the same image or try different colours or develop variations - as one would make a print. The difference here is that whilst the process is digitally driven and colours are machine applied, it uses analogue methods and materials to make the image and captures the gestural marks of the artist.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The open source software, developed using Processing 2, can be accessed at http://www.uwe.ac.uk/sca/research/cfpr/research/twoandahalfD/auto%20segmentation%20how_to.html

The printing machine utilises an implement, such as a paintbrush, to automatically make marks on a page using inks or paints. Although the software automatically segments an image into print layers and predetermines stroke marks, the user can adjust many different settings to refine the printed output. 

The auto-segmentation method analyses and converts pixels into vectors. The algorithm automatically separates the image into coloured layers. The layers are determined by visual properties, specifically edge strength, texture direction, x/y pixel adjacency, and hue/saturation/ brightness. The auto segmentation method has been developed using Processing 2, an open source programming language and development environment. *You will require Processing version 2 to run our program.

Auto-segmentation - where bitmap based images (bit-for-bit, raster graphics, pixels, points, image, jpeg) such as photos, screengrabs, iPad art can be converted to vectors. The algorithm automatically separates the image into coloured layers. The layers are determined by: edge strength, texture direction, x/y pixel adjacency, hue/saturation/ brightness. This approach is inspired by the Non-photorealistic rendering algorithms for texture directionality described by Kasao et al through several papers (Kasao, 2006; Kasao 1998a; Kasao1998b). 

Autographic - where vector based graphics (paths, points, handles, anchors, B&amp;eacute;zier curves, smooth lines) such as AutoCad Illustrator, Freehand, can be exported as vector based images (line work, x-y-z, postscript, svg, animation). Layers, brush dimensions and lengths, characterisation of brush strokes can be maintained and used to drive the painting machine. This approach is inspired by Direct Write printing processes (Clem and Bell, 2013; Lewis, 2006).</gtr:description><gtr:id>6DBD1F5C-E02F-41B9-ACC1-76A8A6321819</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The auto-segmentation approach, allows the program to convert the pixels in a picture/photograph into vector paths that can be used to drive a paintbrush or pen on the printing machine. Although the program performs most of the segmenting, the user can manually adjust many different settings to achieve the desired printed output. 
Texture Smoothing - as the following figure illustrates, reduces the complexity of vector direction in the image, resulting in a decrease in texture noise. 
Min Width - describes the minimum width of the stroke, which emulates the size of the paintbrush that will be used in the painting machine. For example, if a high degree of fine detail is required, the number is set to low and a fine brush is used. If a thicker brush is required, set this high (measurements in mm). 
 Max Width (Layer) - describes the maximum possible width of the stroke, encapsulating the spread of bristles, permitting variation in width across the length of a single stroke. This specifies the width per layer, and will automatically set itself to the maximum width available when brush strokes are generated by the software.
 Max Width (global) - Allows the user to set the maximum desirable width of stroke for all layers. Each layer may not attain the maximum width, which can be inspected via Max Width (layer). 
 Max Length (Layer) - describes the maximum length of the brush stroke per layer. This can also be changed for each layer of the print, but will be automatically updated to represent the longest stroke in the layer after stroke generation. Longer brush strokes suit a certain style of print, for a pointillist style then select a short stroke length (measurements in mm).
 Max Length (global) - Allows the user to set the maximum desirable length of stroke for all layers. Each layer may not attain the maximum length, which can be inspected via Max Length (layer).
Bleed - The program default setting will prevent each layer of colour from overlapping. However, by adjusting the bleed of the layers, the density of the stroke can be modified by increasing the bleed, and thus forcing the layers and colours to overlap. This changes the appearance of the image to create a more gestural effect that might be more appropriate for a watercolour painting, as opposed to a more hard edge graphic effect by maintaining edge definition</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc8e0dacbc73.66899258</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Auto-segmentation using stroke based rendering</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.uwe.ac.uk/sca/research/cfpr/research/twoandahalfD/auto%20segmentation%20how_to.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Online documentation and source code for the texture analysis algorithm used in the project The Development of Novel Inkjet Inks'.

These painting machines have undergone various iterations and refinements. We began by hacking a vinyl-cutting plotter and replaced the cutting head for a paintbrush holder. 

A second machine, a low cost wood router kit with 3 degrees of freedom (x, y and z) was modified to carry a paintbrush and other deposition tools. The machine has a printable area of 310mm by 260mm and a range of 40mm vertically. The machine is built from an extruded aluminium frame and NEMA17 stepper motors drive the x-y and the z axis. 

The third generation machine has a printable area of approximately 1.3 x 1.3 metres, again constructed to our specification. It comfortably takes an A0 sheet of paper and enables us to make much larger gestural paintings.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F826F9C0-73B8-4DEA-8434-9CCF1921B716</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Variations include methods to load the brush with paint, such as a paint pot-holder that could rotate underneath the brush and rotate away to enable excess paint to be removed as the brush is drawn up. 

The software communicates using the GCode standard protocol for CNC machine operation. To replicate our printing machine, you need to adapt a CNC wood router to hold a paintbrush. Our paintbrush holder was 3D printed, and the model files are also available online to 3D print.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc8f3b88f906.01342911</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Painting/drawing
