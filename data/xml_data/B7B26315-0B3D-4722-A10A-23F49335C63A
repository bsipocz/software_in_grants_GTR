and its Manufacturing</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M507830/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The project aims to develop a novel energy efficient dew point air cooler and associated manufacturing process, through
the close collaboration among the leading UK/China Universities with the most advanced air cooling technologies and the
top China/UK companies having strong manufacturing capacities in instruments and fans. It involves four technical tasks:
(1) development of the cooler design and optimization tool and determination of cooler performance data (Month 1-6, led by
Hull, with Tsinghua and ebm-papst); (2) construction and testing of a 4 kW rated cooler, and identification of associated
manufacturing machines/tools (Month 7-14, led by Hull, with ebm-papst and Sinogreen); (3) development of a
manufacturing process with a computerised energy management system, and production of a 20 kW rated cooler (Month 7-
18, led by Sinogreen, with Tsinghua, ebm-papst and Hull); and (4) installation, real-time measurement, public
demonstration and marketing preparation of the cooler (Month 19-24, led by Sinogreen, with Tsinghua and Hull).
It is expected that (1) a combination of the energy management system and modular/numerical manufacturing
machines/tools will reduce energy use of the manufacturing process by around 20%; (2) the new cooler will achieve around
25% higher cooling efficiency and 40% higher COP, compared with existing dew point air coolers. This exciting leapforward
in technological development could create a new type of air cooler that has comparable price/size to traditional
vapour compression air conditioners but significantly higher COP over the traditional ones (7 to 8 times higher). This
distinguished technological advance should open up an enormous new global business in the air conditioning sector, thus
creating considerable impact on the economy, industry and the environment within the UK, China and beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential impacts of the project are: (1) The project partners, together with associated material/components suppliers and
unit installers, will directly benefit from the cooler and fan/control businesses through the products sale/installation, as well
as knowledge/technology transfers on global scale; (2) UK industry as a whole will benefit by enhanced competitiveness, increased sales, and improved employment opportunities; (3) The ultimate end users will benefit by reduced energy costs
and improved internal environments; (4) Governments of the UK, China and other countries which install this kind of
products will benefit by potentially achieving significant reductions in fossil fuel use, thereby contributing to progress
towards its national carbon reduction targets.
To enable achieving the above predicted impacts, the project team members have planned a number complementary
activities and routes. First of all, they will work closely to ensure successful completion of the project, thus delivering four
high standard deliverables: (1) a pre-production prototype dew point air cooler; (2) a clean and energy efficient
manufacturing process; (3) an experimental prototype cooler and associated test rig; and (4) a computerised cooler design
and optimization tool. These will formulate the foundation for conveying the predicted impacts into reality. In parallel, the
project members will implement appropriate exploitation and dissemination activities detailed below.
Sinogreen, which is the leading industrial organisations of the project, will organise the exploitation and commercial
promotion activities, along with ebm-papst UK and two academic partners (Hull/Tsinghua). They will (1) determine the
data/knowledge management methods (by Month 1); (2) undertake the IP applications and sign up the license agreement
(between Month 1 and 20); (3) develop and sign-up a joint business agreement (by month 20); (4) develop the business
models for the cooler and fan (by Month 24); (5) develop the technology promotion plans for the cooler and fan (by Month
24); and in particular (6) introduce the coolers into a few identified building projects, e.g., Shanxi (China) High-Tech
Development Zone (government funded) project which would install around 100 dew point air coolers (50kW rated each),
Hull's Maritime Building IT Centre which, designed by NPS Humber Ltd, will install 5 dew point air coolers (60kW rated
each), and the Hull (UK's City of Culture 2017)'s History Centre which, designed by NPS Humber Ltd, will install a 100kW
rated dew point air cooler. Provided that project outcomes are successful, the above commercial orders should be in place
by the end of the project.
Hull will lead a dissemination group (comprising Hull, Tsinghua, Sinogreen, and ebm-papst) to manage various planned
dissemination activities: (I) developing a project website (by Month 1); (II) organising two workshops (including distribution
of the project leaflets): one in Hull (by Month 12) to showcase the operation of the experimental prototype cooler (4kW
rated), test rig, and computerised design and optimization tool, and the second in Sinogreen (by Month 24) to demonstrate
the operation of the cooler's manufacturing and pre-production prototype cooler (20kW rated) installed in Sinogreen's
instrument workshop; (IV) exhibitting the experimental prototype cooler (4kW rated) at two great events: one in the UK
(Eco-build, March 2016), and the second in China (Refregeration Exhibit, August 2016); (V) publishing eight journal papers,
and presenting the project findings in at least two conferences; and (VI) making/uploading three videos ((1) experimental
prototype cooler and its operational principle, (2) pre-production prototype cooler and associated manufacturing process,
and (3) demonstration of the pre-production prototype cooler) in a social network , e.g., YouTube.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>381235</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ebm-papst UK Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Consortium Agreement</gtr:description><gtr:id>08BC311F-07AB-4664-B231-928E92B89867</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- 2 cooler prototypes

This project is jointly funded by the UK EPSRC (M507830/1), Innovate-UK (TSB 42438-290245), as well as China Ministry of Science and Technology, under the call scheme of Manufacturing Sustainability (with China) and attracting fund of &amp;pound;1.165m. The University of Hull led up a consortium comprising of ebm-papst UK, Tsinghua University and Sinogreen in China, throughout the process, achieving a remarkable success that was highly valued by the Innovate-UK. 
This water-based dew-point air cooler makes use of a novel guideless complex heat exchanger and intermittent water supply operational scheme. The heat exchanger, comprising of numerous complex heat exchanging sheets and each of which being the combination of a dry-side-material and a wet-side-material, enables the reduced air-flow resistance and increased heat transfer area. The excellent absorption capacity of the wet-side-material enables it to retain water for a long period, thus creating an intermittent water supply opportunity that can minimize the water usage and pump power. Compared to existing dew-point air coolers, the new unit can obtain the significantly higher energy and cooling efficiencies. To protect these research findings, the consortium members have filed two patents, i.e., 'Heat Exchanger Apparatus (GB1617362)' and 'A Specialist Water Sprayer Unit with Dense and Controlled Openings Layout (ZL2016 2 0563598.X)'.
To give an example, a 100m2 of house in the UK may have a cooling load of 4kW which may be served by either a mechanical vapour compression based air cooler, a currently available dew point air cooler, or our new dew point air cooler. The first two coolers require electrical power inputs of 1,350W and 225W respectively, while our new cooler, which has the comparable size and cost to the traditional coolers, requires only 90W. The significantly lower energy need and competitive price/size of the new cooler will open up an enormous new global business in air conditioning sector, thus creating a great impact on the economy, industry and environment within the UK, China and beyond. 
The project workshop was held at University of Hull on afternoon of 20th February 2017. More than 50 delegates from Germany, Sweden, Poland, France, Greece, UK and China gathered together to initiate such an exciting event. Professor James Gilbert and Dr Kevin Fancey chaired the afternoon session. Professor Alfred Bliek, who is the head of School of Engineering and Computer Science, delivered an opening and welcome speech. Mr Jonathan Cant, who is the Head of Research Fund Office of the University of Hull, gave a wonderful induction of Hull University and endorsed the University's support to such a significant international collaborative project. Dr Ben Walsh, who is the Innovate-UK Lead Technologist, gave the overview of the Innovate-UK and its fund schemes. Professor Xudong Zhao, who is the Coordinator of the project and Director of Research of the Engineering School, provided an overview of the project that addressed the aim, tasks, as well as the up-to-date achievement of the project. Dr Kevin Fancey from University of Hull gave a brief of the new combination method between the dry and wet side materials of the heat exchanging sheet. Mr Geoff Lockwood, who is Technical Director of ebm-papst UK, introduced the works relating to the fan selection, CFD simulation for fluid movement, as well as the control and display system development. All participants had a wide range of discussion of the technology and observed the real time operation of the 4kW rated prototype cooler. In the end, Dr Mahomed Jassat, who is Innovate UK project monitor officer, outlined the project target and actual achievement, and delivered a strong endorsement and warm congratulations to the success of the project team. 
 
In the evening, the delegates joined a lovely dinner party at 1884 Dock Street Kitchen, involving Dr. Maggie McGowan who presented the University's spirit. Prof. David Atkinson, who is the Associate Dean of the Faculty of Science and Engineering, had a dinner with the delegates on the first day of arrival, showing his warm welcome and celebration to this important event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58be8dabc40b66.30088076</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1156500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EU H2020 - MSCA-RISE-2016</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>734340 - DEW-COOL-4-CDC</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>DA55119B-12C3-403F-8F2F-572E3D4D5C1B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58be8ae0284859.52108243</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The first prototype has been licensed to Keda Ltd; and has been commercialised.

Each metal sheet 10 has a corrugated surface, with fabric (e.g. Coolmax-2) covering at least a portion of one surface of the metal sheet to promote evaporation. A wetting agent (e.g. LiCl/Polyvinyl-Alcohol (PVA) solution) is provided in the fabric to promote wetting of the fabric, and 10 also acts as an anti-microbial agent. The fabric preferably covers all of the corrugated surface, and two planar portions are provided above and below the corrugated surface respectively. In use, the heat exchanger apparatus is disposed with a long side vertical and the corrugated surface is disposed on a middle portion, the upper planar portion is contiguous with an air outlet, and/or the lower planar portion is contiguous with an air 15 inlet. In a preferred embodiment, the corrugated surface has in cross-section a profile of a periodic waveform, wherein the peak-to-peak distance is 11.6 mm, the amplitude is 2.5 mm, and corrugations intersect the plane of the heat exchanger apparatus at an angle to that plane of 50 degrees. Also disclosed are a cooling system incorporating the heat exchanger apparatus and methods of operating the cooling system, involving 20 intermittently operating a water supply system for the application of water to the fabric, and/or, recirculating water from a water sump using the water supply system.</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>EP/M507830/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>4436B1C8-D812-4E0C-BE90-290A1323F4AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The novel dew point air conditioner was developed through a research project entitled &amp;quot;Key Technologies for Enhancing Energy Efficiency of the Dew Point Air Cooler and its Manufacturing&amp;quot;, which is funded by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), Innovate UK and Ministry of Science and Technology of China (EP/M507830/1). The novel dew point cooling technology will bring about enormous economic, environmental and sustainability benefits to the UK, China and worldwide. 
 
Air conditioning is an enormous world-wide business with the global market of around &amp;pound;55 billion per annum. The new type of dew point air conditioner, owing to its significantly higher COP over the traditional ones (10 to 16 times higher), will overcome the difficulties remaining with the existing dew point air conditioners, i.e. larger size, larger flow rate and higher cost, and thus can have its sizes and capital cost reduced to a level comparable to the traditional vapour compression air conditioners. 

Built on the above advantages and the joint venture developed by the UK and China partners, the new air conditioner business is high likely to achieve around &amp;pound;120 million of global annual sales and &amp;pound;24 million of annual interest by 2026. It should be addressed that the joint venture is part of the project targets and the initial plan is to place its head-quarter in the UK and manufacturing base in China, based on the industrial partners (Sinogreen and ebm-papst)' existing facilities and spaces. In the meantime, around &amp;pound;20 million of annual market size will be established on the fan/control-system manufacturing &amp;amp; sale, which are based in an independent UK ebm-papst business and would attract around &amp;pound;4 million of annual interest. 

After 2026, the market sizes of the air conditioner and fan/control system would continue to grow at a rate of 15% to 20% per annum. The project partners, relevant material/components suppliers and unit installers, will directly benefit from the air conditioner and fan/control businesses through product sale/installation, as well as knowledge/technology transfers on the global scale. The UK industry as a whole will benefit by the enhanced competitiveness, increased sale and improved employment opportunities. The end users will benefit by reduced energy costs and improved internal environments. 

This business will also bring about enormous environmental and sustainability benefits that are identified by the reduced CO2 emission and waste dumping, as well as controlled air pollution. Giving an estimated annual installation volume of 0.5 million kW cooling capacity (derived from &amp;pound;120 million of annual sale), the new air conditioners, as replacements to conventional vapour compression air conditioners, would save around 55 million kWh of electricity during a single year operation, thus resulting in reduction in CO2 emission by around 30,000 tonnes. The new air conditioner manufacturing process, owing to around 20% of electrical energy saving potential over the traditional processes, will lead to around 20,000 tonnes of reduced CO2 emission (for 0.5 million kW cooling capacity production). Recycling of the materials (fibres, aluminium foils, plastics, and fluids) during the cooler manufacturing would lead to the reduced waste dumping; while the unit's water flushing and filtering functions against the inlet and discharging air will effectively mitigate the pollution level of the ambient air. This issue is particularly important to China as air contamination (e.g. PM2.5) in China has reached dangerous levels.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Commercial In Confidence</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>58be8fb2724261.82117795</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:patentId>GB1617362.7</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Heat exchange apparatus</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2016</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>(1) Unique geometrical setting enables the increased heat transfer rate and decreased air flow resistance: For each heat exchanging sheet, its inlet and outlet portions are made as the flat geometry for convenience of air and water distribution across the exchanger's channel space; while its main portion is made as the corrugated geometry for increasing the heat transfer area between the two parts of airstreams that results in a higher heat transfer rate. It, meanwhile, can also achieve a lower flow resistance owing to the elimination of the triangular channel supporting guides that are commonly used in flat-plate heat exchangers. 
(2) Enhanced wet surface condition in terms of the water absorption, diffusion and evaporation: A super-performance fibre material layer (i.e. Coolmax-2) as the wet surface of the heat exchanging sheet significantly improves the wet-ability and water diffusivity of the surface, thus enhancing the heat and mass transfer of the heat exchanger; 
(3) The Coolmax-2 fibe layer has also the enhanced water absorption capacity that enables it to hold significant amount of water for a relatively longer period. This creates an opportunity to implement an intermittent water supply scheme that can minimize the water usage and water pump power consumption, and meanwhile, prevent the formation of water film on the surface that could restrain the evaporation of water; and 
(4) Water could be delivered by an in-house tap, thus removing the use of a water pump and associated power consumption.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Both Sinogreen and Chengdu Puchuang Information Technology Co Ltd want to take up this technology into market.
