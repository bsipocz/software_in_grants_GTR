Here, we propose a paradigm shift to overcome these limitations and develop new quantum light sources by exploiting sculptured electromagnetic modes in nano-dielectric architectures to boost light-matter interactions by many orders of magnitude, without the absorption, quenching and heating drawbacks of plasmonics. Our team encompasses expertise in nano-photonics, plasmonics, single molecule spectroscopy, and photonic local density of state mapping by cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, and is uniquely placed to address dielectric nanophotonics beyond the limitations of metallic nano-systems. 

Our approach to light design in nanoscale structures is based on the manipulation of Mie resonances in dielectric nanoparticles. Nanodielectrics can nano-localise electromagnetic fields with no optical losses, control light fluorescence by exploiting co-localised electric and magnetic modes as well as their interference, and offer additional degrees of freedom for nonlinear conversion with unprecedented efficiency. 

We aim to develop bright nanoscale quantum sources of single and pair photons through nanoscale dielectric antennas and cavities. We will develop the fundamental understanding of the working principles of nano dielectrics in terms of resonance tuning, spatial sculpturing of near fields, and the photonic density of states, and then we will utilise them for enhancement of single emitter fluorescence and nonlinear photon (pair) conversion.

Our ultimate goal is to obtain a bright source of individual and correlated photons at room temperature with sub-wavelength size suitable for integration on quantum circuits on chips. We envisage that nano-dielectrics can lead to practical nano-scale quantum optics, where plasmonics has failed to deliver mainly due to optical absorption, and reach the milestone of nanoscale photon pair generation which would revolutionise quantum optics, opening a real path to nanoscale engineering of quantum systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal aims to develop bright nanoscale quantum sources of single and pair photons through nanoscale dielectric antennas and cavities, for future nanoscale quantum technology.

The UK is a leader in photonics research and technology, and this programme will develop new disruptive lasing technologies which will ensure that UK photonics community maintains a leading edge by supporting this emerging nanoscale quantum optics research area and foster global economic performance and competitiveness of the UK at an international level. The single photon generation architectures targeted in this proposal are expected to have an impact on the development and commercialisation of a new class of quantum light sources, with potential for integration in opto-electronic systems and compatible with CMOS on-chip technology. The miniaturised light-matter dielectric interfaces would have a significant impact on biomedical and healthcare diagnostics for single-molecule biosensing. 

Short-term impact will be the fundamental understanding of light trapping and optical resonance in nanophotonic dielectric architectures. The proposed fluorescence and nonlinear optics studies will have direct impact in optoelectronic technologies aimed at integrated light sources, switches, modulators etc. If successful the proposed research will not only help to evolve the field of nanophotonics, but will offer a new platform for quantum optics, opening a scientific discussion of the role of nanoscale interactions for quantum technologies. In aiming to combine the fields of nanophotonics with quantum optics we will reach out to and foster interdisciplinary research at the interface between material science, optical physics and quantum science. Additionally, the combination of nano-resonators and fluorescent molecules offers the opportunity to improve sensing for next generation single-molecule biochemical sensing for healthcare technologies.

The project will promote light and light-based technologies and will raise public awareness of the value of photonics research, and nanotechnology. It will also provide high-quality training, mentorship and career development opportunities for the researchers involved in the programme. This project will promote research, at the interface between nanophotonics and quantum optics, and will inform policy makers of how nanotechnology physical science can advance quantum technologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>382499</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P033431/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8ECC9D35-20DE-4F19-8A8A-07D65859D6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Light-Matter Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
