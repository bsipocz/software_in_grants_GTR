Thus, the area of enquiry is broad and aims to bring together questions regarding institutional processes of distribution, marketing and exhibition within enquiries into practices of projection, archiving and curating with new methods of research such as media archaeology. Thus, the aim is to open film and screen studies up to new methods and objects, as well as intensifying the dialogue with other disciplines and practices. In doing so, the Besides the Screen network attempts to understand the continuing transformation of audiovisual media practices. Through workshops, symposia and conference sessions the network will forge links between academics, artists and professionals to refocus film and screen studies on those objects and practices that exist besides the Screen

The project aims to explore the shifting practices and cultures of different forms and events of cinema that exist beside and between screens. In particular it intends to break and reframe the traditional understanding of cinema as collective experience and its institutionalized framework of distributing, displaying and working with images that move. In a constant ever-changing field of audiovisual practices, the network aims to create a new area of research that expands upon and sheds light on processes largely ignored from traditional film and screen studies. The project intends to explore new threads of connections, debate and collaborations within a network of participants, such as students, academics, artists, media labs, and cultural institutions. 

Research will be disseminated through workshops, seminars and performances from May 2014 - April 2016. There will also be a dedicated BtSN website where network members can access details about the network's research activities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Besides the Screen network would achieve impact through a series of workshops, symposia, screenings, post-screening discussions, facilitated networking opportunities &amp;amp; the BtSN website, twitter feed and interactive forum. It is expected that new and established artists working with screen-based media would be utilize these various opportunities able to present and engage in discussion of their work through participation in the screenings, performances and associated discussions facilitated by the Besides the Screen Network. It is also anticipated that small/medium sized distributors and exhibitors of experimental screen based media would reach new audiences, artists and potential collaborators through the events associated with the Besides the Screen network. Furthermore, the symposia, discussions and website would allow space for discussion of how traditional practices of dissemination might be expanded upon and developed, thus enabling artists and professionals to push forward the boundaries of their respective fields. 

There will be an emphasis on collaboration with non-academic partners within the Besides the Screen network. Existing UK partner organizations currently include Bitniks (www.bitnik.org), a media collective investigating digital and analog media and the impact they have on society; Deckspace (http://dek.spc.org), a media lab based in South London; and Exploding Cinema (http://www.explodingcinema.org/) a coalition of film/video makers who seek to develop new modes of exhibition for underground media. It is intended that through collaborative practical workshops, performances and screenings these partner organizations will be brought into contact with each other, and the wider group of artists and academics that make up the BtSN to discuss and challenge traditional methods of production, distribution and exhibition of audiovisual material. 

It is planned that this broad range of activities will encourage participation and engagement between the academic and non-academic members of the network and will act as a focal point to exchange ideas developed during the earlier symposia and workshops. 

It is the intention of the BtSN that all network events will be held at a variety of venues and videos will be made available through the BtSN website (where appropriate) so as to encourage the engagement of as wide an audience as possible with the aims and discussions of the network. By bringing the discussion online, and to other venues outside of academic institutions, it is hoped that the BtSN will continue to develop links and remove barriers to discussion between academics, artists and professionals involved with those myriad practices of projection, exhibition, distribution, marketing (to name but a few) that exist besides the screen.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30957</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A performance of live improvisations &amp;amp; arrangements for synthesisers, electronics, guitar &amp;amp; computer, based upon upcoming works.

Chromatouch (Performance)
Solo music project focusing on improvisation with hardware. Light units are individually affected by control modules, making the environment vibrate. Noisy, melodic, percussive and visually immersive! - Presentation commissioned by the Besides the Screen Network.

Leon Trimble aka Chromatouch is a VJ, filmmaker and audio visual artist who performs live and installs work in the UK &amp;amp;
internationally. He is currently a fellow at Birmingham Open Media - www.bom.org.uk He works with live animation, digital beats, motion graphics, photography and glitch art using nascent and rehashed technology. &amp;quot;As an artist I am using evolving technology not only as a medium in itself but also as subject. Streaming, layering and reinterpreting multiple live art forms simultaneously. Finding where science meets creativity. I dedicate the use of technology and it's tweakability to improvise live images that relate to, and directly influence the current situation, i.e. music, dance, theatre etc.&amp;quot;

His practice largely bases itself on the building of live collaborative digital systems. That could be the notes from a piano that results in multi coloured projected particles or a series of body movements from a performer, learned by a computer that result in corresponding sections of a film being played back. For his live shows he slices and layers recorded material and breaks away into improvised musicianship played from modified instruments or grid based controllers. Each element of sound has a visual representation. His own electronically built synthesisers are a part of this - devices that uses voltage to portray patterns in sound and video simultaneously. Spectral colours are represented, rhythms are present in shifting patterns, and moods are conveyed.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A141BCC8-E910-4964-8761-F7C62D8511B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This performance was part of a programme of live performances during the Besides the Screen event: Projection / Geometry / Performance at Coventry University, 20-22 July 2016.

The Trembling Giant: 19'33&amp;quot; digital video - Patrick Tarrant, UK, 2015
The Trembling Giant is an experimental nature documentary that remediates the iconic landscape of the American
south-west by filming through the take-up reel of a 16mm film projector. While we do not see the 16mm films playing on
the projector, they nonetheless leave their trace as their passage through the mechanism warps the space in front of the
camera, much as their small audio dramas warp our reading of the landscape. The Trembling Giant is also the name of a
clonal colony of quaking aspen tree in Fish Lake Utah which, having survived for sixty thousand years, is now under threat.
Thought to be the largest living organism in the world, this aspen colony is also known as Pando (Latin for 'I Spread') and is
capable of putting up genetically identical stems from its single, vast root system. The bark of the quaking aspen tree
provides one of the 38 Bach flower remedies and is thought to be the cure for any fear whose cause can't be named. This
film is haunted by just such fears.

Patrick Tarrant is a filmmaker and lecturer at London South Bank University who has written on the portrait films of Pedro
Costa (Where Does Your Hidden Smile Lie?) and Ben Rivers (Two Years At Sea). Patrick's films have screened most recently
at the London, Melbourne and Hong Kong International Film Festivals.

When a Circle Meets the Sky: 4'20' digital video - Carla Chan, Hong Kong, 2012/2016
This work reflects on the intriguing relationships among nature, technology and human agency. The video was shot in the
Mojave Desert, USA (2012), and Melchsee-Frutt, Switzerland (2016), with the aid of a custom-made weathervane that
captured reflections of a mirror determined by wind speed and direction at the location.
Conventional cinema is a unidirectional medium in which only things in the front will be captured. In this video, the camera
looks both forward and backward simultaneously. Instead of a cameraperson selecting our perspectives, the artist allows
the wind to choose our views. Nature shoots a film with no human interaction and presence, intensifying the isolation of
the remote desert while at the same time complicating our expected relationships among nature, technology and human
participation in the process of artistic creation.

Carla Chan is a media artist based in Berlin and Hong Kong, where she obtained her bachelor degree in Media Arts from
the School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong. She works with a variety of media, such as video, installation,
photography and interactive media. Much like the never-ending development of new technology, Chan considers media
art as a medium with infinite possibilities for artistic expressions. Minimal in style and form, Chan's works often toy with the
blurred boundaries between reality and illusion, figure and abstraction. Her recent practice focuses on the ambiguity in
nature. Bridging natural transformation and unpredictable computer algorithms, her works are consolidated with a
cohesive dynamic between form, means and content.

Echoes of a Forgotten Embrace: 4' digital video - Apotropia, Italy, 2016
&amp;quot;Echoes of a Forgotten Embrace&amp;quot; takes inspiration from the concept of emotional memory, depicting the encounter of two
lovers in a liminal dimension, a place where movements preserve the memory of the past and create a synthesis of the
entire action. The work has been created with a mix of body projection, light painting, real time randomization and CGI
animation techniques.

APOTROPIA is a duo based in Rome, Italy, consisting of dancer/media artist Antonella Mignone and artist/composer
Cristiano Panepuccia. Their work explores the interconnections between performing arts and all forms of audiovisual
expressions. Their artworks have been showcased in many museums and festivals including Japan Media Arts Festival, The
National Art Center in Tokyo, National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, WRO Media Art Biennale, ART.FAIR Blooom Award,
Hokkaido Museum of Modern Art, Bienal Videofest 2k14, VEA - International Biennial of Video Art and Animation,

Live audiovisual performance that expands on the limits of theatrical projection. Projected images gradually detach from the screen and occupy the space. Shapes made of light change spatial perspectives and modify the screen's flat character, producing volume and depth. Audience, artists and space are integrated in an immersive narrative sustained by cinema's basic elements: light and sound.

Flows: 25 lamps installation - Camille Laurent, Brazil, 2016 
An artificial forest of light made by a matrix of digitally-controlled fluorescent lamps. These urban illumination devices are deposed of their functional aspect in favour of their sensorial qualities. The pulses going from one lamp to another are interpretations of the ephemeral geography of flows in the streets of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo.
Work developed during artist residency at Dahaus (Brazil). Production commissioned by the Besides the Screen Network.

Camille Laurent has dedicated herself to what she calls &amp;quot;light installations&amp;quot; since 2015. She works with light as a means to apprehend the sensible and allow for sensorial expression, employing three main elements: analog/digital control, fluorescent lamps, and machine glitches. She often collaborates with the architectural light design office Lichia and light designers such as Guilherme Bonfanti and Mirella Brandi.

The fact that network events were public facing, included exhibitors and performances, and that they took place outside of large cultural centres enabled positive cultural impacts to be achieved. The general public benefitted from public audiovisual performances in V&amp;iacute;toria (Brazil), S&amp;atilde;o Paulo (Brazil) and Coventry (UK) from artists that would otherwise have been unable to visit these locations. A member of a Mercury Prize nominated music collective performed at the final network event in Coventry, thus raising the profile and the public visibility of the conference and its associated events. The hosting of an exhibition of audiovisual work in Coventry city centre enabled public participation in network events and increased the exposure of the contributing artists. The project also benefitted artists by specifically created the conditions for the presentation of British artists in Brazil and for the collaboration of artists from both countries in performances and filmmaking projects.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B6210198-86C6-4B8B-A44B-01E541BD2455</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df1e8f4d5e53.37617268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This AHRC Networking grant has allowed the continuation and further development of a network of international scholars, artists and practitioners whose work examines the intersection between those texts, processes and practices that exist besides the screen. Through events in both Brazil and the UK, this network has facilitated the interaction of individuals who have gone on to collaborate both within and beyond the network. These collaborations have included publications, conference papers/panels, exhibitions and performances as detailed within the other sections of this submission. &amp;nbsp;The collaborations and connections that have been enabled between the UK and Brazil represent significant achievements for the network. For example, the network has enabled English-speaking scholars to present their work to Brazilian audiences via simultaneous translation and to have their contributions to the edited collection Cinema Apesar da Imagem translated into Portuguese; thus, disseminating their work and ideas beyond their existing audiences. The network has also brought artists, academics, practitioners and students together through the structure and focus of network events. Students in both the UK and Brazil have been active participants in network events and through internal funding from Coventry University, some undergraduate students were able to travel to and participate in one of the network events in Brazil. The contributions of artists and practitioners have been an integral part of all the network events, but particularly during the final event in July 2016 where an academic conference ran alongside a week of exhibitions and performances in a city-centre arts space in Coventry, UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The achievements of the network are already being developed into further network events and publications. 
1. An edited book proposal will shortly be submitted to NYU Press based on the final AHRC funded network event in 2016. The edited collection will contain contributions from over twenty-one authors from across Europe and South America and will be one of the few academic collections to look at the histories, technologies and practices of moving image projection. 
2. A further network event is being organised to take place in V&amp;iacute;toria, Brazil in June 2017 and the theme of this conference concerns VR, Volumetric filmmaking and spatial control. Through further funding from Brazilian government agencies and King's College London, this event will allow the network to continue building and developing links between UK and Brazilian scholars concerned with those texts, processes and practices that exist besides the screen.
3. The project investigators will continue to facilitate network events on a biannual basis. These will be hosted on a rotational basis at the institutions of existing and future network participants.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>23757490-B442-4293-8C03-D4E0AADC9271</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df1e389fe7d9.84676725</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture,
