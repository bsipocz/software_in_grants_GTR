Davy was the foremost 'Man of Science' of his day. He isolated more chemical elements than any individual has before or since. Between October and December 1815, Humphry Davy invented a miners' safety lamp that came to be known as the Davy Lamp. This invention saved countless lives when it was used in Britain and Europe and vastly improved industrial capability. He also had a fascinating life, rising up through the social ranks to become the President of the Royal Society from relatively humble origins and suffering the prejudice that accompanied this rise. His politics and religious beliefs also changed from radical to conservative as his career progressed. But, he was also a Poet: for the whole of his life he wrote poetry, much of which will be published for the first time in the Collected Letters edition. For these reasons, he is an excellent figure to illustrate the impact that society and culture has upon science. It becomes clear from Davy's letters that science is a part of culture; the kinds of experiments that he performs, the methods that he uses, and the relationship that his chemistry has to his poetry, demonstrate that science is influenced by culture, history, and politics. 

Despite the fact that Davy is such an important figure, his letters are almost entirely unpublished. This Fellowship will allow me to edit and annotate the already transcribed letters of Volumes III and IV of the first scholarly edition, identifying who he wrote to, the progress of his chemical discoveries, and his views on poetry, among other things. This work would be disseminated and interpreted at three public events that would be delivered to different audiences. At the Wordsworth Trust, in Grasmere, I will follow a public talk on the Collected Letters with a workshop on the importance of letters in the past and now. At the Royal Institution of Great Britain, the partner of this project, I will give an evening talk in the very lecture theatre in which Davy himself lectured, specifically thinking about how Davy's position as a chemist and a poet can make us reconsider the relationship between science and literature in today's society. At the Woodhorn Museum in Ashington (formerly known as the Woodhorn Colliery Museum), I will give a third public talk, this time as part of the Northumberland History Fair. I will also collaborate with the educational team at Woodhorn to create a day workshop based on the findings of the letters, which also utilises the archive holdings and mining buildings at the museum. The team will deliver this workshop ten times across the autumn of 2016, offering it to local primary schools and eventually reaching 300 pupils. 

After the first year of the Fellowship, which will mainly be spent annotating the letters, I will spend part of my time for six months creating and producing a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC). This will teach a huge, global audience about Davy, his letters, his life, and his legacy. The course will be filmed partly on location at the Royal Institution and will explore - through the example of Davy - the larger issues that this Fellowship addresses. Throughout the whole period of the Fellowship I will be working on developing my own capacities as a research leader, not least in the employment, encouragement, and supervision of a full-time Research Assistant, who - among other tasks - will write two detailed, academic articles on specific aspects of Davy's letters and what these reveal that is new.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research undertaken during the period of this Fellowship will impact on a number of different groups and organisations:

1) Enhancing the research capacity, knowledge, and skills of third-sector organisations (and economic impact):

As is clear from the Project Partner's Letter of Support, the Royal Institution of Great Britain (Ri) stands to gain from this collaboration in a number of ways. The work of the Fellowship will serve to preserve and promote the Ri's archive collections and increase knowledge of the history of this important institution. The Fellowship will publicise the work of the Ri; it will attract more visitors to the building itself (for tours or events) and encourage people to visit the Ri's TV channel. The Fellowship develops an existing successful collaboration and continues to extend the Ri's research capacity beyond science into the field of literary studies. 

The Wordsworth Trust and Woodhorn Museum will similarly benefit from the public events planned at their sites. The Woodhorn Museum events will enhance visitors' experience of the museum, while the Wordsworth Trust will be adding to and expanding an already established interest in letter writing in the early nineteenth century and in its holdings of manuscript letters. All three organisations struggle financially and will benefit economically from the increased footfall associated with these events. 

2) Enhancing cultural enrichment and, thus, quality of life for local communities and the wider public, while also increasing public engagement with research and societal issues.

A number of different kinds of communities and publics will interact and engage with the research produced during this Fellowship. I will reach local and regional audiences (north-east for Woodhorn; north-west for the Wordsworth Trust); a metropolitan audience (at the Ri in London); and a global audience (with the MOOC). I will reach school children and their teachers with the Woodhorn events; an audience generally aged 50+ at the Wordsworth Trust; and an age-diverse audience at the Ri, which is made up of slightly more men than women, with a fair proportion working in or studying science, according to the Ri's Public Programmes report for September 2013 to August 2014. Lancaster University has found that MOOC participants tend to be what are known as 'leisure learners'. On a previous Lancaster University MOOC, over 70% of the participants were international and from all over the world. FutureLearn reports that current MOOC audiences are made up of nearly 60% women, with an even distribution of ages between 18 and 65. 24% of learners do not have degrees already; 49% of learners are working full time; and 56% of learners had not taken an online course before this one. 

Davy is a significant figure to British national heritage (see Case for Support) and this Fellowship will increase knowledge of his legacy to science and society. Audiences will gain an enriched understanding of Britain's industrial past and of scientific achievement. They will also find their preconceptions of scientists challenged and potentially transformed: Davy wrote poetry throughout his life that has a vital and generative relationship to his chemistry. Learning about this will encourage people to rethink some of their ideas about the division of arts and sciences into 'two cultures' and persuade them of the importance of the arts and humanities. Beyond Davy, the Fellowship will engage people in dialogue about the relationships between the arts and science. This will ensure that the public has a role in shaping discussion about the future directions that research might take in this area. I hope that the people I meet and talk to in person, or reach through the school workshops or the MOOC, will feel enriched by the experience of learning about Davy, empowered to identify and question the various agenda of science today, and proud of their regional and/or national heritage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>191049</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Talk at Royal Institution of Great Britain</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9D434D16-3E42-410B-8AFD-6CE00FE00C3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>35 people attended this talk, which discussed: the role of letter writing compared to other forms of communication, such as e-mail; Davy's life and career, as a man of science and a man of letters, specifically focusing on his experiments with nitrous oxide and his work on the miners' safety lamp; issues surrounding the invention of his safety lamp, including the necessity of its invention and the priority dispute that followed; and what Davy's letters reveal about the safety lamp controversy.

I loved my visit and I would love to come again' (pupil); and '[The most surprising/interesting thing was] learning new interesting facts' (pupil). 100% of school children indicated that their visit to Woodhorn made them feel happy (by circling a face on their feedback form indicating 'happy', 'indifferent', or 'sad').</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b8455e581cd2.58475063</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>400</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Scouloudi Historical Awards</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Scouloudi Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A4B49CAE-E2A1-491E-A834-64BB46075308</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bee67dce2da0.22855320</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>FASS IKE</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Lancaster University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>FD27A175-E1F1-4007-BBAF-AD766903AE28</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58beeae93992f8.50167350</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>750</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry (SHAC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>AB7F443F-8A21-4698-A8C7-F60AAA6D15DF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bee6ecccc790.72913481</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9947</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The British Academy</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>SG162243</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>915BFCA3-307C-4FF7-AAFE-0B997328D5B6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c68cd3033ea8.71237178</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Impact Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Lancaster University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D4E45118-2EA6-4B43-A148-ABF0A45DEA79</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58beeb3b1b53c7.53635738</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>6000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Short-term Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Chemical Heritage Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>8EF9CCC3-56CA-48A8-8008-6384B79D8DD0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bee56174bda2.31053795</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Taken together, the programme of public engagement activities enabled by this award has achieved a significant degree of impact beyond academia, and has had a demonstrably positive effect on the lives of several key groups of non-academic stakeholders. The public talks (at the Keats-Shelley House, Rome; Duke's Theatre, Lancaster; the Wordsworth Trust, Grasmere; and the Royal Institution of Great Britain, London) disseminated new, original research findings from the duration of the award to a range of distinct audiences (both in geographic and demographic terms), most of whom would not normally benefit from the publication of an expensive, relatively small-run scholarly edition of letters. From the feedback gathered at these events, there is clear evidence of changes in the views, opinions, or behaviours of the participants and/or audience members. Several participants/audience members also commented on, and expressed gratitude for, the societal benefit of participating in/attending public talks and workshops. The schools visits (to Woodhorn Museum, Northumberland), the teaching materials for which were directly informed by my research on Davy carried out during the period of the award, achieved an even greater degree of impact: all of the school groups participating in these activities were drawn from one of the UK's most economically deprived areas (as indicated by, for example, a high proportion of pupils being eligible for the Pupil Premium), and, from the feedback received from both teachers and pupils, the benefit, both educational and societal, derived from these visits is clearly in evidence. Several of the children who benefited from these activities had never visited a museum or gallery before; that many of the children living with the socioeconomic problems caused by the decline of industrial society have so obviously enjoyed and benefited from exploring their local industrial heritage is particularly pleasing. Many of the venues/institutions that hosted these events have benefited also, in raised public awareness of their programmes of activities, and in the increased footfall during such events. The impact achieved during the period of the award does not end here: a further institutional award (Impact and Knowledge Exchange Grant) is expanding the roll-out of talks and workshops (based on the successful Wordsworth Trust talk and workshop model), and the schools work is developing by means of a 'Letters and the Lamp' website and teaching materials pack for the use of Key Stage 2 teachers and pupils, to be offered to other mining/industrial museums in the UK alongside Woodhorn. This Impact and Knowledge Exchange work stems directly from the AHRC award; as such, the funding provided for 'A Man of Science and a Poet: Humphry Davy's Letters, Life, and Legacy' has not only enabled impact over the period of the award, but is also enabling it in the present, and will continue to enable it in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D6813915-30A3-45E5-A185-0DA34EB1E0FA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b39fb06d5e28.38246648</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>While Humphry Davy (1775-1829) remains one of the best known British chemists of the early nineteenth century, only c. 250 letters are currently in the public domain, and these are often given in part rather than in full. The Oxford University Press edition of Davy's collected letters, which this AHRC Leaders' Fellowship has enabled, will increase this fivefold: we have c. 1200 letters written by Davy that have been located and transcribed from archives around the world. The edition will be groundbreaking in a number of ways. To take just one example, there is an entirely unpublished collection of 53 letters from Davy to John Hodgson, who was the rector of the parish that included Felling Colliery where a terrible mining disaster killed 92 men and boys in 1812. This disaster, and Hodgson's published account of it, encouraged coal mine owners to contact Davy and ask whether he might be able to help. Davy's wire gauze miners' safety lamp, the Davy lamp, was the result of his investigations. Davy's letters from the period 1815-17 trace the development of his lamp; his innovations with the gauze that were inspired by wire workers in Kendal, and his continued experiments with the size of the apertures and the thickness of the wire. The letters also reveal his response to the accusations of plagiarism levelled at him by George Stephenson and William Reid Clanny by anonymous and pseudonymous letters written to the regional and national press. These letters are often intensely private and angry: close analysis of the manuscripts reveal crossings out and insertions over the line that demonstrate his precarious mental state. The letters also demonstrate the lengths to which he went to rubbish Stephenson's designs and crush his claim to priority. This is only one example of many, but given that the lamp is by far Davy's most famous invention, perhaps it is the most important. 

I would like to note here that I passed my Institute of Leadership and Management course (ILM) level 5 today (15/3/17) as promised in my proposal for the fellowship. (I didn't know where to register this on Research Fish.)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The letters currently exist (without notes) in a website (http://www.davy-letters.org.uk/) and I have had numerous academics contact me to say that they have used them in publications (articles, essays and books). The letters have also been used in this way by the co-editors, Advisory Editors, and Research Assistant on the Davy Letters project. The final event of the AHRC Leaders Fellowship is the 'Using the Davy Letters' Symposium, to be held at the Royal Institution in April 2017. I am hopeful that the papers from this will be published in a special edition of the journal Ambix (Journal of the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry). The Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) which is currently being filmed and put together will run in October 2017 for the first time; this makes use of selected letters and the research that has gone into the annotation of these letters. 
I always intended for the AHRC Leaders Fellowship to be a step to the next, big project. The Royal Institution holds c. 50 notebooks of Humphry Davy. I have been given teaching relief for the summer term of 2017-2018 to write a research bid that would collaborate with the Royal Institution in the transcription and annotation of these notebooks. The work on the letters when completed will allow us to properly date the entries in these notebooks, which include the poetry, chemical experiments, travel writings, geological surveys, illustrations, biographical information, philosophical musings, and draft lecture notes of one of the most fascinating figures of the early nineteenth century.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C07F7B09-86ED-4840-8102-15FC2CB42396</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b39f6667a337.63845183</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.davy-letters.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C0772806-FCBA-4E5F-A2BE-A9B6DEFBCD2D</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Rethinking the Distribution of Cultural Capital in the &amp;quot;Safety Lamp Controversy&amp;quot;: Davy vs Stephenson in Letters to the Newcastle Press, 1816-17'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Literature and Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cb34232dafd05c16926b5898ef748261"><gtr:id>cb34232dafd05c16926b5898ef748261</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lacey, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b6de27e63dc9.98379712</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5318BBEB-8E99-4533-81FE-7E1E3D023B03</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Chemical Club: An Early Nineteenth-Century Scientific Dining Club.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ambix</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/72dee058a8eb5ccc9b0f1eedfec640ea"><gtr:id>72dee058a8eb5ccc9b0f1eedfec640ea</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lacey A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-6980</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d565ea543c6.78906493</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>79EFD6DE-95B7-43E0-A2E4-99FBCF84F7C4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Davy in 1816</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Wordsworth Circle</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d86c47e04c579f5ac75ce12a8e35ca49"><gtr:id>d86c47e04c579f5ac75ce12a8e35ca49</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ruston, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bedf6c41d042.19004556</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M011259/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
