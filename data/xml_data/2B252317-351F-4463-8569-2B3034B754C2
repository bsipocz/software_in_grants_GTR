Centre</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/M018040/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The vision for Edinburgh's Centre for Mammalian Synthetic Biology (SynthSys-Mammalian) is to pioneer the development of the underpinning tools and technologies needed to implement engineering principles and realise the full potential of synthetic biology in mammalian systems. We have an ambitious plan to build in-house expertise in cell engineering tool generation, whole-cell modelling, computer-assisted design and construction of DNA and high-throughput phenotyping to enable synthetic biology in mammalian systems for multiple applications. In this way we will not only advance basic understanding of mammalian biology but also generate tools and technologies for near-term commercial exploitation in areas such as the pharmaceutical and drug testing industries, biosensing cell lines sensing disease biomarkers for diagnositics, novel therapeutics, production of protein based drugs e.g. antibodies and also programming stem cell development and differentiation for regenerative medicine applications. In parallel we will develop and implement new understanding of the social and economic impact of this far-reaching technology to ensure its benefits to society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Synthetic biology (SB) is defined in the UK Synthetic Biology Roadmap1 as 'the design and engineering of biologically based parts, novel devices and systems as well as the re-design of existing natural biological systems.' SB is both a platform technology and a translational technology (providing the link between a wide range of underpinning disciplines - ranging from biochemistry to systems biology - and practical applications in a wide range of different market sectors). We aim to pioneer the development of the underpinning tools and technologies needed to implement engineering principles and realise the full potential of synthetic biology in mammalian systems. We will 1. Establish a robust pipeline for the production and screening of synthetic transcription factors (sTFs) and synthetic chromatin editors (sCEs) based on the DNA binding domains of TAL effectors (TALEs) and the CRISPR/Cas system fused to transcriptional activators, repressors or chromatin modifiers e.g. histone deacetylases. 2. Create an in silico tool for designing small-molecule control of engineered protein and demonstrate the utility of this tool by producing novel drug-controlled proteins. 3. Assemble synthetic chromosomes and chromosomal safe harbors for introduction of synthetic genetic circuits. 4. Reduce contextual effects by building predictive models through characterizing circuit-chassis interactions at the single-cell level. 5.Engineer memory and computation synthetic genetic circuits in mammalian cells to a) deliver mechanistic information on the cell state, and responses to perturbations, e.g. drug treatments and count cell divisions. Underpinning this will be the development of standards for mammalian synthetic biology in collaboration with our partners NPL and take the concept of RRI in new directions to include: the politics of standardisation; the use of strategic mapping methodologies; and new approaches to engagement informed by speculative design.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The SBRC focuses on building mammalian engineering capacity to benefit the life sciences, biotechnology and biomedicine.

Our deliverables for engaging with stakeholders are:

1) Through community building we will increase membership of the SBRC and double our total collaborative research income by Year 5. We will reach out locally by continuing Open Centre Meetings (fortnightly), organise monthly PI lunches preceded by a PI seminar, record seminars and both live webcast and disseminate online, hold an annual Away Day, publish a monthly newsletter, and further explore novel ways of engagement.

2) To be an internationally recognised brand with a reputation as a centre of excellence in synthetic bioengineering of mammalian systems. To do so, we will strengthen links to local networks for national phenotyping and regenerative medicine, champion the iGEM competition, continue to be active participants in three RCUK networks, link with other SBRCs and DNA Synthesis Centres, build additional international links (particularly in China, Korea, and Hong Kong), and work to host the meeting for the international synthetic yeast genome project and SynBioBeta.

3) By Year 5, we will have created an innovation environment for synthetic biology that balances the objectives and concerns of public, industry, policy, and academic communities. We will set up a Stakeholder Forum with members from industry, policy makers, regulators, and investors; maintain high visibility at Science Festivals; deepen our involvement in art-in-science events; host a writer in residence to help communicate our research; continue to make best use of the University's Press Gangs and Officers; maintain a dynamic suite of websites, have a Twitter account, and all researchers will create and promote &amp;quot;Research in a Nutshell&amp;quot; BioPodcasts; arrange 6-monthly, off-site, SynthSys Cafes to foster engagement and build dialogue; raise the profile of our activity across government through invitations to MSPs, Chief Scientists and NGOs; and maintain and grow international influence through our membership of government leadership committees. We will create a community of activity around the SBRC with at least two industrial SBRC members participating in training activities and in reciprocal secondment of staff.

A further key impact will be to generate highly skilled, responsible, and enthusiastic scientists and engineers that will move into research, management, or operational roles in private and public sectors, building the UK's capacity in synthetic biology.

We anticipate the generation of considerable intellectual property (IP) of commercial value. We will draw on Edinburgh Research and Innovation Business Development Executive, our International Advisory Board, our industrial partners, and the strength of our broader industrial network to expedite the translation of IP. We are a key partner of the Synthetic Biology Innovation Commercial and Industrial Translation Engine (SynbiCITE) and are heavily involved in both the Scottish Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre and the CENSIS Innovation Centre in Sensor and Imaging Systems. We will target new market sectors by developing marketing materials tailored to specific industries, holding an annual Industry Information Day to consolidate and broaden our links, and by developing an industry-engagement plan to meet industry through site visits, missions overseas and industry partnering events. By year 5, we plan three innovations in early stages of product development and to be in advanced discussion with 3-4 industry partners around R&amp;amp;D collaborations.

Finally, in addition to academic impacts through refereed journals and presentations at international conferences, SBRC outputs will be published in industry and policy journals, talks at national and international festivals, in media presentations, and through a portfolio of policy briefing notes that are widely distributed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11379882</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibitor at SynBioBeta London 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D358D3EF-0CA6-4DEC-A3F9-D29EEDC55528</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Centre had a stand at SynBioBeta in London April 2016 alongside our other sister BBSRC funded SynBio Research Centres.

Staff and postgraduate students from SynthSys, and this year's Edinburgh iGEM team, came along to explain more about their research and the power of synthetic biology. They were joined by staff from the Centre for Regenerative Medicine, who explained how stem cells are being used to create cells suited for therapy. Children had an opportunity to engineer their own fuzzy felt bugs, parents contemplated stem cells under a microscope and visitors were amazed at the metal munching power of microbes. Many of our visitors were quite unaware of the work we do and its potential impact for society.

Over the course of the day we had 75 visitors come to explore about our multidisciplinary research that brings biology together with engineering. We had exhibits from the lab of Dr Timm Krueger who offered hands-on interactive on a novel method for sorting cells, useful potentially in medicine. The lab of Prof Chris French explained how cells can be engineered to detect arsenic in drinking water, a project that may help the 100 million people at risk in developing countries. Members from the lab of Dr Patrick Cai offered a fun demonstration of the value of high-throughput and automated technology for printing cells (see photos). Dr Louise Horsfall's lab treated guests to the wonders of fluorescent bacteria and how bugs can be designed to clean up contaminated soil. Finally, visitors could actually check for themselves how climate change impacts on plant growth by playing with parameters of a model generated in the lab of Professor Andrew Millar. Edinburgh Doors Open Day is organised by the Cockburn Association (Edinburgh's Civic Trust). Now in its 25th year, the event has become one of the capital's most popular free days out. For the day Edinburgh's most architecturally, culturally and socially significant buildings are opened to the public. Many of our visitors asked probing questions about our research and several were potential undergraduate students considering training in synthetic biology.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b938136d5c21.92090952</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.synthsys.ed.ac.uk/news/opening-doors-synthsys</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Midlothian Science Festival 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>947AE697-A177-4F84-A2C8-AB984DF8D62C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We took our 'Master Biobuilder' to he Midlothian Science Festival over a weekend in October.

We remain convinced that this is a relevant, exciting and ambitious area for synthetic biological engineering and one in which we can forge a unique position. The Centre was officially launched on October 7th at a day-long event attended by over 100 delegates from academia, industry and government/NGOs. Our Leadership and Management team has worked hard this year to raise the profile of our new Centre both in the UK and internationally. They have represented the Centre at numerous national and international research and industry conferences over the year, notably the Mammalian
Synthetic Biology workshop in Boston, Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution &amp;amp; Design (SEED) in Boston, Innovate UK, SynBioBeta in London and San Francisco (including a UKTI Trade Mission), a workshop at the National University of Singapore, and at Biomanufacturing Sheffield.
Despite some challenges in hiring suitably qualified staff in a timely manner, our research programme and spend is largely on schedule. We have made good progress in Work Theme 1 around tools development, with success in generating libraries of synthetic transcription factors and with developing 'drugable' protein modules. Although still early for substantive research outputs, we are encouraged at our first publication (on automation of DNA synthesis) and several others in preparation. Research activity and outputs will accelerate over the coming year.
Our first patent - of a rapid and cheap method for the production of synthetic transcription factors, the so-called STAR method - is filed and currently under licensing negotiations. One commercial collaboration (with IDT) for a multiplexing technology is under discussion.
We have proactively engaged industry through attending and exhibiting at conferences and site visits. The activities of the Centre are very interesting to industry: Over the past year, we have hosted visits from 16 companies that we had not previously engaged with and we will continue dialogue with them towards building collaborations for the future. One area not in the original Case for Support, but nevertheless of keen industry interest, was the application of the synthetic biology tools for bioproduction (e.g. biologics in CHO cells); we will incorporate this into the Centre research activities as a parallel work stream seeking funding from alternative sources (e.g. IB Catalyst, private funding).
Over the year we engaged with policy and strategy in synthetic biology development: The management team and PIs participated in the Synthetic Biology Roadmap Consultation (Birmingham, June); Professor Joyce Tait is active on the Synthetic Biology Leadership Council and had significant involvement in the drafting of the Strategic Plan for Synthetic Biology (Roadmap Refresh) and she is appointed to the US NAS Advisory Committee on 'Reprogramming Non-human Populations using &amp;quot;Gene Drives&amp;quot;: Recommendations for Responsible Conduct.'
The creation of the Centre has drawn much attention both internally and externally, which has stimulated both new conversations and working collaborations: Professor Rosser is leading on a full application for a &amp;pound;5M BBSRC sLoLa award with five other PIs from across the University (two not on the original Centre grant); She is a Co-I on a &amp;pound;3M Innovate UK grant with the University of York; and Centre PIs have been awarded ~&amp;pound;200K of internal funds to kick-start several new projects.
We are keen to support growth of the synthetic biology community outside of the South East of the UK and hosted the first SynBioBeta Activate! Event in Scotland, drawing a sell-outcrowd of &amp;gt;100 academic and industry delegates. Regular engagement with SynbiCITE, through participation in events such as LEAN Launchpad, 4-Day MBA and other organised events, keeps us integrated with the wider UK community.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F0F81FEA-E36F-4B87-AF40-1537846410C3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56dc2e45c43481.05670965</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The vision for the UK Centre for Mammalian Synthetic Biology (the 'Centre') at the University of Edinburgh is to pioneer the development of the essential tools and technologies needed to realize the full potential of synthetic biology for mammalian cell biology and human medicine.

The sequences here are obtained by identifying the protein chain that interacts with a ligand for a given Guide to PHARMACOLOGY interaction, determining the binding residues, and producing a continuous 'bind sequence' that can be used to confer drugability to another protein.

Each bind sequence also contains metrics such as atomic contact ratio and proportional length, and visualisations such as the residue distance matrix, to allow you to better judge whether a sequence is likely to be able to fold independently.

The rationale for such a project was to enable the development of orthogonal molecular switches - switches which only respond to an exogenous molecular trigger, which itself will not interfere with endogenous receptors.</gtr:description><gtr:id>58446242-2865-476E-AABE-5A9FC9DE3BAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Text written March 2017: We have used the tool to generate druggable versions of Cas9 and cpf1 for inducible gene editing (paper in preparation).
