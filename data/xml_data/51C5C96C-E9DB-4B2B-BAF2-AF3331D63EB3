Recently, large increases in surface temperature and ice melt have been recorded at many locations in the Arctic Ocean and Greenland, while Antarctica has seen cooling with increase in ice volume at some locations and decrease at others. 

Understanding the reasons behind this asymmetric inter-hemispheric trend lies in understanding the ocean circulation patterns.

The possibility of sudden catastrophic polar ice loss has raised fears over its potential impact on altering Europe's moderate climate in addition to threatening its coastlines due to global sea level rise. There is still insufficient knowledge about the pathways and mechanisms by which heat and carbon are transferred between atmosphere and ocean interior, and between polar regions and the rest of the globe. Progress in our understanding has been hindered by our lack of full grasp of ocean turbulence. 

Furthermore, the increase in ocean temperature and the reduction in sea ice in the polar regions are likely to have significant impacts on the operation of the Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems, particularly for populations of fish, krill and penguins. Understanding the mechanisms that cause heat, carbon and nutrients to be mixed both laterally and vertically in polar oceans is vital to interpreting the regional physical, chemical and biological changes that are occurring. Mixing if facilitated by turbulence generated by winds and eddies in the upper ocean as well as tides in the abyssal ocean, among other factors. Turbulent mixing mixes tracers (such as heat and carbon) in the ocean just like stirring mixes heavy cream in a coffee cup. 

The key project objectives are therefore:
1. To quantify, describe and understand the spatial and time-varying patterns of lateral turbulent mixing in the Southern Ocean and vertical mixing over the global ocean.
2. To employ our findings to reconstruct more accurate ocean circulation patterns by using a combination of observational data and state of art climate models,
3. To employ the climate models to study the climate variability over the next decades to centuries and to evaluate its impact on regional climate.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>NERC:
The fellow will engage actively throughout the course of the project with the NERC programs SoFine, DynOPO, and DIMES. The fellow will work closely with associated scientists in assimilating their inferred estimates of mixing into a smooth global map. The resulting maps will be implemented in U-of-Reading based Aquaplanet model and UKESM model (more specifically its ocean component NEMO) and then made available to the modelling efforts at UK institutions, and with a 2-year delay, to the international oceanographic community. 

Societal impacts:
The applicant envisage setting up a webpage for the project aimed at secondary-age science children, that will allow them to study the centennial to millennial variability in the polar climate based on changes in the ocean MOC . The webpage will include explanations of the purpose of the project and links to pages explaining the rationale behind Physics at Oxford (AOPP) science. The webpage resources will be backed up by a number of personal visits by the fellow to local schools and schools in Cambridge, who will undertake a number of marine-related demonstrations to engage with pupils. Two possible examples of the types of activities that could easily be demonstrated would be simple tank density experiments (using salt water and food dye) and a career talk explaining what it is like to be a researcher within Physics at Oxford. In consultation with local teachers and the scientific staff at Physics at Oxford and the GK Batchelor laboratory at DAMTP, the fellow will try to arrange for visits by students to the lab to gain first hand experience of laboratory fluid flows which simulate ocean and atmosphere circulation. At Oxford, the applicant will engage with experimental and numerical demonstrations to students, will help at Open Days in the Department and will work with the Physics Department's Outreach team. Activities in Cambridge will be conducted during fellow's visit to Cambridge for scientific collaborations and so do not require additional funding.

In addition, the fellow will try to build upon his experience at MIT and investigate the possibility of acquiring funding for purchasing an Earth prototype (named the iGlobe) to give students a 3D experience of geophysical flows on Earth, providing them with touchpad control over ocean and atmosphere dynamics. This will require building a partnership between Oxford and iGlobe Inc. Through the fellow's involvement with iGlobe as a part of an outreach program at MIT, iGlobe representatives have expressed interest in forming such a partnership.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>526515</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P018319/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C29F371D-A988-48F8-BFF5-1657DAB1176F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean - Atmosphere Interact.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>723BA0F8-3ECD-4E2A-A39E-44936EAC1517</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean Circulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
