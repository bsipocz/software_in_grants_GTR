This interdisciplinary project focuses on the interplay of spatial and socio-economic transformations and their consequences for people's experiences of urban neighbourhoods and access to public services. It examines how urbanisation together with in-migration and social re-stratification, are remaking urban neighbourhoods and Chinese urban dwellers' day-to-day lives. 

The project brings together 16 UK and Chinese specialists in urban development, planning, housing, public policy and China studies. This enables the team to draw on UK and European research on urbanisation, planning, neighbourhoods and deprivation, and public service provision to theoretically and conceptually inform understandings of the processes underway in China and policy recommendations.

The project has four distinct work packages: in Work Package 1 the team will use quantitative data and spatial analytics to identify the precise characteristics of socio-spatial change in three Chinese cities. Work Package 2, which will run alongside Work Package 1, involves analysing land use planning and policies that have guided change in the three cities in the last fifteen years. These findings will then help to inform the selection of neighbourhoods with different social-economic profiles and migrant-local compositions for case study research in Work Package 3. The team will conduct in-depth analysis of residents' experiences of urbanisation, paying particular attention to social stratification and access to jobs, education, health care, and housing. Here we aim to understand how urbanites form and re-form socio-economic networks, access services and negotiate the changing physical landscape to satisfy their daily needs. These findings will in turn allow the team to work towards an integrative analysis in Work Package 4. Here the focus will be on making contributions to both theory and practice. We aim to re-conceptualise 'neighbourhood' and contribute to theory on neighbourhood transformations under urbanisation, industrialisation and de-industrialisation. Just as importantly we also aim to make recommendations that will enable Chinese policy makers and urban planners to better provide public services for all in cities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There will be seven groups of non-academic beneficiaries of the research:
Within China:
1. Practitioners and policy-makers in urban planning in China (e.g. Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Development; Ministry of Land and Resources, National Development and Reform Commission, where team has strong contacts).
2. City Governments, especially their Urban Planning Bureaux, in Tianjin, Hangzhou and Chengdu, as well as other regional centres in China
3. Urban residents, especially marginalised groups, considering their access to housing and public services.
UK and International Beneficiaries:
4. UK/Scottish Government and EU policy makers working on bilateral projects or engaging more widely with China. These include UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK Departments for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and International Development (DfID), which now works closely with the World Bank in China.
5. Companies investing in Chinese markets, especially for property development projects.
6. International organizations actively involved in supporting and evaluating China's urbanisation such as the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), particularly their Beijing offices; United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) and WHO offices in Geneva.
7. NGOs (charities and other third sector organizations) working to find ways to reduce unfairness in access to public services as well as to meet specific needs of marginalised groups, for example of women, in developing countries.

Our research will benefit these users in the following ways:
1. Deepening and transforming understanding by scholars, practitioners and policy makers of patterns of spatial and social transformation in urban China. Our project has the potential to shape urbanisation debates and policies through its insights on the relationships between spatial and social change under urbanisation and to influence the course of international development.
2. Improving information for policy-makers and their domestic and international advisers in their current attempts to achieve the Chinese government's stated goals of providing basic public services for all, and improving access. Our survey evidence on people's experiences of their neighbourhoods and access to services, as well as other socio-economic factors will inform public policy along many dimensions. It may help mobilize political support for improving public services. Survey and qualitative data findings, and the insights gained through their detailed analysis have the capacity to influence policy agendas, change perceptions and attitudes, and influence the way issues are defined and framed and the values which are perceived to be at stake in China's urbanisation.
3. Contributing to understanding of China and Chinese people's experiences by UK government (FCO, BIS, DfID) and EU policy makers, as well as wider civil society.
4. Contribute to the UK economy by enhancing businesses' understanding of China's markets for housing, health, education and other services. The opportunities in China for investment (by UK and EU firms) are growing and our project will produce valuable new information on urban residents' socio-spatial distribution as well as service needs.
5. Helping development NGOs and international governmental organizations active in China and other developing countries to identify strategic priorities in the process of China's urbanisation and understand the context of public service delivery in different types of neighbourhoods.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>606945</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</gtr:description><gtr:id>1BA24F5A-7582-4862-A07F-1D5B7C76F4C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs yet.

The Glasgow and Nankai teams worked very closely together to implement the proposed research plan. The work in the year started with a whole team meeting from the 4th to the 8th of January 2016 at Nankai University. At this meeting implementation details of the proposed research packages were discussed; joint groups for each package were set up; potential opportunities and challenges were also discussed. The meeting made all team members familiar with the overall research objectives and requirements. The two and half day team meeting was followed by initial fieldworks in Tianjin. Both Nankai and Glasgow team members visited various neighbourhoods and housing estates in the city. Following the meeting, Nankai colleagues started the data collection process, and Glasgow colleagues began the process of international literature gathering and reviewing. 

During the year, several Glasgow team members visited Tianjin, Chengdu and Hangzhou to conduct fieldwork and also discuss issues emerged at Nankai during the data collection work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c16538819ac7.36554855-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Glasgow team played a leading role in academic direction and research design.

The project involves in the collection of following data:

1) GIS maps for neighbourhood areas in Tianjin, based on commercial GPS maps, manually checked with Google Map and Baidu Map.
 
2) Bought Commercial GPS maps for Chengdu and Hangzhou (with neighbourhood area and other public service attributes) 

3) Housing estate database in Excel/SPSS format (estate architecture, design and housing price data), caught/downloaded from property websites for Tianjin, Chengdu and Hangzhou (further validating and checking required before analysis). 

4) Digital satellite image maps for land uses in the three case study cities.
 
All above databases are constructed mainly by the Nankai Team in consultation with Glasgow team. Once cleared, they will be shared by the research team members for analysis. 

A neighbourhood questionnaire is designed to collect more social and economic data for a sample of neighbourhoods in each city. 

A household survey questionnaire is designed to collect household data in a series of samples of neighbourhoods. The survey work is planned for 2017. Once completed, a data base with 5000 households will be available for analysis, about the social divisions and classes in these cities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9B4B4D61-47CF-449A-BB4C-A0563DF24A63</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Benefited from the large research team and resources, this could be the most comprehensive and relatively large scale data collection and analysis at neighbourhood area level.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c1938cac4f90.76642419</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Data Base for Neighbourhoods</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Big Data Approach for Spatial Analysis:

According to the original proposal, the first year work was on spatial and planning data collection, aiming to establish the distribution patterns of neighbourhoods in case study cities, and address the question: what kind of neighbourhoods could be found in cities and where do they located? The challenge as we soon realised was that there was no ready made official spatial and socio-economic data available, especially at small neighbourhood/estate (xiaoqu) level. After few months exploring and investigation, we decided to build special spatial and socio-economic database for this study. For spatial GIS data, Nankai colleagues bought GPS maps from a commercial provider for the three case study cities and worked on them, in comparison with Google Map, to identify and mark neighbourhood areas. For socio-economic data at neighbourhood area level, a big data approach was used to capture housing market data from various websites. Both of these exercises were very complicated and labour intensive and Nankai team members spent a lot time and resources. For each city, it involved the identification of over 2000 neighbourhood areas.

Spatial Sample Belts:

Because the social and economic data captured from the internet does not have all the necessary attributes for neighbourhood analysis, we decided to divide spatial analysis into two levels: at the whole city level we use data captured from the internet; at a more accurate level of analysis, we chosen two 100 metre wide spatial sample belts in each city, intersecting at the city centre. In each city one belt runs east-west and the other one follows each city's main urban development axis. These belts can capture both the urban layout of the cities as well as its growth trajectory. For every neighbourhood located on these belts, we plan to carry out further investigation to collect essential socio-economic data. We have designed a neighbourhood questionnaire to collect these data. These sample belts cover about 100 to 200 neighbourhoods in each city. Both the choose of the belts and the questionnaire design were a collective endeavour that discussed in several team meetings.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D7C8586E-1444-4833-A846-20E4A7CFFB45</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data availability at local neighbourhood level is a main problem in China. Most other researchers carried out analysis at the Jiedao Level (Street Committee, a level of local government which covers a relatively large territory). Our methods allow us to carry out spatial and social analysis at the neighbourhood level. The neighbourhood checking and marking exercise however is very time consuming according to the works we have done in Tianjin. For the other two cities we may need to use a slightly simple methods, including contracting out data supplementation to website data service agencies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c184c51882a2.43983334</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Spatial Data on Neighbourhoods</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>56890953-4898-4BCA-AF85-05A86A6A258C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spatial Segregation Measures: A Methodological Review</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b9e40aef917883d46f8875b86d9b5f0d"><gtr:id>b9e40aef917883d46f8875b86d9b5f0d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yao J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a96e2eac8bf00.80370014</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D8678F82-69E1-476A-838A-DE2720A54306</gtr:id><gtr:title>(De-)Activating the growth machine for redevelopment: The case of Liede urban village in Guangzhou</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Urban Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2585257962f19c804855e5920219ec8c"><gtr:id>2585257962f19c804855e5920219ec8c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guo Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a6618fa4cd628.48105683</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N010981/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A2961412-FA64-4331-A882-DA219AC99567</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social policy and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BBFA0D5-A9F8-43BE-A2A4-2C369538B45F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stratification</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4E9565D3-0753-4FDB-9DCF-1CFF2C985313</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urbanisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
