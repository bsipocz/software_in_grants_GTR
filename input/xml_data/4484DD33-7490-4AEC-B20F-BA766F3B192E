For each of these problems there is a pill, sometimes even several pills. These medicines have all been shown to be beneficial in clinical trials and current best medical practice often dictates that a single patient with multiple medical conditions should be co-prescribed several different medicines. However, reality is often not as simple as the clinical trials. In clinical trials patients are often excluded if they are too old, have more than one health problem or take other medications. In real life, patients tend to be elderly and often have many different illnesses requiring a cocktail of medications to treat them. 

One way in which taking several simultaneous medications might be harmful is when some of these medications interact with each other. One can block the beneficial effect of the other or they can combine to cause a harmful side effect. These interactions often cannot be detected by clinical trials either because they specifically excluded patients already taking other medications or just because they don't have sufficient numbers to detect an effect. Instead, they are either picked up by anecdotal case reporting by doctors to drug authorities or they are predicted on theoretical grounds only. Usually, these sources of information cannot give any detail on how commonly these interactions occur in real life and how severe they are.

In recent years, computerised medical records have provided the opportunity to collect large databases of patient records that can be used in research. These large databases contain many more patients than could be recruited in a typical clinical trial and so they are particularly suited to study rare outcomes such as adverse drug effects.

I intend to use a large database of GP records to study how much harm drug interactions actually cause in patients who have been prescribed a drug pair that potentially interacts. I will start by finding out how frequently drugs that are said to interact with each other are prescribed together and which combinations are most frequent. I will then choose three drug pairs that are frequently prescribed together and are said to interact and cause a potentially serious harmful outcome. For each of these I will compare the risk of this outcome in patients who received the drug pair with those who received only one of the pair. This should show whether the drug interaction actually occurs and how likely it is to occur if the relevant drug pair is prescribed. I will use this to compare the risks and benefits of this drug combination.

This information will be useful in many ways. Firstly, the research on specific drug interactions will be useful to doctors to decide on whether they should prescribe the drugs together or avoid them. Secondly, by looking at a few commonly prescribed drug interactions I will be able to provide an insight into how big a problem drug interactions are in medicine. Finally, I will apply epidemiological research methods to an understudied area and highlight the scope for further work in the area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Modern medicine is characterised by an increasing trend towards polypharmacy, the prescription of multiple concurrent medicines to an individual. However, polypharmacy has been associated with worsening health outcomes in recent research. It is possible that this excess harm is due to an increase in the risk of drug interactions. These are not well studied in clinical trials which are underpowered for rare outcomes and are usually conducted in younger, fitter patients than those who are prescribed the drugs in real life.

I aim to investigate the population level impact of drug interactions in primary care. My objectives are:

1. To describe the prescription pattern of pairs of drugs with a potentially serious interaction
2. For three frequently co-prescribed drug pairs where a potentially serious interaction has been described, to quantitatively estimate the effect of this interaction
3. To directly or indirectly measure the reduction in the intended beneficial drug effects due to an interaction

I will use the CPRD, a large database of primary care electronic health records, to conduct this research. I will use cross-sectional studies conducted at several time points to achieve the first objective. For the remaining objectives, I will use cohort and case only methods to conduct this research. The latter benefit from being inherently resistant to time invariant confounding. I will also use a variety of other techniques to try and reduce the possibility for confounding including propensity scoring, sensitivity analysis and negative control studies.

Medical benefits of this work include providing quantitative data on commonly prescribed drug pairs that is valuable information at the point of prescription. Scientific benefits include providing empirical estimates of the effects of drug interactions that are often only predicted on theoretical grounds and also pioneering new techniques, such as the case only methods, in the study of drug interactions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Direct beneficiaries

There are several groups that will directly benefit from my research:

1. Clinicians and patients - quantitative estimates of the effect of drug interactions are directly relevant to prescribing decisions. Having better information on the harms and benefits of drug combinations will affect whether they should be prescribed. This will benefit clinicians by allowing them to make more informed prescribing decisions and ultimately will improve patient outcomes.

2. Drugs Regulators - this research will also be directly relevant to the drugs regulators. The work on how frequently drugs with potentially serious interactions are prescribed will help prioritise work on improving prescribing practice. Additionally, quantitative estimates of the harm associated with drug interactions should be directly relevant to the regulation of those drugs, perhaps informing the mandatory summary of product characteristics leaflet.

3. Academics - direct benefits to the academic community are also clear. The work on prescribing patterns will inform future work on drug interactions, perhaps uncovering future research targets. The work on new methods will have an impact on the range of methods that are available for future research in the field.

Indirect/Longer term beneficiaries

1. Public health - by informing prescribing decisions it is anticipated that this work will have an impact on patient morbidity and mortality attributable to prescription medicines and therefore reduce the harm done inadvertently by the medical profession.

2. Pharmaceutical Industry - this work is relevant to the pharmaceutical industry as they are tasked with compiling information on drug interactions for all medicines that they sell. In addition it might be relevant in identifying the clinical relevance of theoretical interactions.

3. Healthcare Technology Industry - clinical systems that support electronic prescribing are an ideal vehicle to improve prescribing. Many primary care prescribing systems include automated alerts that notify the prescriber of potential drug adverse effects and interactions. However, these systems can present the prescriber with a shopping list of warnings that can be overwhelming. Quantifying the clinical impact of drug interactions should allow warnings to be prioritised and in some cases tailored to the patient where only certain patients might be at risk.

4. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - my research will be relevant to future guideline development. Guidelines will increasingly need to address the fact that most patients have more than one disease and are taking a variety of medications. My work will help inform future guidelines by highlighting which existing drugs should be checked for when initiating treatment and whether the potential benefits outweigh the harms.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>233858</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D6DB2DFD-927F-44A2-A065-B93C0E9A6DA5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oral Fluoroquinolone Use and Retinal Detachment.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>JAMA ophthalmology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dcb05cf77e5fc2081789614f1c91c026"><gtr:id>dcb05cf77e5fc2081789614f1c91c026</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Douglas IJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2168-6165</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b56d08e33fc9.52848389</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D3EE410D-4892-49DD-A46D-5203573FDB50</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cardiovascular outcomes associated with use of clarithromycin: population based study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ (Clinical research ed.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/56a18ff69bed042292b5ab38b5bafea2"><gtr:id>56a18ff69bed042292b5ab38b5bafea2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wong AY</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0959-535X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56be074dc56e86.19475627</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3B5458B9-BEA0-4215-8B7B-B2B439D9A543</gtr:id><gtr:title>Association between oral fluoroquinolones and seizures: A self-controlled case series study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neurology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c5ca755d62daf9b888b2d8855a7b2df6"><gtr:id>c5ca755d62daf9b888b2d8855a7b2df6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chui CS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-3878</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b56d08908db8.04068483</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>87D72DC9-389D-4996-9378-07DE64E912CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evaluation of the risk of cardiovascular events with clarithromycin using both propensity score and self-controlled study designs.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British journal of clinical pharmacology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/34d5e471b7205d01395a0714811445bc"><gtr:id>34d5e471b7205d01395a0714811445bc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Root AA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0306-5251</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d3901357557.36647452</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CC53E027-18DE-4BB4-A2BD-78929DBFBAFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparative effectiveness of fourth-line anti-hypertensive agents in resistant hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European journal of preventive cardiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/02f611de01f3eae9244b905bfe36189a"><gtr:id>02f611de01f3eae9244b905bfe36189a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sinnott SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2047-4873</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b56d08b3cee0.45341058</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M014649/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>90487A08-C473-4CEB-B6D9-011A74AD06CF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.4  Research design and methodologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
