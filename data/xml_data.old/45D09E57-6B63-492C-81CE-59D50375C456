Methods to selectively form one enantiomer over the other are vital for the synthesis of fine chemicals and materials. Nowhere is the importance of such methods more apparent than in medicines: the infamous thalidomide tragedy came about due to the drug being administered as a mixture of enantiomers, one of which had the desired sedative effect while the other acted as a teratogen. Of particular value are catalytic methods for forming molecules as a single enantiomer, since the catalyst can be used many times, minimizing the cost and environmental impact of the chemical reaction.

This project seeks to develop an entirely new type of catalyst for enantio-selective synthesis - 'axonium ions'. These catalysts bear a positive charge, and are designed to catalyze reactions involving negatively charged substrates - a mode-of-action known as 'phase-transfer catalysis'. All current catalysts use hydrogen bonding as the 'glue' holding together the positive catalyst and negative substate: axonium ions will use previously unexploited anion-pi interactions. Here, the negative charge of the substrate forms a bond with an electron-deficient pi system. Since this is distinct from all known phase-transfer catalysts, it will significantly expand on the scope of these reactions. 

The synthesis of axonium catalysts is much shorter than that of the current state-of-the-art phase-transfer catalyst, so their use provides an environmentally and economically appealing method for the synthesis of complex molecules as a single enantiomer. The unique structure and interactions of axonium salts also lend them to a range of other applications including use as chemical sensors, photocatalysts and medicines for conditions including cystic fibrosis, areas which we will explore as part of this ongoing research programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economic impact - this project seeks to develop a novel catalytic process for the synthesis of complex chiral molecules. As such, it will be valuable to those reliant on such processes, including the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The reactions are catalytic, and are carried out under mild conditions, significantly reducing manufacturing costs. By reducing the cost of producing pharmaceutical intermediates there is also an opportunity to reduce the cost of medicines, directly improving the quality of life of those reliant on these therapeutics. 

Societal impact - in addition to the societal impact of the reduction in medicine costs outlined above, the development of this new methodology provides an opportunity to engage a wider audience in cutting-edge chemical research; we will seek to share our research through social media, and to generate content (such as blogs, podcasts etc.) accessible to the lay-person. This is vital to justify the use of tax-payer resources to fund the research, and has the potential to inspire the next generation of young people to become passionate about chemistry and the physical sciences.

Academic impact - a researcher will be trained in advanced techniques and management skills as a PDRA, preparing them for a further career within or outside chemistry. Such skilled personnel are valued by employers, and their expertise will help drive projects forward and generate economic wealth for years to come. The understanding gained through this study will be of interest to researchers in other areas including synthetic, computational and analytical chemistry, chemical biology and photophysics. This impact will be achieved by publication of results in international, high-impact journals, and through presentation at leading conferences.

Personal impact - gaining this grant will be a springboard for the PI, giving his growing research group the vital early support that will allow his career to flourish, and lead to the training of many more students and PDRAs in the future. The results gained in forming and testing a first generation of axonium catalyst will provide the basis for future funding applications with the EPSRC and elsewhere, and open the door to collaborations with researchers including those mentioned above (under Academic impact), as well as those outside academia in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99122</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R021481/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>41B6965D-D659-4099-9434-7C61B7E5BEF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asymmetric Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
