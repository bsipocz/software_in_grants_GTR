Many thousands, however, are not and have severe symptoms almost constantly, making their lives a misery. These patients may eventually develop blockage of the airways, which seems not to respond very well to current anti-asthma medicines. This blockage is thought to be caused, at least partly, by irreversible scarring of the airways caused by the inflammation, and other changes which cannot be reversed by current anti-asthma medicines. Very little is known about what causes these changes, but recent evidence implicates a new family of proteins released in the inflamed airways of asthmatics with the unusual name of FIZZ. In this study we plan to investigate the role of one of these proteins, FIZZ-2, in bringing about irreversible blockage in the airways of asthmatics. If FIZZ is found to be important, this will provide the impetus to develop new drugs for asthma which block the action of FIZZ, and therefore irreversible blockage of the airways: a totally new approach to asthma treatment for the benefit of chronic sufferers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Structural changes in the airways (collectively termed ?remodelling?), may be at least partly responsible for the accelerated decline in lung function and therapy-resistant airways obstruction seen in a proportion of patients with severe asthma. In this study we will evaluate the role in airways remodelling of the novel protein FIZZ-2/RELM-beta, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several airways remodelling changes in murine studies, and which is induced by pro-fibrotic cytokines such as IL-13, using a parallel approach in human asthmatics and a murine model of chronic allergen exposure using FIZZ-2/RELM-beta gene deleted Balb/C mouse strain. To implicate FIZZ-2/RELM-beta in airways remodelling in human asthma, we will (1) correlate its expression with airways hyperresponsiveness, airways obstruction and reversibility of airways obstruction in a group of asthmatics and controls; (2) compare its expression, at the level of mRNA and protein, with that of established markers of remodelling including goblet cell hyperplasia (Muc-5AC+ cells), expression of IL-13/TGF-beta, neovascularisation (numbers of CD31+ endothelial cells and VEGF expression), fibroblast infiltration and differentiation to myofibroblasts (expression of alpha-actin and collagen type I) and lay down of collagen I/III/V, fibronectin and tenascin; (3) study the effects of pro-fibrotic cytokines such as IL-13 on FIZZ-2/RELM-beta expression by cultured primary human bronchial epithelial cells and a cell line in vitro; (4) study the effects of FIZZ-2/RELM-beta on promoting differentiation of human fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in vitro. In parallel, in the murine model, we will sensitise and chronically challenge FIZZ-2/RELM-beta -/- mice and their wild type litter mates with allergen and measure changes in lung function, as well as features of remodelling (lung-derived fibroblast lines: myofibroblast differentiation and production of fibrous proteins; lung sections: inflammatory cellular infiltration, mucous hyperplasia and smooth muscle proliferation; lung homogenates: concentrations of fibrosis-relevant cytokines and fibrous proteins; BAL fluid: cytokines and cellular infiltration). Using these tools will enable us to evaluate the contribution of individual remodelling changes to airways obstruction and irreversibility of airways obstruction in human asthma, the functional role of FIZZ-2/RELM-beta in bringing about these changes, and how far the effects of other remodelling cytokines are dependent on its presence.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>343081</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>presentation at AAAAI 2008, 2009, USA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>65B29085-8578-499E-BC09-86D6513F129C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our data have been presented as a poster at American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp;amp; Immunology (AAAAI, Philadelphia 2008)

In 2 to 3 weeks, the primary cultures of the fibroblasts, which reached about 80% of confluence, were passaged into new flasks by using the typical trypsinization protocol. 6) For feeding of secondary culture, DMEM with 10% FCS was used. The cells were assessed microscopically to have fibroblast-like morphology. 7)Additionally, the level of expression of o~-smooth muscle actin was checked by means of cyto-immunologic staining. 8) In all cell lines, less than 5% of cells were stained. This was considered as proof that the isolated cell lines were not smooth muscle cells but fibroblasts. 9) The experiments were done on cells after 2 to 6 passages.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6499EA6A-8F99-43F2-8E38-413420B87534</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Using such methods, we have set up a cell bank for human airways primary fibroblast cells from asthmatics and normals.

Briefly, 8-10 brushings of grossly normal bronchial mucosa are obtained from each subject and removed from the brush by vortexing in HBSS buffer. The cells are brought to the laboratory in pre-cooled HBSS-10% FBS and incubated with DNase (50 g/ml) to eliminate clumping. After a wash with serum-free HBSS medium, the cells are resuspended in Airway Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (PromoCell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) and plated on FN-V-BSA (human fibronectin-Vitrogen 100-BSA)-coated 24 well culture dishes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells are allowed to attach to the plates for 4 days then fresh media added periodically until the monolayers in the wells are confluent (see additional figure below). At this time, the cultured bronchial epithelial cells show typical features of epithelium and more than 90% show positive cytokeratin immunoreactivity.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BD73AF49-4618-44B2-8C92-6B6F527A51E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Using such methods, we have set up a cell bank for human airways primary epithelial cells from asthmatics and normals.
