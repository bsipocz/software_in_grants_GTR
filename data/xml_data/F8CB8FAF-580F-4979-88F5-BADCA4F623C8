This role has resulted in the recent explosive growth in fields such as Mathematical and Systems Biology. This proposal is focused on continuing an existing programme of week-long MMSGs and shorter follow-up meetings designed to foster and stimulate new collaborations between the mathematical and biomedical sciences. The MMSGs allow mathematicians, statisticians, biomedical scientists and clinicians to come together under `one-roof' for a period of five days, and to participate in the application of mathematical modelling techniques to problems presented by the biomedical scientists. The workshops are focused, collaborative meetings where the mathematicians work side-by-side with the biomedical scientists to tackle their problem. The new ideas that are generated can help to direct future experimental work and developing new informative mathematical models and techniques. Shorter one day follow-up meetings (three per workshop) allow collaborations developed at the workshops to develop further. MMSGs have a nine year track record of facilitating exciting interdisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians, biomedical scientists and clinicians which have led to journal publications and future research being funded through MSc and PhD studentships, fellowships and larger grant applications. The programme provides an exciting opportunity for interdisciplinary research and an excellent training environment for students and early stage career researchers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31185</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborative partnership with NC3Rs</gtr:description><gtr:id>E27B2962-2516-4CF9-9E17-BEF48F255B7D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d163deb9d163f2-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>This MMSG series, along with its subsequent follow-up meetings, have developed a number of new and exciting interactions between mathematicians and life science researchers.

As detailed in the key findings section, the MMSG programme has developed a strong collaborative partnership with the NC3Rs that continues to this day. Members of the MMSG community have become strongly involved with NC3R activities focused on bringing further uses of mathematical modelling in to the 3Rs including the PI being invited to sit on the NC3Rs Studentship Panel and Co-Is involved in directing future MMSGs in collaboration with the NC3Rs.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>90000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>PhD studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>CA54EA73-8D4F-4418-8CDA-682CF6905665</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ede000a5ede001e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>90000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>PhD studentship - Mathematical Modelling of Wave Propagation in Heterogeneous Media</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Strathclyde</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>80965C0D-5421-4132-BDAE-8B5C91EC8F7F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ee36ad65ee36aea</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>997634</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Development of Zonated HFB for IVIVE of Systemic chemical Toxicity</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>65D8F2EA-EA6E-4E46-90BF-E4FA961D43AD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8901881527.9955806a3af20</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>3 month PDRA - Biomathematical modelling of Connexins in wound healing events, GCU Institute of Health</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>693A7672-C24C-47FF-85B2-5143DBB8B1EF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ede00be5ede00d2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>997634</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Development of Zonated HFB for IVIVE of Systemic chemical Toxicity</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C8F0236C-80D7-41E7-99A9-EEF3310D575D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ec929325ec92946</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research conducted at the MMSGs is nationally and internationally competitive. Much of the modelling work is of general interest to mathematicians working on systems and synthetic biology problems, as well as the stochastic modeling and computational modeling communities.



Of special interest is the clear impact on NC3R policy - as a result of interactions with the MMSG series of Study Groups, the PI, Co-Is and other members of the MMSG community, the NC3Rs have adopted mathematical modelling as a key strategy area for use in reducing, refining and replacing animals in experiments.

Beneficiaries: National Centre for the Refinement, Reduction and Replacement of Animals in experimentation

Contribution Method: The research grant allowed connections to be made with the NC3Rs. The importance of mathematical modelling in elucidating understanding of biological and biomedical systems to be made through real-world application examples was demonstrated at the MMSGs members of the NC3Rs attended.</gtr:description><gtr:id>12AA73E4-4843-4856-8EF3-623A5A870B86</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-2457038352.691604de25512c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This proposal funded a series of 4 Mathematics in Medicine Study Group (MMSG) workshops held at Imperial College (2009), the University of Strathclyde (2010), the University of Reading (2011) and Keele University (2012). A total of 18 biological and biomedical problems were brought to the four meetings, from academia and industry. Reports were produced on each problem by the MMSG participants, electronic copies of which can be downloaded from the MMSG website (www.maths-in-medicine.org).

The focus of these follow-up meetings was to allow time and exploration of work which had been undertaken at the week-long MMSGs workshops, and the likelihood of this leading to further collaboration and possible outputs in the form of grants and publications. These activities led to a number of publications (as detailed in the Output section of this report) and further funding applications (see Further Funding in this report).



A further outcome of this proposal was the links which were forged with the National Centre for the Refinement, Reduction and Replacement of Animals in experimental testing. The NC3Rs initially contacted Dr Steven Webb (organiser of the Strathclyde MMSG) with respect to submitting a problem on toxicology. This subsequently led to Dr Carl Westmoreland (Unilever) making a presentation to the MMSG audience at Strathclyde asking for mathematical input. The presentation was followed by useful discussion and ways of bringing more mathematics to the toxicology community. Following this, and a growing interest in the use of mathematical modelling as a strategy in the 3Rs, a follow-up one day joint meeting, which brought together key members of the UK toxicology community (both academic and industrial) and UK mathematicians to discuss areas of possibly collaboration, was held in London in April 2011. This subsequently led to a special call for funding by the NC3Rs in July 2011 from which 4 projects were funded. 



The MMSG programme has continued to collaborate with the NC3Rs, specifically advising on the different mathematical expertise available in the UK and bringing the two communities together. A follow-up meeting in the style of a small MMSG was held in April 2013 specifically focused on 4 problems with a remit in the 3Rs. This meeting was very successful and as a result the NC3Rs will be holding future such meetings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This proposal saw two problems brought to the MMSGs which were from industry and non-academic institutions. These were Syngenta (HPPD Inhibition Case Study, Reading 2011) and Institute for Animal Health (Foot-and-mouth disease vaccines). Work from the foot-and-mouth disease problem has been published (see publications) and a publication from the HPPD work is in preparation. The breadth of biological and biomedical problems brought to this round of MMSG workshops means that the results of the meetings could be exploited in a number of ways. Examples include the following.



- Results from the problem &amp;quot;Using mathematical modelling to optimise work flow in the Sanger Mouse Genetics Project&amp;quot; which was brought to the NC3Rs follow-up Study Group in April 2013. The results of this work showed the importance of breeding between different mouse phenotypes in maintaining certain phenotype levels. This work was immediately exploited by the Sanger Mouse Genetics Project in allowing them to re-considering how different stages of the mouse breeding process were implemented;



- Results from the problem &amp;quot;Unravelling the arenavirus budding mechanism&amp;quot; where the recently published work (see Publications) has allowed plausible mechanisms for how virus budding occurs, to be explored and elucidated. This work can be exploited to understand possible ways of controlling and even manipulating the virus budding process; and



- Results from the subsequently funded grant &amp;quot;Development of Zonated HFB for IVIVE of Systemic chemical Toxicity&amp;quot; could be exploited to better understand the effect of systemic toxicity and develop new in vitro and in silico methods for studying toxicity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C23480AE-8936-42F5-8C76-00E5257D9B4A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-590861384.3758237762ded4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.maths-in-medicine.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6E34460D-4628-4442-9A93-89761A17FDD2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cellular entry of nanoparticles via serum sensitive clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and plasma membrane permeabilization.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International journal of nanomedicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/988a9bf4602ba26684ef8f41fe1b3fc6"><gtr:id>988a9bf4602ba26684ef8f41fe1b3fc6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith PJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1176-9114</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d084084b184191</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FE148C72-DCC3-43C0-9AC7-FEF5F96E01EA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Arenavirus budding resulting from viral-protein-associated cell membrane curvature.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/428c5d3a197922a6f2d37aa48c62f20d"><gtr:id>428c5d3a197922a6f2d37aa48c62f20d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schley D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-5662</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0490492435637</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>080577B6-4B48-4F10-ADAD-FC43EC50F027</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modelling the influence of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine antigen stability and dose on the bovine immune response.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/428c5d3a197922a6f2d37aa48c62f20d"><gtr:id>428c5d3a197922a6f2d37aa48c62f20d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schley D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0810813aba3df</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9A2A1B44-4477-4419-A52C-4AA5AD2A0242</gtr:id><gtr:title>The first international workshop on the role and impact of mathematics in medicine: A collective account</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American Journal of Translational Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fa46f5cb8119bec3b14f3a07beead4ba"><gtr:id>fa46f5cb8119bec3b14f3a07beead4ba</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marc Artzrouni (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_329009302413788986</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9D63F6D5-1A9C-41E3-81DD-DFCE1C0FBA59</gtr:id><gtr:title>A stochastic model for early placental development.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/229e79288c6c5d4d4212d2144e1c9618"><gtr:id>229e79288c6c5d4d4212d2144e1c9618</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cotter SL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-5662</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546338511ca174.81236408</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H000755/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
