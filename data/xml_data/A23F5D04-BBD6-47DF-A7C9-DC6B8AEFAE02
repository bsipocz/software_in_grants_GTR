Over time structures acquire a range of meanings as authentic embodiments of the past, including values attached to original fabric, period features, and the patina of worn and weathered materials. Such understandings are associated with cultural, social and economic values that lend support to the importance of conserving and caring for old buildings. However these ideas have the potential to conflict with an increasing emphasis on energy-efficient renovation, entailing a radical transformation of the built environment in response to fears about climate change. Concretely, a range of measures including the installation of micro-generation technologies, insulation, new windows and the adoption of 'smart' technologies, all have the potential to improve the energy performance of older buildings, but also to compromise the historic value of existing structures.

This project examines how ideas about heritage conservation, a set of beliefs about the value of continuity and tradition, exist in relation to ideas about the need for environmentally motivated changes to a range of historic buildings. The project aims to understand the cultural meanings and social dynamics through which heritage and energy futures are constructed, through a study of the attitudes, values and beliefs of a range of building professionals and clients involved in renovation and retrofit. The project uses a mixture of methods, including interviewing and sustained detailed observation in relation to case-study buildings, combined with analysis of the broader discourses and cultural understandings that inform the positions of the professionals and clients involved. The findings will help understand how perceived conflicts between historic value and energy efficiency can be managed and will be used to shape policy and practice in an important but under-researched area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of societal impact is integral to the project. Dialogue and dissemination activities with non-academic partnerships will leverage wider impact, including through targeted publications (see Pathways to Impact and Case for Support). Non-academic project partners, including representatives of leading public and private sector organisations in the areas of building conservation and energy, have pledged &amp;pound;21,150 as in-kind contributions to the project (this figure excludes non-quantified contributions). This gives an indication of the wider potential of the societal and economic benefit of this research. 

The main project beneficiaries will be:

1) Conservation policy makers at national and international levels, who will be able to use the research to fill an important and pressing need for evidence-based policy in relation to sustainable heritage issues (see HS supporting statement). This will feed into ongoing policy reviews at Historic Scotland. Longer term wider impact will be achieved through activities identified via dialogue with stakeholders at the final project seminar.
2) Conservation professionals who will benefit from improved understanding of the perspectives of building professionals and clients on heritage and energy (see supporting statements by Historic Scotland, Sustainable Traditional Buildings Alliance and the Institute for Historic Building Conservation). Project partners will benefit from knowledge gained via ongoing dialogue integral to the project, while wider benefits will be achieved through dissemination activities they have promised as in-kind contributions. 
3) Building professionals dealing with building renovation, including architects (see supporting statement by Institute for Historic Building Conservation, Millar Howard Workshop and the Scottish Civic Trust) and planners, who will benefit from improved understanding of attitudes to heritage and energy conservation among clients and the wider nexus of people involved in modificatons to historic buildings. 
4) Local Authorities who have to manage policies and programmes with conflicting aims and objectives in relation to heritage and energy conservation will benefit from improved evidence to use in decision making. Durham County Council, a project partner, have identified an absence of research on which to base their own policy and practice and have pointed to wider issues relating to the management of historic buildings by Local Authorities. Durham County Council will benefit directly through improved understanding as a result of dialogue and dissemination of research findings. Other Local Authorities, both nationally and internationally, will benefit from dissemination via Durham County Council and other project publications. 
5) Academic researchers in a range of disciplines will benefit from improved understanding of an area of important and emergent area of interest (see Academic Beneficiaries).
6) The PI will benefit from research and career development to consolidate existing interests as a research leader in this field. This will enable him to benefit other researchers in the future through contributions to research, mentoring, teaching and support of other academics and students.
7) The broader public will benefit in the longer-term via interventions to the built environment that effectively manage the tensions between heritage and energy conservation on the basis of improved understandings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>117745</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Building on the Past: professional dialogue (Durham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>212497C5-1B05-49B9-A1C1-099A208B4629</gtr:id><gtr:impact>End of project workshop for dissemination of project findings and dialogue with professionals, practitioners, policy makers and other academics working on these themes, nationally and internationally.

Dialogue with project partners, has already resulted in increased understanding of social dimensions to issues of retrofit, and hence has resulted in professional learning, amongst architects and conservation professionals. 

While the research has yet to result in documented changes in policy, findings from the research are already informing understanding in this area, including through dialogue with Historic Scotland, the government conservation agency. Key findings of the research were made available to the government select committee on Energy and Climate change. 

The end of project workshop enabled dissemination of key findings to relevant professional audiences in the conservation and energy sector and facilitated dialogue between these organisations. Project participants reported change in attitudes, and plans to disseminate findings amongst fellow professionals.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>64EFB89E-B27E-4514-8A75-2ABED41090BA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d8125960ea99.03102023</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction,Energy,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I undertook ethnographic research with architects, planners, a range of building professionals and clients, focusing on the ideas and practices that informed their respective engagements in the renovation and retrofit of old buildings. This resulted in a number of key findings:

When people make decisions about how and whether to modify their homes, energy efficiency is one consideration amongst many. Focusing on home owners ideas about historic significance and authenticity, my research has found that understandings about the meaning and value of the past have several important implications for energy consumption. These help explain why in some cases people can be reluctant to adopt more efficient technologies. 
Firstly, the uptake of energy-efficient technologies is affected by assessments of 'appropriateness' that involve ideas about the value of the past. People's ideas about aesthetic, material and historic continuity frame their perceptions of the degree and kind of change that maintains 'character' and 'authenticity'. I found these considerations are particularly important in relation to decisions about windows and micro-renewables. However ideas about authenticity can also impact on less obviously disruptive changes, for example the use of 'artificial' building materials such as insulation. These assessments are particularly important in relation to traditionally constructed buildings, but also inform decision-making in relation to post-war and even new-build houses. 
Secondly, ideas about the past play a part in people's daily routines and the energy they use. On the one hand, appreciation of the character of old buildings is often associated with tolerance of lower levels of heating and lighting, and with forms of behaviour that adapt to these. On the other hand home-owners' ideas about authenticity, tradition and the past can also promote the use of less efficient technologies, including Agas and open fires. These ideas about character and history may be one reason why increased efficiency does not always mean reduced consumption - something that policy and regulatory frameworks need to recognise. 
My research suggests that a better understanding of what older homes mean to residents and building professionals could help inform more effective policy on both the conservation of energy and the conservation of the built environment. 
These findings are of significant academic and applied importance. While much attention has focused on technical issues relating to the retrofit of old buildings, very little research has focused on the social practices that explain whether and how energy efficient technologies are adopted.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the research are of interest and use for a range of stakeholders, including conservation professionals and building professionals involved in the renovation and retrofit of old buildings, as well as policy makers and third sector organisations with interests in the reduction of energy consumption. Understanding the social practices and values that inform interventions, can be used to shape policy on energy and the historic environment. Findings have the potential to inform professional practice, in ways that will lead to improved outcomes for energy use and the historic environment. 

Some of the projects' key findings have already been disseminated via engagement with key stakeholder groups represented on the project steering committee, and through two applied papers. 

Future publications and activities are aimed at broadening the impact beyond these groups. An applied paper (submitted to Journal of Architectural Conservation) will disseminate key findings for policy and professional audiences. Shortened summaries of this will be published in relevant professional magazines. The end of project workshop (May) brings together academics, professionals and policy makers with interests in these issues, to foster dialogue and identify further pathways to impact.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DB62CC4E-1CE7-4545-AAA6-DC8C210F0FC4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d816ea5f8169.69200139</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Energy,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.dur.ac.uk/anthropology/research/botp/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DE5B9D21-BC34-49B7-889E-76E5B40DA260</gtr:id><gtr:title>Negotiating Heritage and Energy Conservation: An Ethnography of Domestic Renovation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Historic Environment: Policy &amp; Practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35fbad08b02b58bcce859835e127d380"><gtr:id>35fbad08b02b58bcce859835e127d380</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yarrow T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589db6f0517387.85502685</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8D4E443B-0F21-4277-8D1B-0576DCB493F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>REHAB 2015: Proceedings of the 2nd International conference on the preservation, maintenance and rehabilitation of historical buildings and structures</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bbbc2ff8bb527b95e762d2d8f2357b5f"><gtr:id>bbbc2ff8bb527b95e762d2d8f2357b5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yarrow, T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn> 978-989-8734-07-5</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56aa308277f735.07828515</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2DF7B6FE-18B0-4B9B-9AF5-690606F26D14</gtr:id><gtr:title>Building with History: Exploring the Relationship between Heritage and Energy in Institutionally Managed Buildings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Historic Environment: Policy &amp; Practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/50075dcc013dd7907d725464ae054feb"><gtr:id>50075dcc013dd7907d725464ae054feb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adams C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56aa25d064e380.25164563</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L000032/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
