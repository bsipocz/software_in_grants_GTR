The system will integrate various technologies, including a novel UV activated, TiO2 coated flexible fibre mop, microporous bag filter, cross-flow heat exchanger and customised LED light array. The novel AnimalWelfAir system will provide good IAQ and optimised lighting throughout the year leading to better poultry health, welfare and subsequently enhanced productivity. This project will provide a sustainable, innovative solution to the present high fossil fuel consumption and related high carbon emissions while increasing the productivity of the UK and global livestock sector thus reducing the industry's adverse impacts on the environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A multi-factorial approach will be taken in the assessment of the impact of the AnimalWelfAir system in comparison with existing systems with reference to Poultry Welfare. Deep litter poultry production brings a host of welfare-related problems such as pododermatitis, pectoral muscle ulceration from extended contact with wet corrosive litter and respiratory distress from inadequate ventilation designed to maintain room temperature at the expense of indoor air quality (IAQ), predisposing birds to a range of respiratory and systemic infections. We expect our improved IAQ and lighting control approach to significantly improve overall welfare improvement for the birds with raised profitability for producers and will validate this through biological performance measurements in commercial production conditions. The Environmental Agency state that the use of scrubbers and mesh filters in current livestock buildings to maintain adequate IAQ standards face many limitations including: lifetime, high maintenance requirement and degradation of performance over time (Environmental Agency Sector guidance EA, 2011). The proposed Animal WelfAir system overcomes these issues along with improving upon current performance. Extensive online patent searches (Google patent search, IPC, EPO patent search, and UK / US government patent offices) has shown that work has been carried out on the individual components of the Animal WelfAir system (including the patent held by UON). No work has been found relating to the entire Animal WelfAir system.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is timely as the proposed research will investigate an innovative solution to the present high fossil fuel consumption and related high carbon emissions of the UK and global livestock sector thus reducing energy consumption also increasing the productivity. The proposed project aims to design, develop and test an innovative integrated system [Flexible Fibre Mop (FFM)/UV photocatalytic oxidation (UVPCO)/bag filter (BF)/LED lighting] for efficient and cost-effective indoor air quality (IAQ) and lighting control to improve poultry house air quality and animal welfare &amp;amp; production.
The significant market potential of the proposed system will provide the UK with economic benefits due to product sales and employment opportunities. The project will benefit the UK in terms of advancing technology, economic opportunities and positive environmental impact, adding value by providing a platform for collaboration between academic and industrial parties and allowing the UK companies to compete with overseas companies in the field of livestock better comfort control and air quality systems. 
Exploitation of the proposed technology will create new markets for the projects industrial partners with relevant manufacturing and supply chains. Along with export of this technology, this will contribute to the UK economy's recovery and growth. In general, the research will be beneficial to industries, the nation, its people, resource and environment, researchers, and their institutions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>258949</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R021511/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
