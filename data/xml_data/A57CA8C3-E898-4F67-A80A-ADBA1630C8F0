This project investigates the role of a potassium transport mechanism in the red blood cell membrane of birds. High activity causes potassium loss from working muscles, which can lead to muscle fatigue. It is known that stress hormones like adrenaline cause an uptake of potassium into the red blood cells of some birds, which may allow the muscles to work more prolonged. We have found that this mechanism is missing in ostrich and others did not find it in chicken. Both birds are domesticated and have poor to non-existent flying abilities. We want to look at several more domesticated and wild species of birds with different exercise capacities, to assess the importance of stress-activated potassium transport in bird red blood cells. We then select four of these species and determine the molecular structure of the transport protein to understand how changes in its function during the evolution of birds have come about. This study will also help to better interpret disturbances in the potassium balance of birds. This is important because potassium balance is measured using blood plasma and stress hormones released during blood sampling will activate potassium uptake from the plasma into the red blood cells to a different degree in different bird species.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Birds are among the most active of vertebrates, paralleled only by mammals. They are famous for their extraordinary migratory capacities, using aerobically powered sustained flapping flight. Some pursue this exhausting activity even above the summit of Mount Everest, where man is barely able to walk without supplemental oxygen. It is clear now that birds have evolved endothermy, high blood pressure and a dual loop cardiovascular system independently of mammals, but our understanding of how they have achieved their unsurpassed levels of exercise is still incomplete. Strenuous exercise releases large amounts of K+ from the active working muscle into the plasma of animals and this is seen as a cause for muscle fatigue. Birds are unique in expressing a powerful b-adrenergically activated Na+, K+, Cl- cotransport system (NKCC) in their red blood cell (RBC) membranes. Its physiological role is generally seen in the net uptake of K+ from the plasma during exercise and thereby in delaying muscle fatigue. Our preliminary results suggest that this response is absent in ostrich RBCs and this has also been reported for domestic chicken RBCs. Therefore we hypothesise that despite their basic morphological similarity, fundamental physiological differences exist between different groups of birds, which are reflected in the degree to which the acute stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline can activated the NKCC in their RBC membrane. We hypothesize that the functional differences result from structural changes at the level of the NKCC protein and that the magnitude of its adrenergic activation is affected to varying degrees by three main factors. These are (1) genetic selection during domestication, (2) evolutionary history of the group, and (3) the bird's capacity for aerobic exercise. We propose in this project to determine the maximal extent of stress-induced NKCC activation in vitro in RBCs of a number of farmed, laboratory and companion birds and their wild relatives. From this we shall determine where on the bird phylogeny the adrenergic NKCC of RBCs first appeared and where along the chicken lineage it was subsequently lost. Next we will clone and complete the sequence of the NKCC in RBCs of the red jungle fowl, who is the wild ancestor of the domestic chicken and whose draft genome is incomplete in this regard. We shall also clone and sequence the gene from ostrich RBCs. In both cases we shall identify the closest living relatives of these birds, which differ in adrenergic NKCC sensitivity, and determine their sequences. This is used to establish the molecular evolution of the NKCC gene within birds and to correlate differences in the encoded protein structure with the divergence of physiological activation modes. For detailed molecular structure/function analysis we shall then compare the effects of protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors on the interaction of the NKCC with adrenergic agonists, cell volume and oxygen. Plasma K+ concentration are quite unstable and variable in blood samples from birds and this provides problems in the diagnosis of hypo- and hyperkalaemia. We hypothesize that this is due to species differences in adrenergic NKCC activation during blood sampling. Thus, we propose to establish dose-response curves for NKCC activation by natural occurring catecholamines in all investigated species. This forms the basis for improved interpretation of plasma electrolyte status and thereby health and welfare of birds.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>215903</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>02CE326C-4DF4-442D-B660-A3BBDA3060AE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gene turnover in the avian globin gene families and evolutionary changes in hemoglobin isoform expression.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular biology and evolution</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/75dbe00973a41a3796de92adc173b1b8"><gtr:id>75dbe00973a41a3796de92adc173b1b8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Opazo JC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0737-4038</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675ddb3a0f47</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D012732/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
