Early lifestyle changes including stable weight loss and low calorie diet can be effective, but in late stage disease many patients do not respond to current therapies. There is evidence that metabolic cells and immune cells co-localize in adipose (fat) tissue as a result of an evolutionary need to store energy in times of food deprivation and yet provide energy to mount an immune response during infection. This delicate balance appears to be disrupted in the context of over-nutrition, or obesity, and can lead to a chronic activation of immune pathways and serious complications such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. It is thought that some immune cells in adipose tissue can produce protective anti-inflammatory factors, whilst other cells can produce pro-inflammatory factors that lead to problems such as more insulin resistance and diabetes. In this project I plan to investigate the role of a newly identified type of immune cell, named natural helper cells, which are found in adipose tissue, and are thought to produce protective anti-inflammatory factors. The aim of this application is to learn how these cells can be manipulated to control immune responses in adipose tissue and prevent the development of complications during obesity such as diabetes. Techniques have been developed to isolate and characterize these cells. These techniques enable the study of these cells during the progression of obesity and diabetes using humane mouse models.
In summary, I have built a strong foundation in the areas of immunology and cardiovascular disease, developing techniques to study immune cell function during obesity. I believe that the study of these new cells will generate important information about how immune responses can be controlled in adipose tissue during obesity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Obesity is accompanied by chronic, low-grade inflammation that is thought to contribute to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Under normal conditions in adipose tissue, immune effector cells reside alongside adipocytes, and help maintain metabolic homeostasis. However, during obesity, this delicate balance can be disrupted leading to excessive activation of resident immune cells and infiltration of new immune cells, such as T cells, NK cells and monocytes, which along with the adipocytes themselves secrete a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Recent studies demonstrate that the infiltrating T cells display a T helper (Th)-1 pattern of activation, and that an imbalance may exist in obese adipose between resident Th2 cells and T regulatory (Treg) cells that fail to limit an expanding pool of infiltrating pro-inflammatory Th1 cells. 
Natural helper cells (NHC) are a new population of non-NK cell, RORyt-independent cells that can express a cytokine profile similar to Th2 cells in response to activation with IL-33 or IL-25, and have recently been identified in adipose tissue. Importantly, the identification of resident NHCs in adipose tissue raises questions about their potential involvement in affecting Th2 aspects of the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. To investigate how these cells impact on metabolic and immune responses within adipose tissue I propose to study, in depth, the kinetics of NHC recruitment, and chemotactic signals involved, in adipose tissue collected from obese mice and obese patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing bariatric surgery. The mechanistic action of NHC activation on inflammatory and metabolic function will be studied using in vitro culture systems. Finally, using a combination of gain and loss of function approaches we plan to examine the importance of NHC regulation of metabolic processes in obesity and diabetes in vivo. These studies will identify the immunometabolic processes that are regulated by NHCs in vivo.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The economic burden on the NHS in the UK attributable to obesity and type 2 diabetes and their downstream manifestations is considerable, accounting for more than 10% of the NHS budget. Furthermore, obesity and diabetes are set to become greater relative contributors to the burden of cardiovascular disease in the general population, and there is an urgent need to develop new strategies for tackling this disease. Thus, there are a number of non-academic beneficiaries who could benefit from this research, including clinicians (e.g. nurses/doctors), patients, industry professionals, public and children.
Currently effective treatments for obesity and obesity-related complications include lifestyle changes with stable weight loss and a low calorie diet but this is often only effective in early disease. Understanding the basis of adipose tissue inflammation would represent a major improvement in the understanding of how obesity can lead to the more serious complications such diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Ultimately, in the longer term the measurement of inflammatory markers could lead to development of new ways to predict which patients will progress and lead to new interventional strategies and treatments for managing metabolic syndrome. Improved methods for diagnosis and treatment will be beneficial to clinicians and patients alike. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical sector could benefit through the commercial exploitation of new discoveries in the project for drug or biomarker development. 
By hearing about our research through public engagement events patients may feel more motivated to actively take part in beneficial lifestyle modifications for this disease e.g. diet, weight loss, exercise. Furthermore, obesity is rising in children and thus education of children through public engagement events such as the Glasgow Science Festival is potentially extremely important in limiting the number of adolescents entering adulthood already obese. A reduction in obesity and its downstream complications has the potential to have huge economic impact on NHS budgets and thus government policy in future years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>181579</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Rheumatosphere</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8AF75592-B76E-4DF8-A9AF-280B639DF525</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Rheumatosphere&amp;quot; at Glasgow Science Centre.
