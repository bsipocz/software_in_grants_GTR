However, the degree to which political identities that cross borders may be informed by political identities within borders remains a matter of considerable academic debate. It has been argued, for example, that transnational ties represent an impediment to the formation of national and local identifications; a danger to citizenship and integration in countries of settlement (Snel et al, 2006). Others argue that the reverse may also be true. The concept of 'political opportunity structure' has come to suggest that transnational practices take place in local settings; shaped by the particular opportunities and constraints present in different localities (Guarnizo and Smith, 1998; Mahler, 1998). This deviates from the majority of the literature on Muslim transnational relations in particular, in which the focus is very often on the characteristics of the population, or the characteristics of Islamic culture, in a way that ignores &amp;quot;the role of social and political circumstances in shaping how people make sense of the world and then act upon it&amp;quot; (Kundnani, 2014, p.10). 

This project considers the relationship between the local and transnational citizenship experiences of Bangladesh-origin Muslims in London and Birmingham. It investigates local experiences of citizenship in relation to a) different histories of settlement, b) different population profiles in terms of ethnic concentration, age, gender, socio-economic background, length of residence and naturalization status, and c) the different social and political environments of the two cities. The project will examine how these local political identities influence processes of transnational engagement, and consider how transnational identities and relationships in turn inform local political subjectivity. It will draw on the insights of 'political opportunity theory' but depart from it in two key respects. First, previous work has tended to construct migrant populations as homogenous groups and this project will devote greater attention to considering how issues play out differently according to gender, generation and class. Second, it will move beyond characterisations of citizenship based on 'formal status' to consider more 'substantive' dimensions of socio-political engagement - the social, cultural, political, or symbolic 'acts' that legal status may or may not make possible (Isin and Nielsen, 2008). This includes examination of access to education, employment, housing, healthcare and local political processes. In each location, 30 in-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 15 Bengali families in the form of same-sex parent/child dyads. The use of same-sex parent-child dyads will help draw out generational dimensions and focus the issues of continuity and change over time. In addition, 5 oral history interviews and 5 civil society interviews will be conducted in each location, producing a total of 80 interviews, complemented by ethnographic observation with the Bangladeshi community in both field sites. 

In the context of the on-going 'War on Terror', and an increasing political and media focus on a security threat that is 'home grown', the transnational practices of British Muslims have generated particular concern. This has fed into a range of recent policy proposals with respect to the treatment of British subjects who engage in transnational activities the Government does not support, and brings the constitutionally protected activities of a large number of people under increasing surveillance (Kundnani, 2014). In popular debate and the practice of public policy, therefore, transnational ties may affect local experiences of citizenship, but more research is needed to understand how transnational activity is situated in local social, cultural and political milieu.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
1) Civil Society organisations who work with Bangladesh-origin Muslims in London and Birmingham. These will include The Swadhinata Trust and the Community Connection Foundation who will work with the PI in an advisory capacity as part of a Steering Committee. This Committee will have a role to play in the co-production of knowledge, advising the PI every six months on project developments and directions. In addition, links will be made to a broader range of groups working with the Bangladeshi community in each field site who will be invited to attend the end of project workshops.

2) Bangladesh-origin Muslims in London and Birmingham. By building links with a range of Civil Society organizations during the course of the project, and particularly at the end of project workshops, findings will be dissemintated to the members to which they cater. Relationships will also be developed with local media networks in order to disseminate the findings to local constituents. 

3) Policy makers in central and local government. These will be drawn from among: the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Government Equalities Office, the Home Office, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, Tower Hamlets Council and Birmingham City Council.

How will they benefit?
Civil Society organisations will benefit from an examination of obstacles to, and opportunities for, effective citizenship in the two field-sites. The research will examine community needs in relation to naturalization, housing, education, healthcare and employment. This will help the organisations involved to better cater to the needs of the communities they work with in relation to the advocacy, education, training and advice that they provide. The project will use the findings to formulate two working papers specifically for Civil Society (one for each location), tailoring evidence to the needs of users. These will be disseminated and discussed at the end of project workshops.

Bangladesh-origin Muslims in London and Birmingham will benefit from an improvement in the services delivered by these organisations. In particular, the project's knowledge-exchange activities will facilitate a better understanding of the 'internal borders' based on gender, generation and class, which represent a barrier to full and effective citizenship at the local level. These findings will be used to formulate one working paper for the Bangladeshi community which will be disseminated through the Civil Society organisations invited to the workshops and through the local media. In this way, Civil Society organisations will act as 'knowledge brokers' communicating key messages. 

Policy makers in central and local government will gain a better understanding of the nature of the political exclusion faced by Bangladesh-origin Muslims in these two cities. The research will investigate concerns around employment, education and socio-economic disadvantage, as well as the lack of community representation in different public institutions, in order to generate policy recommendations to improve the relationship between Bangladeshi residents and central and local government. Findings will enable government agencies to assess the impact of the way in which they work with this community to support or constrain transnational activity - and the positive/negative impact of this work in terms of local experiences of citizenship. This will not only help them to develop policy initiatives aimed at Bangladeshi-origin groups but may alert them to the implications of current policy directed at Muslim minorities more generally. In order to maximise the potential impact on policy, two briefing papers (one for each location) will be discussed at the workshops and final versions disseminated at the presentations to policy-makers in month 30. These will be accompanied by press releases and engagement with local and national media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>216994</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Community Connect Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Community Connect Foundation</gtr:description><gtr:id>BA64AE76-C24B-461B-A9E9-2C59F725B12B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Rethinking Muslim Migration: Frameworks, Flux and Fragmentation, Ethnic and Racial Studies Review, 2017.
