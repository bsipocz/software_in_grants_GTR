For instance, various pacifist approaches reject the moral permissibility of war and Just War Theorists assert that, if war is to be morally justified, reasonable alternatives to war need to be pursued (the principle of last resort) and war must do more good than harm compared to the alternatives (the principle of proportionality). However, there tends to be a lack of systematic ethical analysis of the issues surrounding each of the alternatives, as well as the alternatives as whole. Although there has been significant empirical analysis of some of the potential alternatives, these have not considered in detail the relevant moral issues.
 
Accordingly, the Fellowship will be used to develop a research project on the ethical issues surrounding the alternatives to war. It will focus specifically on economic sanctions, diplomacy, peace operations, nonviolent resistance, disarmament, and arming rebels. It will ultimately lead to a book (provisionally entitled 'Just and Unjust Alternatives to War') and two journal articles, as well as a research network. It will develop a normative framework on the alternatives the war and two central themes: first, the reasons to pursue the alternatives to war are generally much weightier than the reasons to pursue war because, for instance, of duties to contribute to peaceful international norms; second, wars may nevertheless be permissible sometimes because the alternatives face notable, additional problems of their own. 

My work during the Fellowship will answer the following questions: 
- What are the particular ethical issues surrounding each of the alternatives? 
- Does an analysis of the alternatives to war strengthen the case for 'revisionist' Just War Theory (which focuses more on individual culpability or responsibility for posing an unjust threat in war), 'collectivist' Just War Theory (which focuses more on states, collectives, and the conventional rules of war), or pacifism? 
- How should the Just War requirements of last resort and proportionality be understood? 
- What institutional reforms are necessary to be able to pursue the alternatives in the most morally justifiable manner? 

The Fellowship generally will be very important for my developing my leadership skills. It will strengthen my experience of knowledge exchange and public engagement, with the aim of developing the skills necessary to achieve substantial and clear impacts on policy, and will lead to the development of a new network on the alternatives to war.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given that the research will present clear policy prescriptions on the alternatives to war, a number of non-academic user groups would also benefit from this project:
 
(i) There are several pacifist groups, such as War Resisters' International, Peace Brigades International, Peace Pledge Union, and various Christian pacifist groups, that would have a clear interest in this project. This is because it will consider the case for pacifism and nonviolent resistance, and will assess in general the ethical issues surrounding the alternatives the war. 
 
(ii) A number of NGOs, lobby groups, and think tanks are concerned with the alternatives to war and are therefore likely to be interested in the findings of the research project. For instance, the World Federalist Movement-Institute for Global Policy (WFM-IGP) has a project on 'Peace and Conflict Prevention' and, given its focus on global solutions, should be particularly interested in the project's proposals for reform to establish new institutions for the alternatives to war (in Ch.9 of the monograph). The NGO Committee on Disarmament, Peace, and Security publishes the 'Disarmament Times', coordinates NGO efforts, and facilitates engagement with the UN about disarmament issues, and so should be interested by the project's assessment of the case for disarmament. One of the central aims of One World Trust is the eradication of war and it currently has a program on peace and security, building on the responsibility to protect (RtoP) doctrine. Similarly, one of the central missions of Global Action to Prevent War is disarmament and it runs programmes related to the implementation of the RtoP. Both groups should therefore be interested in my findings about the alternatives to war in general and in relation to the RtoP in particular. Moreover, certain think tanks and lobby groups are explicitly concerned with nonviolence and the alternatives to war. For example, the Albert Einstein Institution aims to advance the study and use of nonviolence in conflict, for instance, by encouraging and publishing policy studies on nonviolence and its past use, as well as by advising groups on nonviolent strategies. My research on the ethical issues surrounding the alternatives to war and nonviolence (e.g., in Ch. 6 of the monograph) should therefore be of interest to groups such as the Albert Einstein Institution. 
 
(iii) Some of the research will focus particularly on the alternatives in relation to the RtoP doctrine. The findings of my research will be relevant to NGOs and think-tanks that are concerned with the RtoP, such as the Asia-Pacific Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, and the International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect (I already have some contacts here). 

(iv) The research will also be relevant for certain UK government departments (the FCO, MOD, and DFID), which have a strong interest in RtoP and conflict prevention (again, I already have some contacts from my previous work). For instance, in a 2011 report on the UK strategy for the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict, the FCO stated that &amp;quot;[t]he UK will continue to promote a shared understanding of R2P [the responsibility to protect]&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;[w]e are also looking for ways to improve the range of tools available to the international community before, during and after conflict to minimise the potential for mass atrocities to occur&amp;quot;. 

The means by which I will disseminate my research to these groups are outlined in Pathways to Impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>145307</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>There are four central societal impacts: 

(1) Significant advancement of understanding of the ethical issues of the alternatives to war as a whole. The project provided a detailed overall assessment of the major normative issues raised by the alternatives to military intervention and war. This significantly advances the prevailing understanding of these issues. For example, in this regard, I have been interviewed by BBC Five Live, BBC Radio Manchester, France 24, and BBC Ulster on the adequacy of international responses, especially in relation to Syria. 

(2) Advancement of understanding of ethical issues surrounding each particular alternative: (i) diplomacy; (ii) economic sanctions; (iii) arming rebels; (iv) nonviolent intervention; and (v) positive inducements. For instance, I have written various blogs on popular sites which have been widely read, reTweeted, and discussed, and during the award I was one of the main speakers for an event on &amp;quot;Rising Powers and Intervention&amp;quot; in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in September 2014, along with several Brazilian diplomats and military commanders.

(3) Development of understanding of options under pillar three of responsibility to protect (R2P) doctrine. Much previous work on R2P is focused on military intervention, with little understanding of what should be done when military intervention is not suitable. Many of the outputs of the project are framed in terms of R2P. In doing so, the project makes it clear that there are a series of plausible options under R2P that do not involve military intervention. For instance, I was one of the main speakers for an event on the R2P organised by the Hague Institute of Global Justice. The participants included the current UN Special Representative for R2P, the Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, the Executive Director of the World Federalist Movement, diplomats and politicians, and other prominent government figures. My findings were also presented at an event in Slovenia in March 2015 on R2P, with several politicians and diplomats present (e.g. from Switzerland and Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs). Some diplomats said that they would use my findings on the importance of states naming and shaming to encourage their states to stand up more. 
 

(4) Development of understanding of the case for the options in response to the ongoing crisis in Syria. I have applied my findings to the case of Syria, particularly in relation to the problems of providing arms to rebel groups (finding 3c) and the case against military intervention (finding 1). For instance, in addition to the above media work, I was one of the main speakers for an event organised by the UK Syrian community on the Syrian crisis, covered by BBC Newsnight, with several high-profile speakers, such as from the Syrian National Coalition, local politicians, and NGOs (e.g. from Amnesty Int).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>71109A01-A94A-468F-BF50-B9AEBC203275</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b313a912a330.29025557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This Fellowship developed a project on the ethics of the alternatives to war, including diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, arming rebels, inducements, and nonviolent resistance. Overall, it provided an assessment of the moral arguments for and against these measures, which had previously received very little attention. In doing so, it developed a normative account of the alternatives to war as a whole, drawing on and developing recent work in Just War Theory.

The Fellowship has resulted in the following outputs: 
(1) A draft of the monograph, 'Just and Unjust Alternatives to War', under contract with OUP
(2) Four full-length articles in leading journals
(3) Two book chapters (both forthcoming)
(4) A working paper
(5) Several blogs on the alternatives to war for leading sites
(6) Over 35 presentations of the research findings, including as main speaker, at international conferences, and to non-academic users
(7) Workshop at the University of Manchester

Finding 1: The Stronger Case for the Alternatives
- There are several, additional reasons to pursue the alternatives to war that are morally important but are widely missed in prevailing accounts of the ethics of war and peace. Thus, the case for looking to the alternatives is much stronger than previously thought. 
- Dissemination of finding: output (1), (7)

Finding 2: The Need to Revise Prevailing Principles of Just War
- The current accounts of proportionality, necessity, and last resort in Just War Theory insufficiently capture the importance of considering the alternatives to war, which raise a host of non-instrumental considerations (i) rarely, if ever, considered and (ii) often not compatible with the narrow accounts of these principles presented in Just War Theory. Thus, these principles require revision to reflect better the alternatives to war. Revised principles of proportionality, necessity, and last resort are delineated in the project.
- Dissemination of finding: outputs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (6).

Finding 3: The Case for Each of the Alternatives
- The project assessed the ethical case for each of the five main alternatives (which was previously not understood or weakly understood). The particular findings are as follows:
- (Finding 3a) Diplomacy: Diplomatic criticism should be seen as a key part of the toolkit for tackling mass atrocities and serious external aggression. For several morally weighty reasons, states are morally required to name and shame - i.e. diplomatically criticise - offending states, even if this criticism will be hypocritical. Dissemination of finding: outputs (1), (2), and (6).
- (Finding 3b) Economic sanctions: Although they can be counter-productive, in general even comprehensive economic sanctions are not as morally problematic as is often claimed. Weighty reasons in favour of them are missed on standard accounts of the ethics of sanctions. Dissemination of finding: outputs (1), (2), and (6).
- (Finding 3c) Arming rebels: For several morally weighty reasons, it is generally impermissible to provide arms to rebel groups, even if the group is fighting a seemingly just war. Dissemination of finding: outputs (1), (2), (5), and (6).
- (Finding 3d) Nonviolent peacekeeping: Nonviolent peacekeeping by NGOs can play an important, albeit limited, role in contributing to the protection of civilians facing serious violations of basic human rights. There are several reasons to use nonviolent peacekeeping this as an option of first resort. Dissemination of finding: outputs (1), (3), (6), and (7).
- (Finding 3e) Positive inducements: Despite worries that inducements may reward wrongdoing, positive inducements can play an important role in addressing mass atrocities and tackling serious external aggression and, overall, are much more morally desirable than several other more coercive options. Dissemination of finding: outputs (1) and (6).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings can be taken forward in the following ways: 

1. The project's findings on the understanding of ethical issues surrounding, and the case for, particular alternatives (Finding 3) can be used by relevant practitioners or those studying economic sanctions, diplomacy, arming rebels, nonviolent peacekeeping, and positive inducements. The findings lead to a better understanding of the relevant ethical considerations for each of the alternatives.

2. The project's findings on the alternatives to military intervention under pillar three of the responsibility to protect (R2P) (Findings 1 and 3) improve understanding of what can and should be done instead of military intervention, when this is not an option or not desirable. This can be taken forward by policymakers, practitioners, and academics who work on R2P.

3. Finding 2 - the need to revise the principles of Just War Theory -- can be used by Just War Theorists to develop further the understanding of the relevant principles of Just War Theory. The revised principles proposed by the project will also be used by Just War Theorists.

4. Finding 1 -- the overall case for the alternatives -- can be used by pacifist groups and other anti-war NGOs to further repudiate the case for war. The findings of the project provide detailed, systematic analysis of why war should generally be eschewed and the alternatives pursued instead. The assessment of these options can be used by these groups to offer positive alternatives, rather than simply be critical and passive.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1252C5FD-106F-4715-B2FB-D1F452CD62D0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b339fa8a3ee9.73434019</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.jamespattison.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>07E331E6-301C-4A11-B318-10AFB72DA07A</gtr:id><gtr:title>THE MORALITY OF SANCTIONS</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Philosophy and Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/367c99bc6422c7b1bc3199a5e5930305"><gtr:id>367c99bc6422c7b1bc3199a5e5930305</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pattison J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b281474892b6.18537490</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BEFCF51B-5F19-40A1-9B0B-EA1E3D06D0D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>The ethics of diplomatic criticism: The Responsibility to Protect, Just War Theory and Presumptive Last Resort</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of International Relations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/367c99bc6422c7b1bc3199a5e5930305"><gtr:id>367c99bc6422c7b1bc3199a5e5930305</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pattison J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b281471fb7f5.02522669</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0817AAFC-22AB-4EB6-8FBA-328A57F5D1C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping the Responsibilities to Protect: A Typology of International Duties</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Global Responsibility to Protect</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/367c99bc6422c7b1bc3199a5e5930305"><gtr:id>367c99bc6422c7b1bc3199a5e5930305</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pattison J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b28146e3cbe0.75113229</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>194A3406-8685-48EF-88E3-844869987D1C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Case for the Nonideal Morality of War</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Political Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/367c99bc6422c7b1bc3199a5e5930305"><gtr:id>367c99bc6422c7b1bc3199a5e5930305</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pattison J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a735270965c97.73166404</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9FFCCCE5-E868-4776-A714-1517720E304C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Ethics of Arming Rebels</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ethics &amp;
