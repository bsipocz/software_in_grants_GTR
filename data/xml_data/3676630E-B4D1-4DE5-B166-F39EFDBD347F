Focussing on literature and performance, particularly in postcolonial and diasporic contexts, it will ask why non-linear narrative has been such a feature of this period's artistic production. If these fractured and experimental forms are a response to the breakdown of the west's grand narratives of progress, what forms of resistance or revision do they provide? In what ways can they be seen to emerge from the increasing interaction of different cultures in the colonial, post-colonial and post-Cold War world? How do such fractured narratives work in postcolonial and diasporic writing and performance? How can these fractured forms explore our culturally diverse society's competing and conflicting narratives? \n\nThe project will also ask in what ways changing understandings of the self have contributed to the disruption of linear narrative, and in particular, how fractured narratives enable the move away from the Cartesian mind/body duality to an understanding of the embodied self, making the writing of the body such an important element in contemporary performance, fiction and life-writing. In addition, if non-linear narratives emerge from the destabilising of traditional hierarchies of power, what are the implications for issues of gender and sexuality in writing and performance? The project will not assume the distinct identity of traditional 'literary' genres, but will ask these questions of all forms of literature and performance as a continuum of work. \n\nUp till now, most investigations of non-linear narrative have been limited to its digital development, seeing it in terms of technological change. While being alert to this research and its implications, the emphasis of this project is different, centring as it does on the relation between fractured narratives and cultural change in the late colonial and post-colonial period, and on intercultural and diasporic exchange in contemporary art practices. Our project is in no way formalistic: rather it will ask what profound social, political and conceptual changes are being mapped in these artistic practices, addressing questions fundamental to an understanding of the role the arts play in negotiating social change in today's culturally diverse society. The project will have in-depth studies of three areas: African/African diasporic performance, Caribbean/Caribbean diasporic life writing, and gender and sexuality in contemporary British diasporic writing and performance. \n\nThe research methods employed will be varied, combining traditional academic means, such as conferences and seminars, with creative practice, plays, performances, readings, musical events, film, video and digital arts. Two doctoral students will be attached to the project, one working on African performance, the other in Caribbean life writing; there will be two artists-in-residence, each for three months. Goldsmiths' strengths in creative writing and innovative performance, in critical creative practice, community arts, urban studies and postcolonial theory, as well as its strong tradition of interdisciplinary research, make it an ideal place for this project. Dissemination will take a variety of forms, through conferences, seminars and creative events, as well as book and journal publication, and the videoing and archiving of events and performances. The outcomes of our research will be of interest both to scholars and to creative artists. It will contribute to the understanding of postcolonial and diasporic literature and performance, their evolution and development, and to the assessment of the nature and impact of contemporary creative practices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>402998</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Produced with a professional cast, and followed by discussion of themes and writing itself, this was a chance for the work of now award-winning playwright Janice Okoh to reexamine a play she had 'completed' a year or more before this event.

Its aim was to investigate how postcolonial and diasporic writing and performance use fractured forms to explore our culturally diverse society's competing and conflicting narratives, and to explore, through creative practice as well as academic analysis, the way these art forms make and shape new and multiple identities, both in terms of cultural affiliation, and of gender and sexuality. The programme comprised academic papers, readings and performances, as well as workshops from our two artists in residence. The conference was open not only to scholars, writers, performers, students from Goldsmiths and other universities, but to local participating schools and members of the general public. Including performances by pupils from two local schools with whom our artists in residence worked over a 5 month period on writing fractured poetry.

The conference aimed to stimulate new ways of conceptualising the field of postcolonial and diasporic performance/writing, asking a series of questions about the links between inter-cultural transformations and political change and the emergence, or perhaps, re-emergence, of non-linear and fractured narrative. 



Papers are invited for the following panels:

? Narrativity in postmodern drama 

? Diasporic narratives 

? Terror and territory in postcolonial narratives 

? Writing across generic borders 

? Intercultural performance and writing

? Postcolonial aesthetics in contemporary fiction 

? Postcolonial performance and the fracturing of narrative

&amp;quot;'Choctalk' Nation': Narrative Sovereignty in LeAnne Howe's Shell Shaker'&amp;quot;. 

Padraig Kirwan's paper considered the ways in which the Native American LeAnne Howe's 'Shell Shaker' appears to engage with various forms of sovereignty (tribal, political, and/or artistic), and will question the extent to which the novel can be said to provide a commentary on moments of contact between the citizens of modern nation states.

'Half-and-half': fractured narratives and the intimacies, limits and possibilities of maid/madam relationships.

Uneasy, hemmed in, she dives repeatedly into her text to forget herself and become Her - but surfaces remembering even more. What wreckage is she finding down there?

The collaboration is a convergence of different histories in theatrical research. Our project began as an exploration of age and memory (personal and cultural) and about what to perform - live - how and perhaps why, today. During its development, inspired by Ibsen's domestic tragedy, our work, inevitably, became haunted by real tragedies of geopolitical disaster and conflict. 

This performance takes the Serbian word for rehearsals 'proba' meaning 'to test' or 'taste' and the French 'r&amp;eacute;p&amp;eacute;tition' meaning 'to repeat' quite literally before your eyes, inviting the spectator to witness a normally private process: the fractured and spiralling dive into conscious and unconscious association as the actor prepares her role. As she tests and repeats the Ibsen text, slipping between her real self and the imaginary she is struggling to represent, she finds both echoes and dissonance within her own life, a relationship with the past and insight into what it might mean 'to act'. 

Sea/Woman is performing in the UK and in residency in Beirut, Lebanon sponsored by the British Council, in January 2011. The project continues performing in the UK and internationally from Autumn 2011. Previews:

It juxtaposed little-known masterpieces in new ways. Starting with Party Time the audience arrives at a cocktail party in which they gradually begin to collude with the 'insiders' against those excluded as political 'untouchables'. The excluded Jimmy speaks from the black depths of his cell at the play's end, becoming the speaker in a monodrama from Pinter's The Examination: victim becomes interrogator who in turn becomes the subject of interrogation. In Press Conference a female minister briefs the press in a chilling display of arrogance and doublespeak, giving way to the horror of A New World Order in which a hooded victim is forced to imagine the torture to which he will shortly be subjected by his two cheerful interrogators. These contrast with Night, in which a husband battles with his wife to assert the truth of his view of their first romantic encounter against hers, while Victoria Station involves the comic interrogation of a taxi-driver waiting in his car by his controller in the central office. Mountain Language shockingly exposes the erotic pleasure of authority figures interrogating political prisoners denied the freedom to speak their own language. Directed by Robert Gordon and David Peimer, the performance presented later works seldom seen outside London to audiences across Europe. The production premiered at an international conference on Harold Pinter in Maribor, and was performed during our third conference at Goldsmiths and toured to Prague, Berlin, Budapest, Brno, Bratislava and Thessaloniki between September and December 2011, playing to audiences of scholars, students and the general public.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0BF6B857-8BA5-401F-99C8-8ACA7C475C6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>First performance of some late plays by Pinter in European countries in which only his early plays are known.

PhD student Ekua Ekumah read from the work of Ghanian Poet. 



As an exercise to publicise the project, the event was a success, and went some way to establishing a scholarly community to engage with it. Some attendees of this launch subsequently attended events throughout the following three years, and many presented papers at one or more of our conferences. Most people attended at least one further event. 



Audience members ranged from academics at Goldsmiths to practitioners and writers and members of the public interested in hearing the readings. Many came from the local area of South East London.
