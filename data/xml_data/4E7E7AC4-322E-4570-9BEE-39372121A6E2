These disorders are caused by an accumulation of proteins that are incorrectly folded, leading neurons to malfunction and die. One reason why these misfolded proteins accumulate in older individuals is that mechanisms designed to detect and remove proteins that misfold during times of stress break down as we age.
We work on one of these mechanisms, a stress response pathway called the UPRER. We aim to find out why the UPRER is no longer effective in older cells, and whether this contributes to the development of neurodegenerative disease. This will enable us to ask whether restoring UPRER function in older individuals can protect them from disease onset.
Our other main interest is in finding out how the sensing of stress by neurons switches on stress responses such as the UPRER in other parts of the body. We will find out which genes and molecules are required for neurons to activate stress responses in other tissues, and whether only certain neurons are able to communicate in this way. This will enable us to determine whether switching this pathway on or off affects the ageing process or disease development. This may suggest ways to manipulate the pathway to prevent or treat neurodegenerative disorders.
Together, these studies will help us to understand why neurodegenerative diseases develop, and suggest new therapeutic approaches to address them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Many neurodegenerative diseases emerge late in life, making ageing the primary risk factor for a range of disorders including Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s diseases. Ageing is associated with an increase in protein misfolding and aggregation, which is believed to underlie these age-onset neurodegenerations. One factor that may contribute to this increase in protein aggregation is a breakdown in cellular stress responses, mechanisms designed to detect and resolve stress-induced misfolding.
One of these stress responses, the ER unfolded protein response (UPRER), monitors the folding of proteins within the secretory pathway. We have found that the ability to activate the UPRER declines with age, leading to a loss of resistance to stress in older animals, and that stress resistance can be rescued in older individuals by restoring this signaling pathway. Moreover, activating the UPRER only in neurons is sufficient to increase stress resistance and extend lifespan, suggesting that neurons play a critical role in protection from stress and that a loss of UPRER function in neurons may underlie aspects of ageing and disease development.
We are now working to define the mechanisms underlying the loss of UPRER activation with age, and the role this plays in neurodegenerative disease. To do this we will use C. elegans models of neurodegeneration, in which disease-associated proteins are expressed in specific tissues, and activate the UPRER by expression of the activated transcription factor xbp-1s in these animals to determine whether onset and progression of aggregation and toxicity are modulated by UPRER activation. We will then express xbp1s in mouse models of Alzheimer?s disease to monitor effects on disease onset and outcomes.
Our work has also identified a pathway by which UPRER activation in neurons can induce cell non-autonomous UPRER activation in distal tissues, a process that requires neuronal secretion and is essential for the beneficial effects of neuronal UPRER activation. Identifying the components of this pathway will help us to understand how neurons orchestrate whole-body physiological responses to environmental conditions, and give us the opportunity to manipulate this pathway for therapeutic purposes. We have used metabolomic, genetic and RNA-seq screening approaches to identify genes and molecules involved in this pathway, and will now characterize the specific roles of these candidate components. To do this we will use C. elegans reporter strains that allow us to detect UPRER activation in different tissues, so that we can determine whether gene expression or knockdown, or treatment with different signaling molecules, induces or inhibits non-autonomous UPRER activation. We can then manipulate these neuronal pathways to determine their effects on ageing and disease models. In addition, we will use reporter strains to see in which neurons the UPRER is activated under stress, and then express xbp-1s in those neurons, to find out which specific neurons and neuronal types are responsible for sending UPRER-activating signals. These approaches together will increase our understanding of the cell non-autonomous control of protein folding, and suggest new avenues for treatment of neurodegenerative disease.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>825047</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Babraham Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Analysis of lipid changes in C. elegans expressing neuronal XBP-1s</gtr:description><gtr:id>27E4AB19-4329-47FB-A3FA-F55A3A077AD9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lipidomics data has been obtained, which will be incorporated into a publication on this topic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e037b6b5ce94.36780499-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborators ]analysed our C. elegans samples by HPLC in order to provide information regarding lipid content.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We provided C. elegans samples from animals expressing XBP-1s in different tissues.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Babraham Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Bioinformatic analysis of C. elegans RNA-seq data</gtr:description><gtr:id>5CCE02B6-D38E-4A99-9341-E5CEDDDEB7A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b04fec3018c1.57736037-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborators have assisted in the analysis of RNA-seq data</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We provided raw data from RNA-seq experiments for collaborative analysis</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for Diet and Activity Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>Analysis of metabolomics in C. elegans expressing neuronal XBP-1s</gtr:description><gtr:id>B79460ED-088B-41E9-B47C-37A95AF9C913</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b04f66a14097.66349025-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborators analysed our C. elegans samples by GC-MS and NMR in order to provide information regarding lipid, protein and metabolite content.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We provided C. elegans samples from animals expressing XBP-1s in different tissues.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MRC Lab Visits - LMB Crystal Growing Competition</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>55FEB46E-3F25-4124-AF36-071AC18713B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Winning schools were invited to bring students to visit the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge for a half-day of science.
