The reasons for this are not clear, and it may be that some infants are at higher risk of impairment due to differences in their genetic profile. By combining brain imaging with genetics and systems biology I aim to uncover potential mechanisms that could contribute to brain development in preterm infants.

Background: Around 1 in 13 babies in the UK are born early (preterm), i.e. before 37 weeks gestation. There have been major improvements in survival of these infants, but the challenge now is to improve the future for surviving infants and their families. Those born extremely preterm have a 1 in 3 chance of mild cognitive difficulties and a 1 in 8 chance of cerebral palsy, while autism and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia are at least 2 to 3 times more common.

Brain imaging with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a safe non-invasive technique that provides information on brain structure and function. Compared to infants born at full term, preterm infants show signs of damage to the physical and functional connections within the brain, and smaller volumes of structures that contribute to the relay and processing of signals.

Genetics is an additional source of information that has not been investigated thoroughly in preterm infants. We know that siblings are at increased risk of neurological conditions related to prematurity and this indicates that genetic factors are important in these diseases. 

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the hereditary code in all cells that provides instructions for the function of each individual cell. Genes are the sections of DNA that contain information to make products like proteins. DNA is made of a long sequence of units called nucleotides: A,C,T and G. A difference between people at one nucleotide is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), resulting in different versions of the SNP (alleles). SNPs can happen anywhere in the DNA sequence, but if they happen within a gene they can affect function of that gene. As the DNA code is the same in most parts of the body, we can use saliva samples as a safe and accurate way of studying the DNA in the brain. 

SNPs can be mapped to nearby genes or certain regions of DNA, giving an idea of the function of that section of DNA. If an allele of a particular SNP is more common in a group of people with a disease than in a comparison group of healthy people, that allele might increase risk for that disease. Common disorders related to the developing brain are due to many genes or their protein products interacting with undesirable consequences. In this situation each gene has a small part to play, but taken together the effect is stronger. Some groups of genes are known to frequently function together in pathways, and these groups can be easier to identify as a pattern rather than focusing on individual genes. 

Methods: I will work on a large amount of information that is currently being collected independently as part of the ePrime study (http://www.imperial.nhs.uk/discoveryscanning/) led by Prof David Edwards. This includes brain imaging for 500 preterm infants, with follow-up at two years for neurological examination and collection of saliva samples for DNA analysis. All (imaging, genetic and neurological exams) will be complete by mid 2015. 

DNA from saliva will be analysed focusing on common variation in sections of DNA involved in production of proteins. I will also examine networks of SNPs and their associated genes and proteins to uncover new patterns within the data. Imaging and genetics for all the infants will be analysed together in a model that can take into account the patterns of variability within and between large datasets. This model will be guided by biological knowledge and will highlight biological pathways associated with changes in brain structure and connectivity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: Despite reductions in mortality among preterm infants, 30-50% of those born very preterm are cognitively impaired, 10% have cerebral palsy, and 5% have autistic spectrum disorders. The underlying processes remain unclear but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and candidate gene studies suggest correlates for imaging and functional abnormalities. New mathematical approaches allow imaging and genomic data to be combined, taking advantage of the multivariate nature of the datasets.
Aims: To develop and implement new methods uniting imaging and genomic data to identify determinants of abnormal neurodevelopment in preterm infants. 
Objectives: To analyse a previously collected data library for 500 preterm infants, and explore the relationship between pathway and network based genetic variation and neuroanatomical features. 
Methods: Data previously collected from 500 preterm infants as part of the ePrime study will be analysed. This includes brain MRI at term equivalent age, and follow-up at 2 years for saliva sample collection and neurodevelopmental assessment. SNP genotyping in exomic regions will be done using the Illumina HumanCoreExome chip. Genetic architecture will be investigated using network and pathway approaches based on SNP, gene and protein interactions. Neuroinformatics tools including tract-based spatial statistics, whole-brain connectivity approaches and cortical diffusion will be used to extract differences in tissue injury and neuroanatomical connectivity. Using a pathways sparse reduced-rank regression model informed by prior knowledge, SNP data grouped in pathways and sets will be compared with voxel-level MRI data to identify gene pathways associated with imaging endophenotypes and correlated with outcome. 
Scientific and medical opportunities: With this multi-modal approach we expect to uncover pathological mechanisms that previously eluded detection, and that could be used to guide development of novel targeted therapies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>- Preterm infants will directly benefit from my work through the downstream development of potential new treatments to prevent brain damage and disability. An improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes will reduce the heavy load on families caring for children with high levels of need. This will have extended benefits for the well-being of those directly involved in care for the child as well as society. Fewer resources will be required for lifelong care of disabled children, and we can reduce the loss of productivity associated with the disability of the individual and the care provided by others. On a broader scale this could influence the allocation of resources within the NHS, allowing interventions to be targeted towards prevention rather than management of disability. 

- Complications of preterm birth are the largest cause of neonatal deaths worldwide, and the second most common cause of death in children under 5. Although the initial research has to be done in a resource rich setting due to the technologies and academic context required to test hypotheses, the end result will be useful in a broad range of socio-economic settings. 

- Preterm brain injury is an important model for understanding brain development and function, by investigating the neurodevelopmental consequences of the severe insult of preterm birth. New knowledge in this field can be extended to inform understanding of disease in other clinical populations such as term infants or adults. Feedback into the greater Neuroscience community can open new collaborations and avenues of research. This has already happened as a result of this pilot work, with collaborations emerging with Prof Moln&amp;aacute;r's group in the Department of Physiology Anatomy and Genetics at Oxford University, and internally at the Centre for the Developing Brain with Profs Hagberg and Gressens in Perinatal Brain Injury. 

- The development of cost effective diagnostics and therapeutic interventions aimed at vulnerable ifants can help both established and emerging health systems prioritise care with limited resources. The clinical populations at Hammersmith and St Thomas' Hospital are already benefiting from the corollaries of dedicated neonatal MRI suites at both sites, installed with research and immediate clinical impact in mind. Interaction of the research team including fellows and research nurses with families and the general population is crucial in increasing familiarity with clinical science. Genetics research in particular is an area of research that requires an open and informed discussion of research implications.

- A fruitful partnership could develop in the longer term with the pharmaceutical sector, in the eventuality of development of a new drug to target mechanisms of white matter damage. Joint development of novel drug therapies can streamline processes improving cost effectiveness for the public sector as well providing a commercial source of revenue for academic institutions and private industry.

- Charities and their stakeholders benefit from the evidence of progress in the field, much of it originally funded by them. Research into genetics and therapeutics in children and particularly neonates is fraught with public unease. As such, most drugs in current use have been licensed only for adults and not children. This research will add essential knowledge to a very minimal base of genomic insight in infants, and the end products will help to create a more hospitable climate among policy makers and the public for future endeavours in the field. Additional funding can be generated by reporting of findings and public engagement, in a positive feedback cycle.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>185039</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Subplate integrative genomics</gtr:description><gtr:id>41FCCB63-5F91-4319-9820-7A902DF927E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Expression profiling of mouse subplate reveals a dynamic gene network and disease association with autism and schizophrenia.

I have now participated in this activity for two years.

Selected students from Years 10 and 11 are taking part in a Medicine Project with Professors and Doctors from St. Thomas's Hospital. We are investigating research questions that interest us, and learning about different careers in Medicine. We are very lucky that our sponsor, Mr Dangoor, was able to help us make this link. On Monday six specialists visited Westminster Academy to give talks in different scientific fields, from medical physics to paediatric neurology. We got some time to ask questions and afterwards had a more individual and informal discussion over refreshments in Sky Dining. The opportunity to meet these doctors and was amazing, and we learnt a lot! We are really grateful to them for taking time out of their busy schedules. We all enjoyed their visit very much and are excited about visiting St. Thomas' Hospital later in the term.
