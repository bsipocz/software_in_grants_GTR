In the 1950s the musical canon emerged as a focal point for pan-Germanic tensions, and anniversaries of Germany's illustrious musical figures were seized upon in both the Federal Republic and the GDR as nation-building and propaganda opportunities. Constructs of the canon in the GDR reflected the ideals of collective socialism and reinforced official narratives of the state as the true successor to the heritage of the German Enlightenment. By the 1970s in contrast, as the promised socialist utopia failed to materialise, the canon emerged as a vehicle for the GDR's discontented to express their disillusionment and to criticize the state. Artists no longer identified with portrayals of figures such as Beethoven and Schumann as revolutionary heroes; far more relevant were interpretations that focused on their isolation and alienation from nineteenth-century society. Focusing on the reception of romanticism and the wider nineteenth-century musical heritage, this project explores constructs of the canon in the GDR. I examine official and academic narratives and analyse a range of creative responses to the romantic tradition, including compositions, opera productions, and films. At the heart of the project is the premise that canons serve as a site for contemporary political, social, and cultural discourse. I am interested in determining how external factors such as major political crisis points shaped canonic reception, and in turn explore the extent to which this reception can serve as a lens through which to explore the heterogeneity of musical culture in the state. \n\nMy project aims to challenge the current literature on music in the GDR, which adheres firmly to paradigms of dictatorship that have come under harsh scrutiny in other disciplines. Recent studies of canonic reception focus solely on government appropriation of the canon. They portray the state as a monolithic top-down regime and East German musicians simply as an extension of the party (Thacker, 2007; Janik, 2005; Potter, 2003; Klingberg, 1997). My research seeks to move musicology beyond these ideological and methodological constraints in order to construct a more accurate picture of musical culture in the GDR. The project is based on extensive research in state archives, opera archives and in the archive of the Akademie der K&amp;uuml;nste. This work is complemented by studies of newspapers, journals and monographs on nineteenth-century music that were published in the state, and by analyses of musical scores and audio-visual materials. This diverse range of sources allows for a much more nuanced picture of musical practices in the GDR to emerge. I contest the prevailing notion that a single official construct of the canon permeated all aspects of musical life, and explore how the various responses to romanticism reveal not only the complexity of the relationships between artists and politicians, but also the spaces for creativity that existed in discourses of power and censorship. Ultimately this raises questions about the artistic legacy of the GDR, and undermines current tendencies to deny the legitimacy of art produced in the state. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of my research will be a) professional groups and practitioners working in music performance and opera, and b) members of the general public with an interest in opera and/or twentieth-century music. The impact will be both cultural and social. The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:\n\n- To raise awareness of a neglected body of music;\n \n- To enhance understanding of musical culture in the GDR;\n\n- To contribute to an understanding of the role that history and cultural canons play in society, particularly in the Cold War period;\n\n- To encourage discussion about wider issues pertaining to the relationship between art and politics. The project should stimulate both professionals and the public to consider why the artistic legacy of the GDR has been neglected, whether it is of cultural value, how cultural value is determined, and what role politics play in this process;\n\n- To increase awareness of the impact of the GDR on contemporary opera-production practices in Europe. \n\nInitially I will communicate with beneficiaries on a local level. I have been approached by the Scottish Wagner Society about the possibility of giving a talk to members on Wagner reception in the GDR in 2011. I will also curate a concert of tape pieces composed in the GDR during the 1980s as part of the Edinburgh Soundings Festival in February 2011. The programmed works, which I discuss in my monograph, reflect the creative emphasis on romanticism that pervaded art in the final years of the GDR. The performance of the works will be contextualised in a pre-concert talk, which will allow audience members to engage with the broader findings of my research. Given the absence of East German compositions from the established electro-acoustic canon, the concert represents a useful starting point for discussions about the relationship between art and politics.\n\nThere is considerable scope to widen the cultural and social impact of the project. Over the course of the Fellowship, I will explore further opportunities to give public lectures, engage with the media, and advise concert programmers in both the UK and Germany. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>67606</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Changing Perspectives on Romanticism in East German Narratives of Nineteenth-Century Music</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3CB7DF05-8EAE-4870-A2CB-06D330C3E9BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This talk was a contribution to a three-day seminar entitled &amp;quot;Recycling Romanticism,&amp;quot; which was organised as part of the German Studies Association's annual conference in Denver in 2013.

Following the talk a number of the participants also attended a study day that I led for the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, which was on a related topic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>563e615f3e3b46.00494756</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.wagnerscotland.net/event/sunday-june-21st-2015-730pm</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Composers' Roundtable (Edinburgh)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E00B4BE-A479-4C57-A695-119CE0A30FA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I organised and chaired a roundtable discussion with the East German composer Georg Katzer, a major figure in my research, and the British composer Trevor Wishart, as part of Edinburgh University's Soundings Festival.

The canon was not simply a weapon of dictatorship, used to legitimize the state; it also served as an important forum for criticism and individual expression. 2) That the preoccupation with the past in the early years of the state can not just be ascribed to political opportunism. It is indicative of the wider importance of tradition, metanarratives, and heroic icons in the construction of new societies.3) That the decline of a society can be traced in its artistic discourse. The preoccupation with artistic &amp;quot;lateness&amp;quot; in the final decades of the GDR, as manifest by the rejection of classicism in favour of romanticism, the &amp;quot;heroic&amp;quot; in favour of late Beethoven, and unified stagings of Wagner in favour of a post-Brechtian approach, reflects the wider onset of late socialism. As the socialist utopia failed to materialize, and the onset of real-existing socialism brought with it an increasingly fractured and alienated society, intellectuals turned to paradigms of interpretation that emphasized contradiction and fragmentation rather than resolution and totality.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will be of use from an academic perspective for scholars working in a variety of disciplines (e.g. music, history, German studies) on the Cold War and German culture in the twentieth century. 

More generally, the research brings to light a body of creative work that has received little attention until now. As such it might of interest to concert organisers and musicians.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A540E8DD-E90F-417C-B816-D9C422AF7193</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1531380565.4005977936fe0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A5CD5CA6-19EF-4E58-B4B5-9E85CEB3FFDA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Remembering and Rethinking the GDR</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/96ada0b8fe4404202c39487f2350c4c2"><gtr:id>96ada0b8fe4404202c39487f2350c4c2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelly E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780230360570</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56bc795baa6953.59196610</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9756F62D-3F98-44DE-91CF-F1CCBBC5BCBF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Composing the Canon in the German Democratic Republic: Narratives of Nineteenth-Century Music</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f82ddf82225879ed713898416931ea37"><gtr:id>f82ddf82225879ed713898416931ea37</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelly, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0199998098</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>543fbad374d537.20351646</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A3FFA4AC-FE12-4DE2-927B-F3CBB06D7225</gtr:id><gtr:title>Art as Utopia: Parsifal and the East German Left</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Opera Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/96ada0b8fe4404202c39487f2350c4c2"><gtr:id>96ada0b8fe4404202c39487f2350c4c2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelly E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54609f74e93b51.81339106</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H038981/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>120E89AC-386D-4E25-9417-A3FE4D6FE83A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
