These platforms come in many shapes and sizes; some stay on the surface like boats, such as the Liquid Robotics Waveglider, while others travel from the surface to 1000m depth, such as the Kongsberg Seagliders. All of these platforms are very flexible and can be equipped with sensor packages to look at a wide range of ocean properties. The information collected is then transmitted back in real time and makes them ideally suited to answering a whole range of biological, chemical and physical questions which are directly relevant to protecting our marine resources.

In the face of reduced funds and declining budgets, these platforms are an excellent alternative to costly ships. They cover large distances over months and therefore also can tell us a lot about how ocean processes change in both space and time. Using this fairly new technology requires understanding how they work and having the proper tools to make best use of the information they collect. Without this prior knowledge, investigations may not be designed in a way to answer the questions posed by UK and European legislative requirements. The goal of this project is to transfer the expertise and the tools built through years of NERC-funded research at the University of East Anglia (UEA), an institute with a specialist glider group, to Cefas, the UK governments Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. In particular, the project will look at what combinations of platforms work best to avoid overlapping observations and minimise costs. An experiment using both a Seaglider and a Waveglider will look how sediment and ocean productivty is effected around wind farms. A brand new sensor will also be used to listen to the noise produced by the wind turbines and understand how this noise spreads in the ocean.

Cefas' role is to monitor the health of UK waters and provide policy advice to inform future government decisions. Alongside, Cefas must expand their capabilities to wider scientific and geographic areas. Both Cefas and UEA currently have links with countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (namely Kuwait, Qatar and Oman). This project's second aim is to cement these links, and create a pathway through a UEA-Cefas collaboration for UK industry and policy &amp;amp; research institutions to develop commercially in the GCC by using UK expertise and technology to answer critical questions about the waters around the GCC.

The results of this internship will be made available in a scientific publication, illustrating the best approaches for using multiple platforms together. The opportunities for UK stakeholders to develop within the GCC will be discussed at a workshop and a report will be produced for attendees.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24528</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sultan Qaboos University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Oman, Sultanate of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Marine Science and Fisheries</gtr:department><gtr:description>Sultan Qaboos University</gtr:description><gtr:id>4CAD4E70-0E72-40A8-9FA1-B70EC7DCFD00</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Proposal submitted to the Omani Research Council.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6e4070b8b94.61610537-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided input and suggestions for the development of an autonomous monitoring programme utilising gliders, surface vehicles and moorings.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Working to develop a monitoring programme along the coast of Oman.

It aimed to encourage the use of novel (and low-cost) platforms for marine monitoring both within the UK and on a European level.
This project has led to the involvement of both Cefas and the University of East Anglia as joint partners within the European Ocean Observing System.
The skills developed are being disseminated and advertised abroad, primarily in the Middle East, with the aim of encouraging blue growth. Cefas and UEA developed strong links with 5 Oceans consultancy in Muscat and Sultan Qaboos University which had the benefit of providing infrastructure for an emergency glider recovery that was part of another project.

During the &amp;quot;Implementing smart autonomous instrumentation&amp;quot; Innovation Internship (NE/N012658/1), I reached out to interested parties within marine governance, industry and governmental institutions and identified a key problem hindering uptake of autonomous platforms by non-experts: although glider technology has now reached maturity, there does not exist a single set of software tools capable of processing data from all glider platforms. Due to the inherent difficulty in treating data from such moving platforms, it is today impossible to use them without a costly investment in developing expertise in processing and data analysis.

Over the past decade, most data analysis software has been developed ad-hoc and tailored to survey-specific topics or problems. Three organisations have developed multi-instrument toolsets, the French CNRS, the European Coriolis data centre and the NERC British Oceanography Data Centre (BODC). They manage and store quality controlled data from the multiple glider platforms in a uniform standardised format, providing them to the public and for real time assimilation into ocean forecasting. Although they perform basic quality control, much work remains, in particular in terms of accurately modelling glider flight for sub-surface positioning and processing of biogeochemical variables. Some software packages, such as those provided by the manufacturers, provide a robust but limited, baseline. These are instrument specific and lack the more intricate or recent data correction approaches. For example, Teledyne Webb, manufacturer of the Slocum gliders, provide a tool called Datavisualiser. The tool is not designed for scientific analysis, but allows the glider pilot to inspect the glider's behaviour and sensor output. In particular, this tool is tied to the server used to pilot the instrument; this prevents data from being distributed and analysed by other parties. Igloo (Inspecting Glider data in the Office or Ocean) is an open source Python application developed at NERC National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and German Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG) serving the same purpose as TW's Datavisualiser. The main difference is that the program is standalone and easily distributed, rather than requiring the piloting server. It is however not available online or accessible to non-academic users and its development state is uncertain. Seagliders, now manufactured by Kongsberg, are the second most prevalent glider platform globally. A set of python and Matlab scripts distributed by the manufacturer convert raw &amp;quot;engineering&amp;quot; data into a relevant scientific format and perform a limited amount of quality control but do not provide any accurate processing of biogeochemical variables or fine-tuning of hydrodynamics parameters. 
There are only two software packages performing advanced analysis of physical, biogeochemical and hydrodynamic data. The University of East Anglia (UEA) Glider Toolbox is only has been developed for the Seaglider platform and provides advanced tools with a graphical interface to simplify data processing for non-expert users. The Balearic Island Coastal Observing and Forecasting System (SOCIB) toolbox is possibly the most advanced of all, assimilating and processing data from Slocum and Seaglider platforms using state of the art methods, but has a steep learning curve. Additionally, as with the UEA toolbox, it is dependent on the expensive Matlab software, which is not often found outside of academia. Several other initiatives exist but focus principally on glider management (mission design, glider piloting, and superficial data visualisation).

It is apparent that none of the leading glider analysis software packages satisfy the user requirements that would make them compatible with all glider platforms, easy to use by experts and non-experts, and able to assimilate raw data to provide fast and easy access to the value added products derived from glider data (e.g. processed and gridded fields). This was also a leading conclusion of the European Framework 7 (EU FP7) project &amp;quot;Gliders for Research Ocean Observation &amp;amp; Management&amp;quot; (GROOM) final report: &amp;quot;convenient tools to use gliders and fleets of gliders must be further developed. They can allow opening wide perspectives for the design of experiments with gliders for fundamental physical, chemical and biological ocean research and applications.&amp;quot; NERC has invested heavily in autonomous underwater vehicles, notably with the creation of the 'Marine Autonomous and Robotics Systems' division as part of the National Marine Facilities Sea Systems. This investment has demonstrated great success through several significant NERC programmes such as the Ocean Surface Mixing, Ocean Submesoscale Interaction Study (OSMOSIS), Shelf Sea Biogeochemistry (SSB), Fluxes Across Sloping Topography of the North East Atlantic (FASTNEt), MASSMO, and the British Antarctic Suvey's work west of the Antarctic Peninsula. These projects have led to significant scientific and methodological advancements. Unfortunately, the proportion of time spent in the field relative to refurbishment or storage for gliders across Europe remains low (on average &amp;lt;10%, GROOM usage report). To reap maximum benefit from this instrumentation, perceptions must change from a specialist research instrument to a routinely used monitoring tool within the non-academic community. As the UK does not currently have a unified toolset to deal with all platforms from all NERC institutions, and no suitable alternative is available internationally, it would be both timely and important to develop one which would place NERC research at the forefront of the rapidly expanding field of autonomous gliders.
