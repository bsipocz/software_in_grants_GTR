We have developed a novel technology which allows us to generate new fungal strains that might have enhanced properties for use in the production of certain food products. This would include the production of strains with novel flavours which would have societal and market appeal; strains with lowered content of potentially harmful 'mycotoxins' and salt use, which would therefore be of benefit to health; and strains with faster growth rates that would be of benefit to the food producers due to reduced manufacturing costs. We aim to use out novel technology to produce a range of new fungal strains, which will be screened for desirable combinations of such flavour, health and growth characteristics. These will then be used in trials with taster panels to gauge the appeal of the new strains, before possible large-scale production and exploitation of the novel strains in collaboration with partners in the food industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>125273</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Highland Fine Cheeses</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Industrial collaborations to test novel fungal strains</gtr:description><gtr:id>60C261BB-B2EE-46FC-BD56-93D8239109D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>(1) Iniitial cheese production trials have been performed.

The patent related to the invention of novel Penicillium strains, the production of novel Penicillium strains, and the use of novel Penicillium strains, in particular in the production of cheese. The application covered 22 pages including text and supporting scientific data. The patent had two main claims:
(1) The invention provides a method of producing strains of Penicillium by sexual reproduction. Specific methodology relating to sexual crossing methods was claimed, and the outcome that preferably the strain produced by sexual reproduction has a novel flavour profile; preferably this flavour profile is different to that of either parent used in the sexual cross. Biochemical methods to distinguish the novel strains were described. Strains produced by the crossing method might be used in the production of foodstuffs and cheese in particular. Alos the production of other useful metabolites wuth possible health beneficial properties, lower mycotoxin content and altered enzymen activity.
(2) A method of producing a novel fungal strain with change in the colour of the spores produced was also claimed, using strains derived from sexual crossing. This comprised the step of mutating the strain to a novel colour, with examples provided.</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>BB/L024470/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>F1CA56EE-3C0D-468D-98A9-72B3069AED6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Have ongoing discussions with commercial partners about a possible spin-out company or technology translational partnership.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>58b481d6104153.45133791</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:patentId>1520209.6</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Novel Fungal Strains for Cheese</gtr:title></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overall aim of work was to develop new fungal strains for use in the food industry, specifically for production of blue cheeses. Work made very good progress with most target milestones met as below.
(1) We successfully isolated over 40 samples of Pencillium roqueforti for sexual crossing work from different UK and worldwide blue cheeses.
(2) We set up sexual crosses with these Pencillium roqueforti strains, and by collecting the arising sexual offspring we were able to generate 30 novel strains for possible production use (from Roquefort, Stilton and Gorgonzola parents). 
(3) The 30 novel strains were screened by a newly developed lab flavour system (GC-MS based) and HPLC for toxin presence (a safety measure) and the most promising taken forward for cheese production trials. However, this aspect of work was delayed as a previously published lab method for flavour determination that we had planned to use was found to be unreliable, necessitating the development of a new assay. Thus, time was lost on the project meaning that not all milestones could be achieved.
(4) Eighteen novel strains, together with production strains as controls, were used in small-scale cheese production trials with an industrial partner. Resulting cheeses were tested by professional and amateur cheese tasting trials. Of 20 cheeses tested, 4 out of the top 5 rated for taste included, excitingly, some of the novel strains produced. 
(5) Preliminary work was undertaken to assess the possibility of production of colour mutants of Penicillium roqueforti. A UV-mutation system (i.e. non GM) was successfully devised which allowed generation of a variety of promising colour mutants (e.g. green, red-brown, fawn, bright blue).
(6) From work arising a patent has been filed to protect the Intellectual Property and methods for generating new strains. Also further Follow-on Fund support has been obtained to now further test the selected strains in commercial-scale production trials, to conduct necessary safety screening, and to generate colour mutants of these for taste and market appeal analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Work is still in progress and a further round of follow-on funding has been granted to allow development for commercialisation of the work. A patent has been filed to protect the Intellectual Property and methods for generating new strains. Already two industrial partners have expressed strong interest in using some of the new starins in commercial production. Therefore it is anticipated that the novel fungal strains being generated will be of use in the food industry, either through licensing or a joint manufacturing agreement being set up.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C431C66A-AC58-4E2D-81AC-5ABB8AC58924</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447bc889438d1.80944478</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Designed new protocols for incubation of the fungus Penicillium roqueforti in an artifical milk model system to allow assessment of production of flavour volatiles linked to taste.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B303191-C9F2-42F8-B4BE-7177C13001A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The novel method has been found to be more reliable and quicker than an exisiting published method.
