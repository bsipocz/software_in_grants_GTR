Bangladesh has been in the midst of a rapid transition: disease burden has shifted markedly from a profile dominated by infectious diseases, under-nutrition and conditions of childbirth to one increasingly characterised by chronic disease (&amp;quot;non-communicable diseases&amp;quot;) such as heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, lung diseases, and cancer. Estimates suggest that at least 60% of adult deaths in Bangladesh today are due to such chronic diseases. 

As well as producing profound disabilities and cutting short millions of lives each year, the rise of chronic disease in Bangladesh has created major societal problems, limiting economic advancement, reducing human welfare, and skewing scarce resources toward costly treatments and away from social progress. This situation is unsustainable, especially as Bangladesh's population ages and continues to grow.

The causes of chronic disease in Bangladesh include distinctive social, environmental, and behavioural factors. For example, Bangladesh has one of the world's worst environmental and lifestyle risk profiles, characterised by:

Severe water and air pollution: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), arsenic-contaminated water in Bangladesh, which affects ~100M people, is &amp;quot;the largest mass poisoning of a human population in history&amp;quot;. A 2016 WHO report on ambient air pollution judged Bangladesh to be the fourth worst polluted country worldwide.

Nutritional disorders: Deficiencies of elements (such as iron) required for normal growth and development are widespread. An evolving and complex background of persisting undernutrition and emerging obesity also increase disease risks.

Risk behaviours: &amp;quot;Western&amp;quot; lifestyles (eg, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity) are increasing, and may amplify adverse effects of traditional risk behaviours, augmenting disease risk. 

These social, environmental, and behavioural risk factors tend to cluster in households, share antecedents and causes, amplify each other's effects, and depend on one another in complex (and non-obvious) ways. Importantly, they can also exert importantly different effects in differing contexts such as across rural, urban, and slum settings. Hence, approaches that could tackle such chronic disease risk factors in combination rather than in isolation are likely to be more powerful, as well as approaches that can take account of the context in which they occur. 

Yet, Bangladesh's research infrastructure is not configured to evaluate the country's multiple risks and multiple settings, perhaps preventing the emergence of evidence that could suggest &amp;quot;joined up&amp;quot; solutions. Our proposal aims to address this grand challenge. 

We will mobilise a multidisciplinary team of about 25 leading investigators from seven organisations in Bangladesh and the UK that have a substantial track-record of working together. We will adopt a wide-angle approach, focusing on intertwined risk factors for chronic disease that have not previously been considered in an integrated framework. The plan offers a fundamentally new approach to address this problem because it combines four innovative and inter-linked components:

1) Creation of a 100,000-participant study (&amp;quot;cohort&amp;quot;) in urban, rural, and slum areas to enable study of the social, environmental, and behavioural risk factors for chronic diseases.

2) Conduct of cross-disciplinary research projects that will use the new cohort help understand the interplay of risk factors, and how to combat them, drawing on the complementary strengths of sociologists, engineers, behavioural scientists, chemists, biostatisticians, public health scientists and others.

3) Delivery of an integrated programme of research capacity strengthening that targets three inter-linked levels of activity: individual, organisational, and institutional.

4) Mobilisation and deepening of partnerships between Bangladesh and UK centres of excellence.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In recent decades, Bangladesh has been in the midst of a rapid transition: disease burden has shifted markedly from a profile dominated by infectious diseases, under-nutrition and conditions of childbirth to one increasingly characterised by chronic disease (&amp;quot;non-communicable diseases&amp;quot;) such as heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, lung diseases, and cancer.

The ultimate desired impact of this initiative is a real-word sustainable gain in health (eg, material reduction in disability and/or prolongation of life), leading to improvements in human welfare and economic advancement in Bangladesh. 

We acknowledge that such an impact is unrealistic within a 4 year grant period, especially since the funding call requests &amp;quot;feasibility, scoping, exploratory, proof of concept studies&amp;quot; (rather than fullscale implementation trials).

Hence, key &amp;quot;intermediate&amp;quot; impacts to be achieved in the grant period through routes described in the Pathways to Impact statement include:

1) Systematic review, systems modelling, and proof of concept studies of several practicable, scalable and effective interventions that can help protect against NCDs, and understanding of their inter-dependencies, setting the stage for definitive separately-funded studies of interventions

Research findings from this project will be relevant to many aspects of the social, physical, and economic environment
We will contribute to the evidence in these areas and directly influence practice and policies at local, regional, national and international levels

2) A novel partnership between key Bangladeshi and UK organisations that will promote enduring relationships based on shared values and a common research agenda

Policy makers will benefit directly from the results of modelling and through using the models to consider different policy scenarios and assess proposed changes. The models will improve the ability to predict likely effects of interventions before deciding how to invest resources in real interventions, a major benefit for Bangladesh's resource-constrained authorities
We recognise that impact is a 2-way process, with our research priorities shaped by policy and public health needs, encouraging us to pursue a partnership approach, co-producing tools and publications and working closely with policymakers and public health practitioners.

3) A cross-disciplinary network of researchers, policy-makers, and other key stakeholders across the UK and Bangladesh committed to a shared research vision

Civil society organisations, NGOs, and campaigners represent other potential audiences for our evidence outputs and may present research opportunities
Our findings should provide better services and lead to a stronger evidence base for this implementation work (eg, BRAC WASH programmes).

4) Training of a cadre of several dozen applied researchers in Bangladesh and the UK capable of sustaining excellent research and effective action in the face of complexity, to combat adverse health effects of environmental exposures

5) A transformative100,000-participant multi-purpose research platform that can be enriched and harvested on an ongoing basis to inform policy and health practice in Bangladesh

The impact of this cohort could be analogous to the &amp;quot;cohorts/panels&amp;quot; created by the ESRC and MRC in the UK during the past 50 years; several have led to major research and societal advances, such as understanding of the relevance of social determinants of health (Whitehall cohort), the hazards of smoking (British Doctors' Study), and the prevention of cot death (ALSPAC)
This research platform will give the Bangladesh research and policy communities similar advantages to those accruing in other low- and middle-income countries that have created such cohorts suited to national circumstances, including China (500,000-participant Kadoorie Biobank) and Mexico (150,000-participant Mexico City Prospective Study).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8134239</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P02811X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>2472941E-25F2-45EC-A735-3C0872CE6B26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.3  Psychological, social and economic factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>9A8BEDCC-D902-4C9A-8CCF-C974265EA3FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.4  Surveillance and distribution</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>93C4699B-9E5C-4982-9CCC-EFD5B9712D6E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.6  Resources and infrastructure (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
