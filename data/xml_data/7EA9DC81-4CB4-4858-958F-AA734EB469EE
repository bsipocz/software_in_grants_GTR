models</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L018497/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>If we were to obtain the sequence of my genome, we'd see a string of three billion letters from the DNA alphabet. Now let's sequence yours and compare the two. At most positions they'd be identical - we are both human - but at a small number, less than 1%, we'd seem some variation. As the costs of DNA sequencing fall, obtaining your own genome will soon no longer be a hypothetical question. We are presently on the cusp of obtaining the genomes of thousands of people, providing a glimpse into the complex pattern of genetic variation across all humans. This data encodes a great deal of biological information such as the rate of mutations, and it also contains information about human demographic history, such as recent historical population size changes and migrations. Can we infer these things just from the genetic data?

Given its rich and complex source of data, this has occupied statisticians, probabilists, and geneticists for many years. The key to this type of statistical inference is a suitable stochastic model: one important model is known as the Wright-Fisher diffusion. It describes the random fluctuations through time of the frequency of a variant in a large population - that is, it traces a trajectory for how prevalent the variant was at each point in time. Performing inference with diffusion models can be difficult. The purpose of this research is to contribute to making such inference tractable.

The approach here is to use a computationally-intensive, simulation-based, statistical technique: rather than work exhaustively, we simulate some random, representative samples from the model and average over them. A computer can provide us with a large number of samples, so that the error is expected to be small provided we wait long enough. So successful is this idea that it is used throughout science and engineering. Here, we must simulate paths from the Wright-Fisher diffusion - the random, unobserved trajectories of historical frequencies of genetic variants. Ensuring such simulation can be carried out efficiently on this and related diffusions is a first task of the research. Because of the generality of the models and the techniques involved, this has the potential to aid researchers in many fields outside genetics too.

Given a method for sampling from the model, our next task is to embed it into an inference algorithm. However, this approach has been little applied to the framework of the Wright-Fisher diffusion, and there are open questions on the design of such an algorithm that this research will address, including some important specific issues. For example, we might simulate our diffusion path by many small, local increments, building up its trajectory in very small time steps based on what the data looks like at that time. We should hope that these trajectories will be consistent with the observed data overall, but ensuring such consistency is a global, not local, problem. The project will also address this issue.

Finally, we must specialize the algorithms for the analysis of genetic data. So that the work can be made accessible, convenient software will also be developed. Analysis of genetic data has the potential to provide a range of benefits: among other things, we can learn about human origins from ancient DNA, the evolution of pathogens, the progression of a tumour, the importance of natural selection, and the recent demographic history of humans. The latter is important as a vital first step in predicting the nature of human genetic variation, which in turn is fundamental in our understanding of the genetic basis of the risk of many complex diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Efficient means to interpret genetic data accurately are widely sought, and occupy the work of many research groups. Cutting-edge statistical techniques are available, but how can we ensure they are practical when applied to this type of data? This question is a strong motivation for the current project. In addressing it, extensive use will be made particularly of the tools of Sequential Monte Carlo and diffusion models. Each of these tools is rather versatile and arises in a number of applications: for example, diffusions are used in modelling stock prices, turbulence, and chemical reactions; Sequential Monte Carlo finds similarly diverse use such as in target tracking, volatility of financial instruments, and predicting polypeptide conformations. Progress made by specialists in these areas is often highly informative for the other areas. This research programme has been designed so that contributions here can be transferred to other applications in a straightforward manner, and benefit these groups across potentially broad areas.

Beyond this broad set of practitioners, the project considers the impact of these methodological developments by directly addressing inference problems for two specific types of data arising in genetics: first, genetic data in time-series form, which is entering a new era and now arises in several contexts; and second, a widely used genomic summary statistic known as the allele frequency spectrum. Progress in each of the two frameworks has the potential to directly benefit several groups:

- Improved understanding of time-series data will benefit those working on human origins with ancient DNA, the spatial spread of diseases, pathogen evolution, and the progression of a tumour sampled over several timepoints. Methods developed here can assist in dating when a genetic variant arose, infer whether a genomic region confers a selective advantage, and trace the geographic origin of a disease, for example.

- Understanding allele frequency spectrum data is important to many biologists, geneticists, and medical statisticians; for example, accurate inference of human demographic history using this type of data is, as well as being of direct interest, a first step in predicting the relative abundances of rare and common genetic variants in a population. This in turn is fundamental in our understanding of the genetic basis of complex disease risk.

Concentrated effort and resources by many researchers on these and related questions are likely to have a substantial impact on quality of life in the medium- to long-term, particularly as genomic data becomes available directly to the general public. If the project developed here is successful then, by contributing to this endeavour, it will encompass many potential indirect beneficiaries. The key aim in realizing this impact pathway is to ensure that results of the work are known and easily implemented by the above practitioners in other fields.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>92889</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Nuffield Department of Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>University of Oxford</gtr:description><gtr:id>052D627B-2263-4FAF-9BEC-F8E111AFFA7D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One publication: Griffiths, R.

1. Inference from multi-locus DNA sequence data must account for recombination, a biological process which is essential to our understanding of patterns of genetic variation. Modelling recombination is notoriously difficult, but we showed that under certain mild assumptions it is possible to obtain closed-form results for model likelihoods, including a complete description of an underlying diffusion model (Jenkins et al., 2015). This raises further questions for future research about related quantities like 'linkage disequilibrium', which is central to the recent widespread successes of association mapping, and whose distribution might offer further insights into our understanding of the genetic basis of numerous common, complex diseases.
2. A diffusion model could be regarded as 'solved' if we know its transition function: given the current frequency of a genetic variant, what is the distribution of its frequency a time t from now? Like most interesting diffusions, the transition function of the Wright-Fisher diffusion, a model of central importance arising in genetics, is not known in general. However, we have obtained the first ever analytic results for the transition function of the Wright-Fisher diffusion in a model with recombination (Griffiths et al., 2016). Furthermore, in Jenkins &amp;amp; Spano (2017) we solved the simulation problem for the Wright-Fisher diffusion: We showed that it is possible to simulate the Wright-Fisher diffusion exactly without any form of discretization of time and/or space. It raises the possibility for future work that other hitherto intractable diffusion models may be amenable to exact simulation.
3. We demonstrated the importance of the notion of time reversal with respect to inference from genetic data and several other statistical problems (Koskela et al., 2017). We discovered notable gains in computational efficiency using a technique called Sequential Monte Carlo for inference in a variety of problems including both genetic and non-genetic diffusions, queuing models, and epidemics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>All of the work resulting from this project has been disseminated at the appropriate levels: each article is available through arXiv and the PI's website, and has been (or is planned to be) submitted to journals from a variety of disciplines. Funds from this grant also facilitated the hosting of a three-day workshop on population genetics. This has helped disseminate the findings of this research, answering some questions and raising others likely to be of interest to other academics. It is also hoped that these steps have made the methods we have developed more accessible. It is intended that software under development by the PI and collaborators will be made available so that a variety of non-specialists can easily perform statistical inference on genomic data as part of their own wider analyses, with potential to assist in association mapping studies, studies of ancient DNA, pathogen evolution, and so on.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D89CD5D7-B2F4-4A49-9629-AAB179444C7E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54638e404764d0.92137539</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7B8D3E28-DA03-49C5-AE2B-5AEE01515EE8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tractable diffusion and coalescent processes for weakly correlated loci</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Electronic Journal of Probability</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/12f29bb591181bdc86a053cdccd46b5f"><gtr:id>12f29bb591181bdc86a053cdccd46b5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fearnhead P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675fde52af7f</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>676E8689-C469-479D-97CF-B5F575FA6D91</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coalescent Inference Using Serially Sampled, High-Throughput Sequencing Data from Intrahost HIV Infection.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7e668225d12897f19f5ec81fbd5bc04e"><gtr:id>7e668225d12897f19f5ec81fbd5bc04e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dialdestoro K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0016-6731</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d5c80e900394.18398141</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>738DC008-0969-463E-8B2F-048FEAD666CD</gtr:id><gtr:title>A coalescent dual process for a Wright-Fisher diffusion with recombination and its application to haplotype partitioning.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theoretical population biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ce572c53f19dc2567295652d12d027fe"><gtr:id>ce572c53f19dc2567295652d12d027fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Griffiths RC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0040-5809</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b7d0558c5266.46908064</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7E28D365-F7B0-4EAA-9800-B8B29F2A4889</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inference and rare event simulation for stopped Markov processes via reverse-time sequential Monte Carlo</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Statistics and Computing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/39bd3cbf803487c2dadec2b4e32acfdf"><gtr:id>39bd3cbf803487c2dadec2b4e32acfdf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Koskela J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b7d19ca0db57.67636971</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6E5DFC4-9752-4B59-8EA0-9AA8AD38880C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exact simulation of the Wright-Fisher diffusion</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annals of Applied Probability</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/217f681d1cba5c578b165d479c722b8e"><gtr:id>217f681d1cba5c578b165d479c722b8e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jenkins PA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58b7d148e95235.02242503</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2626AAE0-1AAE-4038-8F61-0B2D578D42B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bayesian non-parametric inference for $\Lambda$-coalescents: Posterior consistency and a parametric method</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Bernoulli</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/39bd3cbf803487c2dadec2b4e32acfdf"><gtr:id>39bd3cbf803487c2dadec2b4e32acfdf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Koskela J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a86c20f6c85d4.52012421</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L018497/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
