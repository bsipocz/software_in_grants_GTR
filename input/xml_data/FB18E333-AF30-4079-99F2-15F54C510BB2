Little is known about how microplastics enter the environment, their behaviour once there and the potential for ecosystem-scale effects. It is understood that microplastics can cause ecological harm under certain circumstances, but the long-term effects of this are as-yet unknown. Since research into microplastics began in 2004, the field of research has grown significantly, but many questions about presence, sources and effects still remain. To address these questions, it has been recognised that interdisciplinary effort is required. Stakeholders are beginning to hold targeted meetings to identify skill needs, technical capabilities and development of ideas, however the outcomes of these meetings are not widely disseminated and thus outreach is limited. There is therefore a need for coordination between stakeholder groups to allow for more efficient exchange of knowledge and inter-disciplinary discussions. I am a regular attendee at relevant meetings and, as such, I am aware of the gaps impeding communications between groups and can see clearly how connections can be built. Inter-stakeholder communications are especially important in the face of emerging policies and regulations that will affect governmental bodies and commercial businesses (e.g. water companies). 
This fellowship will allow me to interact with, and unite, a wide range of stakeholders to determine how best to address the concerns and interests of all parties (government, commercial, NGOs, academics), while allowing for relevant and mutually beneficial research to be undertaken. To understand microplastics as a pollutant, enormous research effort is needed to ascertain the ways in which they might have environmental, ecological and societal effects. The formation of a network would allow development of research ideas using a participatory approach to determine what knowledge best supports their requirements and what their customers or funders are willing (and motivated) to support. This integrated approach will allow for valuable development of the research field, allowing reciprocal relationships to be built.
Based on the identified discrepancies between the knowledge required and ongoing research, this fellowship also aims to produce guidance documents and reports, pitched at different levels for accessibility across the range of stakeholders, to disseminate relevant information on microplastics and address recognised inconsistencies in the research. This will include a review of the current state of the knowledge, in addition to a methodological guidance report and informative leaflets. Outputs produced will be disseminated in a variety of ways including via a mailing list, a Wiki page, social media and stakeholder websites, as appropriate depending on the publication.
As the leading UK council for environmental research NERC is already funding a number of microplastics projects ranging from PhD projects to large-scale multi-partner projects (e.g. assessing the fate of microplastics derived from industrial and domestic products in the waste water treatment process, Highlight Topic: nanoplastics, bioavailability and biological effects of microscopic plastic debris in the ocean). Within recent years, NERC has developed a reputation for high-quality research in this field. However, without the appropriate dissemination, the results of these projects will not reach the broader non-academic audience that might benefit from the data. 
In summary, this fellowship will bring together stakeholders to raise awareness of the knowledge and communication needs surrounding microplastics. This network will open up dialogue surrounding the issues that need to be addressed, identify how best to address these (leading to application), strengthen and develop communications between stakeholders and ultimately lead to economic benefits for all stakeholders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29871</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R003904/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6A654DB9-716E-4BAC-867B-E1CE45A994F6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecotoxicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC6B2467-35B6-4997-9582-1BF957B82697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>96F70ACB-D35F-416F-9360-4EFD402DFA6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Soil science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>99C0726F-47B0-4500-8B73-4DD0C60E31DF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Water Quality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
