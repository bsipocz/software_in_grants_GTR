Romance</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/H00839X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Before the fifteenth century, Middle English writers wrote stories in verse. The three broad streams of narrative verse in medieval England are the poetry of Chaucer and his followers, alliterative verse, and the metrical romances. The oldest of these, King Horn (c1220) immediately exposes our ignorance about the kind of verse the poet of Middle English romance thought they were writing. The Horn poet's rhyme range was evidently wider than that of poets such as Chaucer and Gower, and his prosody remains the subject of controversy: were his verses short couplet lines in alternating three-beat rhythm or more like the half-lines of alliterative poetry? A number of romances composed after Horn give rise to similar problems of scansion and versification. Sir Tristrem, from the later thirteenth century, was written in an unusual 11-line bob-and-wheel stanza that has seemed to some parodic and to others lyrical. To judge which of these views is the correct one, we would need to know which other poems (in English, Anglo-Norman and Latin) used the form. Two stanzaic patterns recur regularly in Sir Tristrem but a third pattern is only attested in just two stanzas: are these anomalous stanzas due to scribal invovement or are they authorial? This project addresses these and other questions by investigating the particular metrical systems that obtained in the Middle English romances, and it explores their textual and literary history to answer the question of what their verse forms meant to poets, scribes, and audiences. \n\nThe importance of these topics to editors, literary critics, and philologists has long been appreciated in the field of Chaucer studies and more recently in the field of alliterative verse, where new discoveries about poets' metrical practices have revolutionized editing and enriched literary criticism. Regrettably, the renewal of interest in the formal aspects of verse has largely passed the Middle English romances by. Since little is known about their metrical systems, editors have not been able to use metrical criteria as an aid to textual criticism, with the result that romances often circulate in editions that give the misleading impression that, where rhyme, stanza form, and rhythm are concerned, everything goes. There are good reasons, on the contrary, for assuming that romance poets had a determinate range of metrical possibilities, and that these conditions of metricality are recoverable. The accidental survival of autograph copies of Sir Ferumbras (consisting of fragmentary draft and a final version) provides a rare opportunity to measure the poet's range of permissible rhymes and rhythms. In romances that are extant in multiple copies (such as Horn and Eglamour), the unreliable evidence of scribal manuscript witnesses, invariably corrupted by error, can be checked against the evidence provided by other witnesses. \n\nThe potential benefits of this programme of research are wide-ranging. For example, our publications and CD and DVD recordings of illustrative readings from the metrical romances will enable modern readers to familiarize themselves with forgotten conventions of rhyme and rhythm; a knowledge of these conventions will help editors when weighing up the reliability of particular manuscript readings; and the data we seek to collect about imprecise rhymes and rhythmical patterns will be of permanent value for linguistic research into pronunciation, sound changes, and the perceptual salience of phonological distinctions.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The two main non-academic beneficiaries are the secondary school sector on the one hand and local communities and the wider general public on the other. To make our findings accessible to both constituencies, we have teamed up with the Chaucer Studio, co-directed by Paul Thomas (Brigham Young University) and Tom Burton (University of Adelaide). The Chaucer Studio recordings are widely used not only in Universities but also in schools to bring medieval literature to life. The success of the Chaucer Studio enterprise (see http://creativeworks.byu.edu/chaucer/) shows that there is both a market and an interested audience for audio-recordings; and since the objects of our investigation, rhyme and rhythm, are dimensions of sound, the proposed CD and DVD recordings are also well suited to our larger pedagogic agenda, which is to educate modern ears as well as minds. \n\n1) the secondary school sector\n\nIn the secondary school sector the main beneficiaries are pupils studying Middle English (usually Chaucer) at A-level and their teachers. Exposure to the sound of the Middle English language adds a new dimension to their experience of medieval poetry. University teachers of English Literature regularly give talks at schools, colleges, and summer schools. The proposed CD and DVD recordings will facilitate that work, and Putter and Jefferson will themselves using them as teaching aids in sessions to be offered as part of the University's annual outreach programme in 20012-2013. Within the general area of English Literature, the University of Bristol engages with local communities as part of its Lifelong Learning programmes. Previous courses have included day schools tailored especially for the visually impaired, run in collaboration with the University's Access Unit. The English Department also runs a new part-time BA programme in English Literature and Public Engagement: students taking this BA run seminars and reading classes with local communities in public libraries. This infrastructure gives us the capability of reaching a broader range of audiences. Two day courses on the Middle English romances are planned in the final project year. One of these day courses is intended specifically for the visually impaired, who will find the audio-recordings especially beneficial. The recordings will also assist English Literature and Public Engagement BA students in running seminars on medieval literature in local libraries. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>357429</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Recording of Middle English romances, sung to music reconstructed on the basis of stanza forms</gtr:description><gtr:id>17CF65BD-88B7-40A4-BE95-7ACF79A967D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The double CD was released by the Chaucer Studio in 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5457b7da138a86.30545109</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>audio CD</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://creativeworks.byu.edu/chaucer/ViewItem.aspx?id=OR041&amp;language=&amp;medium=&amp;keyword=</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Sutton Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sutton Trust</gtr:description><gtr:id>2E4D1964-2E3A-4E8D-AA29-64E4D3491D59</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lecture on 'The Rhythms of English Verse'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5457a4d3b69904.40816387-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The video-conference technology and the technical support was made available through the University of Bristol Widening Access Team</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Through the Virtually University initiative the PI gave a video-conferenced talk on rhythm and versification to Loxford, Essex, Gumley House, London, Ilford High, essex, amd Sheffield Springs Academy.

The ME romances were originally intended to have wide popular appeal, cutting across divisions of class, age, and gender. The Middle English language now interposes a barrier, though in translation the romances still can and do appeal to a broad readership. Examples are Sir Orfeo, widely read in the translation by Tolkien (Harper Collins) and Sir Cleges, included in several anthologies of 'Christmas stories' for all ages. Although some aspects of our research were specialized and technical, we also staged sung performances of Middle English romances, and these were recorded as a double CD by the Chaucer Studio. These audio-recordings have provided suitable and attractive ways of making the verse-craft of the original poems accessible and relevant to a wider audience. They are also being used as teaching aids. The non-for-profit principles of the Chaucer Studio have increased the reach of their recordings, beyond the principal beneficiaries, teachers and lecturers and their students, to a wide cross-section of educated and interested people in all walks of life.
Along with our project partner, the Chaucer studio, we have also worked with the University of Bristol's Lifelong Learning and Outreach divisions to ensure that we realized the benefits of our research for the secondary education sector
Middle English texts are still widely taught in the A-level curriculum. For pupils studying, for example, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales for A-level, exposure to the sound-world of Middle English has been a revelation for secondary school students. We have given talks at local schools and colleges and Sutton trust summer schools. Our activities in this area are listed under 'engagement activities'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EDE88654-1074-4436-A34A-43DD057A7A44</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-6007777830.5930805de285106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The technique of stanza linking has been investigated. Its use across a wide range of poems (both courtly and popular) has been demonstrated. A paper on this topic was delivered by PI (see outputs): it will form a chapter of the eventual book, which we are in discussion about with CUP.

Based on the research on Sir Tristrem (which also uses stanza-linking incidentally) a detailed study of its rhyme schemes was undertaken. This both established that the original poet was precise and exacting in his rhymes; it also pointed to extensive re-writing by the scribe. On this basis we were able to show the scribal dialect was very different from the poet's, which we were able to localize to Yorkshire (see also outputs). 

We have also been able to trace the history of the unusual stanza form in Sir Tristrem. Advancing beyond current knowledge (McIntosh 1989). we have been able to document the use of the stanza form in Middle English drama and lyric, and more importantly to trace it back to and Anglo-Norman poem (in Harley 2253). The PI presented papers on this at the Medieval Song Network (see outputs). 

We have demonstrated the use of an unusual stanza form (abab) in four Middle English romances. We have found the stanza form to be popular rather than esoteric; it is one that has been used for centuries for sung material (e.g. ballads, nursery rhymes). In a paper and in talks by the Post-doc (see outputs), we have shown that the forms taken by the rhymes of the abab romances supports this assessment: the rhymes include a high proportion of partial rhymes involving consonant variation. Building on current linguistic work we have found that such consonant variation is typical of spoken rather than written verse. This has now been published in an article in Studies in Philology. 

Two further metrical forms have been examined: for romances in bob-and-wheel stanzas, as we have argued in a paper (forthcoming in 2015 book) interesting analogues may be found in cognate genres, such as the Verse Life of St John of Bridlington. A second form, rhymed stanzaic alliterative verse, was explored in a paper delivered by the PI on a conference at the Courtauld Institute: our research shows that Karl Luick's claim that the shorter lines divide are rhythmically speaking comparable to first-half lines in alliterative metre, except for the last, is doubtful. It appears in fact that the distinction between first-half and second-half metre, which was so crucial in the metre of unrhymed alliterative poetry, was being lost. 

Although the music of all Middle English romances has been lost, it has proved possible to use the melodies of lyrics in the same stanza form as a basis for sung performance. We have used a musical setting of a liturgical song (rhyming aaabab), of a Middle English song (Edu be thu) and an Anglo-Norman song (Eyns ne soy) as a basis for a sung performance. A recording of these, together with a sung performance of Sir Orfeo by Linda and Marie Zaerr, was made by the Chaucer Studio (April 2013) is now available on on a double CD distributed by the Chaucer Studio.

An international conference on medieval romance was organised at the University of Bristol, and a volume of proceedings on the metre and manuscripts of middle English romances is in progress.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We were able to make good use of our work on stanza linking in a lecture for the Sutton Trust, which seeks to improve educational opportunities for secondary school students from non-privileged backgrounds and to increase social mobility. Our lecture on 'The Sound and Sense of Middle English Romances (see outputs) was one of four lectures chosen by the Arts Faculty of our University for the 2012 Sutton Trust Lectures. We also offered a day course on the Sound and Sense of Medieval Romances (December 2013), which received excellent feedback questionnaires from an enthusiastic group of students. We have been asked to follow up the 2012 Stutton Trust Lecture with a longer seminar, which took take place at the University of Bristol on Monday 8th July. Together with the Widening Participation Division of the University of Bristol, the PI has also participated in the 'Virtually University' series, consisting of lectures which are broadcast, by video-conference, to participating schools who would like to give their students an experience of research at University level.

The PI has also given outreach lectures using project findings at schools.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C124E7D3-3A4C-48B4-BDE0-ABD70FEC0EFE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7238570747.187892779521b4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FFB8A098-2187-417A-B9CB-0DE3CDE90152</gtr:id><gtr:title>Perfect and Imperfect Rhyme: Romances in the abab Tradition</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Studies in Philology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b1ad86d8edf82e3a7a54a53f7dc9072c"><gtr:id>b1ad86d8edf82e3a7a54a53f7dc9072c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jefferson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675ece5aaf47</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>44EB07BE-D393-4CDF-8CAE-202541F9F260</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dialect, Rhyme, and Emendation in Sir Tristrem</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of English and Germanic Philology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b92ed532b35e8e41d2353de95352a00c"><gtr:id>b92ed532b35e8e41d2353de95352a00c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ad Putter</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54579f6e2642a8.20161281</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>959492D4-087D-47A0-B207-2E8312D9902B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dialect, Rhyme, and Emendation in
