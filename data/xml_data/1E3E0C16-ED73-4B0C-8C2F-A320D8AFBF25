However, there remains considerable uncertainty over the interactions between ocean and climate during abrupt transitions that are known to have occurred in the past. One such example is the rapid warming and sudden change in ocean circulation associated with the start of the Bolling-Allerod around 14.6 thousand years ago. The proxy-archives used to understand these shifts (including chemical ocean circulation tracers such as d18O, d13C, radiocarbon, Pa/Th and eNd) seems to disagree at times, suggesting that we are missing fundamental knowledge for interpreting this data. In addition, it remains unknown what chain of events led to these abrupt changes; were they forced by gradual changes in atmospheric CO2? Was a critical threshold crossed in ice-sheet dynamics, atmospheric physics or ocean circulation? To what extent were the concurrent shifts in atmospheric and oceanic processes linked, or were they entirely separate? With this limited understanding, we cannot know if similar rapid transitions could occur again in the near-future; our projections could be lacking crucial mechanistic understanding of climate and ocean dynamics.

Great advancements have recently been made in both the fields of palaeoclimate reconstruction and climate modelling. However, we are reaching the limits of what can be achieved by applying these specialist methods in relative isolation. I propose to make the next logical step and combine these fields of expertise in this fellowship. Using state of the art facilities, this fellowship aims to incorporate cutting-edge knowledge of ocean circulation proxies into some of the most powerful tools for understanding climate dynamics; high complexity atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, the same IPCC-class models that are used to make projections of future change. The exciting multi-proxy, multi-model approach is designed for robustness and to explore uncertainty in both the methods employed and the results produced. With these new multidisciplinary tools, I hope to not only answer specific questions such as 'what caused the abrupt Bolling-Allerod warming?' and 'was the deglacial ocean ever in a bistable mode?', but also to equip earth system scientists with an improved, more holistic understanding of climate-ocean interactions that can be applied to a range of timescales for past, present and future scenarios. 

This fellowship answers a call in the field of climate science for multidisciplinarity. The scientific community have expressed enthusiasm and excitement for the development of these tools, the expertise that I am training in and the chance to shift some of the existing paradigms of past climate-ocean dynamics. In order to achieve these goals, I have built a network of collaborators who are world leaders in their specific fields of research; Valdes and Otto-Bliesner in GCM modelling (respectively expert in the UM and CESM models), McManus in Pa/Th, Robinson in radiocarbon, Barker in d18O and d13C, Gutjahr in eNd and essentially, all collaborators have overlapping expertise. The collaborators have been involved in developing some of the hypotheses tested in this fellowship and will make world leading facilities available to me, helping to keep the project at the cutting-edge of current understanding. Their research groups will broaden my network and establish me as a high-profile, internationally-renowned researcher with unique and highly sought after expertise; the ideal foundation for crafting my own research group.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who:
This project aims to develop new tools for improving scientific understanding of abrupt climate change and ocean-climate dynamics, working within a multidisciplinary framework to improve our knowledge of climate projection uncertainty. The beneficiaries are many because this topic is a focus of the Earth system science research agenda and it holds great topical interest for the wider public as concerns grow about modern climate change. The project will deliver fundamental knowledge on the causes/consequences of past climate change, develop new modelling tools and improve cross-discipline channels of communication, benefitting a broad range of scientists, including model-developers and any individual/group with an interest in understanding mechanisms of climate change, reducing uncertainty in future climate projections and implementing policy to adapt to these changes. Therefore, postgraduates and undergraduates; model end-users (policy makers/stake holders); the scientifically-, socially- and politically-engaged general public; school teachers and pupils will also benefit from this research.

How:
Model developers worldwide, and particularly at the UK Met Office, will benefit from my isotope implementation into the UM and my assessment of its physical parametric uncertainty. This fellowship research will improve our understanding and analysis of model uncertainty and provide an improved framework for the effective and transparent transfer of knowledge to end users. This is a theme that I have been engaged with since the outset of my research career (see Ivanovic and Freer, 2009) and is one I am keen to bring to the fore in the future. The general public and schools will benefit from my continued leadership and participation in numerous outreach schemes, which to date has had several purposes: (i) to inspire, (ii) to open doors to higher education and academia, (iii) to make reported scientific findings accessible to the public, (iv) to shatter the black-box perception of the methodologies employed, (v) to dispel the illusions of scientists as 'them' or 'other' (vi) to educate. In addition, the public will have the opportunity to read about my work, should they wish.

Practical strategies to ensure the benefit:
1. Become a highly visible research leader and establish new international working groups to bring to the fore the multidisciplinary techniques I will employ.
2. Publish results, methodologies and model development code in high profile, peer-reviewed journals (open access wherever possible). 10 publications are anticipated.
3. Present work at 2 major, international conferences per year, in the departments I will be working in, as well as at other UK and international institutes.
4. Convene at least one session at Goldschmidt and one session at AGU Fall Meeting.
5. Make my model data freely available on a website with a non-specialist, user-friendly interface.
6. Create and maintain a wiki user-manual for running the UM with the geochemical ocean tracers I will implement.
7. Contribute towards a website with online resources for learning about science.
8. Employ mass; press releases targeting newspapers, television and other popular media outlets, e.g. NERC Planet Earth publication and podcasts.
9. Run a high profile public debate or panel discussion involving 6 experts (with different specialism) on the extent to which uncertainty in climate science fetters policy making in public and private domains. 
10. Integrate my research into undergraduate/postgraduate teaching and research project supervision.
11. Establish an innovative, multidisciplinary and expert research group.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>414696</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF29F79D-DA44-4543-956F-4CA741B9A686</gtr:id><gtr:title>The 8.2 ka cooling event caused by Laurentide ice saddle collapse</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5c993975e6b7ccc166383b914049e4c4"><gtr:id>5c993975e6b7ccc166383b914049e4c4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Matero I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc5fa626ee1.76369764</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>070B9410-AEE9-4EC0-89AF-8510B6795443</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transient climate simulations of the deglaciation 21-9&amp;nbsp;thousand years before
