It will transmit data in a wireless way and will provide early warnings for compromised welfare with recommended actions and will mitigate productivity losses. The implementation of the sensor will augment existing legislative and Industry Assurance requirements; providing real-time animal welfare monitoring it will create greater levels of Assurance to the consumer through Certification. This innovative product is a solution in direct response to growing consumer concerns about animal welfare and consequent health and safety of meat products, which has resulted in increasing regulations affecting poultry production livestock rearing conditions. Producers to now have to balance meeting regulations with increasing production demands, whilst maintaining a healthy profit.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Raising poultry for meat is a large industry which is highly regulated by government and quality assurance bodies, due to consumer concerns about animal welfare and health and safety of meat products. To help farmers meet such regulations a consortium has designed a product to monitor the welfare of chickens and the environmental conditions of barns in which they are housed. The consortium aims to turn the design of this all-in-one environmental and welfare monitoring system into a tried and tested product. The product will help farmers more closely monitor and respond to changes in chickens' environment or welfare. It will improve existing legal and quality assurance requirements by providing real-time monitoring and will provide up-to-date advice to farmers on how they can create better more productive environments for their chickens. This innovative product will help farmers to more easily comply with regulations, whilst improving welfare and maintaining a healthy profit.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project addresses the clear business opportunity of animal welfare (AW) and environmental paramater (EP) poultry precision livestock farming (PLF), providing producers with solutions to minimise losses (Cokery et al., 2013). Translating successful scientific studies in thermography, video image analysis and vocalisation into robust commercial products will benefit producers, consumers and industry. 70% of consumers are concerned with AW (BBFAW, 2012); 80% of ethical consumers are willing to pay more for certification. Hartman Group (2012) predicts increasing AW Certified product sales. Project industry data shall enable 'smart supply chains' causing better assurance compliance rates whilst reducing the 'paper cost' and resulting environmental impact of producing food (Wagner et al., 2002; SITPRO 2008). The global agricultural sensor market, shall reach $1.46 billion by 2018 with the growth of the Internet of Things and increased welfare, health and disease legislation (Markets and Markets, 2011). UK public fund investment would enable gains in this market, where Germany, the US and Asia are leaders. The current market opportunity for the final products sales is &amp;pound;384m (6 sensors ea@&amp;pound;200 p/barn-barns calculated from:FAO STAT, 2014). Pressure groups (WP8) and consortium members shall establish global distributor routes. Initial trial sales will begin 3 months prior project completion in the UK. Further hardware sales will occur in: UK year 1 (&amp;pound;500k),EU expansion year 2 (&amp;pound;1.3m), Australia &amp;amp; US expansion Year 3 (&amp;pound;2.6mill),worldwide expansion year 4 (&amp;pound;4.8mill). Year 2 (post project) sales will be further enhanced with software, Assurance Certification and Licencing models. Expansion from poultry to all livestock shall be investigated. This and GGL's go to market strategy across its expanding global distributor base shall be fuly funded by GGL, and supported by all other consortium members.The project will result in a minimum of 25 new employment opportunities acll partners, and opportunities for multiple patent applications.
The primary beneficiaries and users of this research are commercial poultry producers and those involved with this supply chain. By testing the technology in an existing farm which has strong links with J.Sainburys, there is already a clear link to the complete supply chain. The economic impact would be passed on to those who used the sensor developed as it would allow earlier detection and therefore intervention of welfare issues which also translate to increased productivity. Economic losses in IPPU would be abated as early stress within poultry flocks would be detected and responded to. A sensor system will reduce wastage associated with commercial poultry production by enabling poultry producers and retailers to respond to productivity reductions and wastage. A more efficient system which loses fewer chickens to pre-slaughter mortality reasons would mean fewer animals are needed, which, in addition to having inherent positive ethical value, could also assist with reducing CO2 emissions from IPPUs. There would be a benefit to retailers and to wider society to allow better monitoring of chicken welfare and to better provide for consumer led choices to purchase high welfare poultry products. Through enabling retailer awareness of animal welfare standards within producer barns, high end value retailers are able to, not only communicate these results confidently to consumers, but also make knowledgeable choices about which producers to use. This shall further increase the opportunity for farmers to respond to animal welfare standards within their production barns as retailers are able to knowledgeably choose their producers based on these standards.
The UoN is a leading academic institution within the Agri-food industry and this actively attracts UK and overseas students. Involvement in this high profile project will further promote capability, which will support student recruitment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>347258</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talks (Newcastle)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DBCA4610-A11A-4D08-9184-5848FE079A16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three presentations have been given at the University to cross-disciplinary audiences including undergraduate and postgraduate researchers.

We are trialling this further to ensure this is possible on a real farm. We also have proof of concept that we can track chickens activity and clustering using thermal images, but again need to test this in a real farming context. We have identified four different types of calls which chickens make using recording equipment and intend to evaluate if more or less of these occur when chickens are in different welfare states.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are being further researched but will be incorporated into a chicken welfare sensor system by our industrial partners. The findings are communicated with industry through our industrial partner, Campden BRI who provide links between academia, research and the food industry. The eventual goal of the sensor is to assist with welfare monitoring and provision. It will also be possible to develop similar methods for other species or farming contexts and to this end further grants in this area are being explored.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E8D30461-F53C-4AE0-BADD-6FA0029EE7AF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e156a45fc381.96366726</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have established that thermal images can be used to assess feather coverage in meat chickens.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6897B1A3-282C-4E46-BE07-989939B90A7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This method will reduce handling of birds for feather coverage assessment, this has welfare and biosecurity benefits</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e1764b345329.04249764</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Thermal imaging for assessing feather cover</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N010361/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D5C57767-F44D-42BE-B074-C153A3C8EEA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Welfare</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A2A69ED-37ED-4980-91A7-E54B4F6A9BC6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C7A88EDD-F02E-4CF4-B7E9-E33C946EBD49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
