integration and modeling, that can be used and will be tested by our industrial partners. The
approach is generic and therefore of general use in industrial biotechnology. No patents are
expected from the modeling methodology per se, but as it is a powerful enabling technology for
biological discovery and innovation, there might be IP on optimization strategies. More directly,
findings for specific or general strain and/or process development of the succinic acid process, or
more general yeast fermentation might be achieved.

Preliminary exploitation plan - knowledge and expertise developed in this project, as well as
software and models, will be valuable assets for follow up in public-private partnerships. Software
will be developed under open-source agreement for academic use. None of the academic partners
have the ambition at this moment to set up a company to provide modeling services. All groups
involved have a large network with industrial partners to team up with to implement and apply the
developed technologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>271256</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>DSM</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>ERA-IB yeast proteomics and turnover studies</gtr:description><gtr:id>DEBC60FA-20F5-4EBE-8364-D3355EA3DE41</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project is in its early days but we now have acquired quantitiative proteomics data via the Liverpool partners and have improved our data analysis pipelines for estimation of protein turnover rates</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df4489306db4.64166069-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provision of expertise in modelling, with industrial partners providing industrially important yeast strains which are able to produce high yields of succinate.
