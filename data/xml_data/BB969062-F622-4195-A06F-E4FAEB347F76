The reduction of Arctic sea ice is more rapid and extreme than climate models predict, suggesting that these models do not adequately represent the processes controlling this reduction. 
 The reduced summer Arctic sea ice cover, and changes to the winter sea ice cover, affect the mechanical and thermodynamic coupling between the air and ocean. In fact, observations show that the sea ice cover has become more mobile in the last 15 years and that there has been an increase in the mean ocean circulation beneath the sea ice. Since, over the same period, there has not been an observed increase in wind strength, this suggests that changes to the sea ice cover itself are responsible for an enhanced ice motion and transfer of wind stress to the ocean beneath sea ice.
 Our project hypothesis is: Changes in the Arctic sea ice cover have resulted in a more efficient transfer of momentum between the air and ocean, resulting in spin up of sea ice and the Arctic Ocean. We will test this hypothesis with a combination of new data, theory and numerical modelling.
 We will investigate how changes in the roughness of the ice cover, e.g. through a more dilute ice cover having more floe edges exposed, change the drag forces exerted by the air on the ice and the ice on the ocean. We will investigate how a reduction in the ice cover may reduce the resistance of the ice cover to the wind, allowing it to move more easily. In particular we address the question: to what extent is acceleration of the Arctic sea ice gyre the result of decreased ice forces versus increased drag?
 We will use climate models containing new physics calibrated with, and derived from, new observations, to examine the prediction that: Changes in the sea ice cover will continue to lead to enhanced momentum transfer between the air and ocean, resulting in a more mobile and responsive ice cover and enhanced flow and mixing in the Arctic Ocean.
 Although we focus our analysis on the Arctic Ocean, where sea ice changes have been more dramatic, we will also examine air-ice-ocean momentum exchanges in the Southern Ocean.
 This proposal brings together leading researchers in sea ice dynamics, remote sensing, ocean and climate modelling, and builds upon existing expertise in satellite observation, theory, and modelling of sea ice in the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling. 
 In addition to the scientific outcomes, the proposed work will result in new sea ice drag physics being incorporated into a sea ice climate model and delivered to climate modelling groups. This will directly help scientists investigating and predicting future changes to the sea ice cover in the Arctic and Southern Oceans and also help scientists trying to understand and predict changes in the global climate system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Arctic sea ice reduction has become a totemic indicator of climate change with impacts on iconic species such as polar bears and the Beluga whale, as well as indigenous human populations. The reduction of Arctic sea ice extent has generated widespread interest with numerous articles in the popular press, radio, television and internet. 
Reduction in the sea ice cover is already opening up shipping routes and the potential for oil exploration has generated political statements and actions including, for example, the placement of the Russian flag at the North Pole and Denmark's declaration of sea bed rights up to the North Pole. Lloyd's of London, with Chatham House, published a report called &amp;quot;Arctic Opening&amp;quot; in 2012, with business (including insurance) expansion in mind. A Royal Society meeting on Arctic sea ice: the evidence, models, and global impacts is being organised by the PI in September 2014.
Continued reduction of the sea ice cover is expected to cause enhanced ocean mixing with a consequent impact on water mass transformation and supply of nutrients to the euphotic zone, which are necessary for primary production. The change in ocean and ice is expected to have implications for climate in NW Europe.
A major practical impact of this proposal is in the generation of a more realistic treatment of air to ice to ocean momentum transfer by form drag in the sea ice component of several climate models. The new treatment of air-sea ice-ocean momentum transfer will affect regional ice predictions used to inform government policy and those with financial and societal interest, such as the insurance, shipping and oil industries, as well as Inuit community groups. 
The new treatment of form drag will also lead to improved climate prediction studies, used to guide national and international policy on issues related to climate change.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56135</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>IceBridge data processing</gtr:description><gtr:id>0871E696-25B7-4FA5-A627-D62618722830</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A paper is under revision in the Cryosphere &amp;quot;http://www.the-cryosphere-discuss.net/tc-2015-199/&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e04dde7f2273.62153723-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners have provided state of the art remote sensing data from the ongoing NASA Operation IceBridge project that was devised to bridge the gap between the two NASA satellite missions ICESAT and ICESAT2</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have contributed in the processing of the data.

- In a publication in JGR 'The impact of variable sea ice roughness on changes in Arctic Ocean surface stress: A model study' we found that the new form drag parameterization developed by CoI Michel Tsamados has the potential to modify significantly the momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean in the Arctic. In fact when switched on the new parameterization results in a negative trend of the Arctic basin integrated total momentum transfer over the satellite period (1979-2016) while when the parameterization is switched off the trend is positive. We have been able using a state of the art sea ice model to show that this is related to the smoothing of the ice associated to its overall thinning
