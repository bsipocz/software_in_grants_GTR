York has invested over &amp;pound;500M in world-class resources to support these activities, rating 10th for research impact in the 2014 national Research Excellence Framework exercise. Our EPSRC DTP supports world leading research across Chemistry, Computer Science, Electronics, Mathematics and Physics departments. Our research is highly interdisciplinary and projects are often carried out in collaboration with other departments, such as Biology or Environment, where these intersect with EPSRC cross-cutting themes. Departments are also able to take advantage of local centres of excellence, such as Green Chemistry, Mass Spectrometry, Complex Systems Analysis and Magnetic Resonance, as well as established industry collaborations and ongoing major projects such as the Digital Creativity and Quantum Communications Hubs, and the Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI; http://www.iggi.org.uk/) and Fusion http://www.york.ac.uk/fusion-cdt/) CDTs. The approach of the DTP is supported by, and complementary to, the University Research Strategy themes of 'Risk, Evidence and Decision Making' (http://www.york.ac.uk/research/themes/risk/), and 'Technologies For The Future' (http://www.york.ac.uk/research/themes/technologies-for-the-future/). Ongoing and future project areas include Plasma Physics and Fusion, Pure Mathematics, Mathematical Biology, Intelligent Systems, Quantum Computing and Atmospheric Chemistry. All postgraduate researchers are members of the York Graduate Research School (http://www.york.ac.uk/research/graduate-school/), which supports our community of over 2,000 research students from the UK and around the world as they pursue their research. The School coordinates resources from across the University to help students achieve successful outcoes, ensuring that they receive the highest quality supervision and training, &amp;amp; providing extensive communication skills development to help students complement their specialist research skills. 
The University provides a broad, postgraduate researcher-focused programme of training mapped to the national Researcher Development Framework, covering areas such as Research Integrity, Public Engagement &amp;amp; Personal Development, to all students. In addition, departments offer bespoke training such as the Innovative Doctoral Training in Chemistry (iDTC; Chemistry), York Doctoral Symposium (Computer Science), LaTeX and Matlab (Electronics), and MAGIC (Mathematics Access Grid Instruction and Collaboration). These programmes ensure our DTP students are fully supported in their study &amp;amp; prepared for the next stage of their career. 
Full details of ongoing and available research projects can be seen in the postgraduate section of each department's website:

More than 20 DTP-funded positions are available at York each year across Chemistry, Computer Science, Electronics, Mathematics and Physics. Departments are informed of the number of studentships available during the summer term, &amp;amp; information on available research projects is published on departmental websites by early autumn. For 2017 entry, projects will be open for application from October 2016. Applications are made through an online system (http://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/apply/) and students will be invited to the relevant department for an interview. Offers of places are made during the subsequent spring term. The University actively promotes diversity &amp;amp; equality across all departments, with an Equality Champions Network, Athena Swan awards held by all EPSRC-supported departments, and Physics recognised as a 'Juno Champion' department.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4067668</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509802/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
