It includes the printmakers' proofs of the illustrations to Lewis Carroll's 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' (1865, fig. 1), as well as the Pre-Raphaelite illustrations to Tennyson's 'Mariana' and 'The Lady of Shalott' (1857, fig. 2), objects of immense importance to visual and literary culture. Despite their huge achievements, there has never been a full-length study of the Dalziels. Instead, scholars tend to focus on the designers of the images, artists who made the preparatory pencil drawings before the blocks were engraved: for the illustrations mentioned above, John Tenniel, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais. This project investigates the Dalziels and their radically collaborative methods of commissioning and engraving works of art. It asks who the Dalziels were, examining the little acknowledged contributions of women family-members and anonymous employees. 
The Dalziels had great cultural power at a key moment in history, as Britain's largest publishers of printed images - everything from Dickens and Trollope illustrations to scientific images of molluscs and calf foetuses (fig. 7), and adverts for soap or cocoa. This was a time when wood engraving was the ubiquitous technique. Invented in the early 19th century, wood engraving was different from the earlier woodcut; cut on boxwood (an extremely hard wood), and using the endgrain rather than plank, it was capable of much finer detail, so that it could compete technically with copper and steel engravings. It was also far cheaper to print. Like no other visual medium then known, wood engraving was capable of extraordinary detail combined with cheap mass production (for most of the century photography was too expensive for widespread use). My project investigates the role of the Dalziels at the head of this industry, and the nature of their cultural influence.
My primary research material is the Dalziel Archive. Held in the British Museum, this vital but scarcely used resource has proof impressions of all Dalziel images, collected in albums from 1839 to 1893. As engravers' proofs, they were printed with care, often finer than published impressions. The albums are astonishing for the visual qualities, not only of the famous highlights mentioned above, but of many stunning prints never before exhibited. For example, the archive includes an arresting illustration, 'Rizpah' (1857, fig. 3), engraved by the Dalziels after Tenniel. It shows a bereaved mother from the Old Testament, her haggard face brilliantly lit, who stares bleakly at at the viewer from a gothic landscape. Exhibiting and interpreting images like this for the first time since they were produced, I will offer a much-needed account of wood engraving that explores its techniques and aesthetic. I will also make a new intervention in our theoretical understanding of how text and illustrations relate to one another.
This two-year project invests in my career development, as well as in this important new research area. It will enable me to develop vital skills as a research leader, managing an interdisciplinary project with multiple collaborators for the first time. I will publish a monograph exploring the Dalziel family, and the way book illustrations were read and used in the 19th century and beyond. I will curate a display in the British Museum which explores the same themes. A conference will allow for shared research, bringing together different intellectual perspectives. An illustrated, online catalogue, to be published on the British Museum's website, will make the Dalziels' work accessible for this first time. Finally, I will lead a series of open critical and creative workshops that will introduce the Dalziels to new audiences and promote new ways of responding to their art.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Outside academia, the people I anticipate will primarily benefit from the research are: museum curators, visual artists, creative writers, and readers of 19th-century literature. Secondary groups who will benefit include school teachers, pupils, and museum visitors, especially those interested in printmaking and Victorian culture.
Museum staff will benefit because the research proposes a new way of working with and understanding their collection. My monograph will be an essential reference work for staff working with the Dalziel Archive. The online catalogue produced as part of the research will be a vital tool for museum staff who wish to increase accessibility to this important collection. In collaborating with curators to produce a museum display on the Dalziels, I will be promoting an unknown aspect of their collection and adding to the exhibiting culture of the musuem. My literary expertise will be of particular value within the museum; it is essential to understanding the Dalziel Archive, which is currently housed in an environment strongly aligned to the discipline of art history. 
Visual artists, and in particular contemporary designers and printmakers, will benefit from the way the project thinks through the history of artisanship, and opens access to an important historic collection. Artisans today, thinking about their own status as creators negotiating in a capitalist society, will benefit from this recovery of the history of the Dalziels and their employees. The Dalziels' albums were made as tools for working artists, and by running a workshop on how they can be re-used today, I hope to re-ignite their relevance for our own visual culture. I will reach this group through a targeted workshop (run with Nancy Campbell, editor of Printmaking Today), and through the museum display, online catalogue and blog.
Creative writers, especially those interested in historical fiction, will benefit from the chance to work with an unparalleled collection of visual art from the 19th century, with everything from mundane diagrams of Victorian taps and fitness training postures, to little known fairytales or high literary illustration. The Dalziel Archive particularly lends itself to writing since so much of it is untraced illustration, that was specifically designed to accompany texts that are now unknown. For example, the numerous pictorial capital letters that are dispersed throughout the collection (e.g. fig. 10) will mostly never be re-connected with their original publications, and in that disassociation they become free to be used by creative writers today. I will work with novelist Rebecca Stott (UEA) to run a workshop specifically for writers, whom I will also reach through my blog and museum display.
Local reading groups will benefit from the opportunity to think about new ways of reading loved Victorian novels and poetry. The Dalziel Archive offers a completely new way of thinking about writers such as Dickens, Trollope, Tennyson and Carroll. I will run a workshop with Luisa Cal&amp;egrave; (Birkbeck) who is an expert on book history and embodied reading practices, and we will explore how 19th-century illustrations and albums take apart and re-make Victorian texts. Again, this is supported by the blog, catalogue and display.
More widely the project could benefit others such as local teachers and pupils, especially since the archive includes an excellent collection of children's literature. I will contact schools to invite them to use the exhibition and blog. Beyond this, the project's activities address other interested groups, such as physical and virtual museum visitors. Gallery 90, where my display will be held, attracts between 500 and 2200 visitors daily, and the British Museum's online database attracts 1.3 million pageviews per month. Such visitors will benefit from my research and will find links to the project blog where they can participate further.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>149997</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of the engagement activities developed during this award we have worked with several creative writers and visual artists who have made new artworks inspired by the project's workshops, research, website and database.

I have written online catalogue entries for 42 out of 49 albums that comprise the Dalziel Archive, a major and under-used collection of 54,000 wood engravings held in the British Museum. My catalogue summarises the historical and material knowledge of each album, as discovered in my primary research. Entries vary, but each of the 42 entries is approximately 1,000 words long, and synthesises key information on the prints contained in the albums. My catalogue is published on the British Museum database, Collections Online (more information is given in the section 'Databases and Models'). I will continue adding to my entries in the course of the project, as new information is discovered, and at a later stage in the project I will work to promote this catalogue e.g. via the project blog. 
Working with Sylph Editions, I have provided high quality photographs of every page of every album in the Dalziel Archive, amounting to around 16,000 photographs (more information on different aspects of this output is given in the sections 'Databases and Models', 'Intellectual Property and Licensing' and 'Artistic and Creative Products').

As well as presenting general information about this research project and its findings, the website hosts a major virtual exhibition called 'Alice to Alice: Dalziel 1865-1871'. This was curated by myself (Bethan Stevens), and it features around 200 highlights out of the 12,885 illustrations produced by the Brothers Dalziel in the years book-ended by their most famous publications, 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' (1865) and 'Through the Looking-Glass' (1871). The show is divided into ten thematic sections, and each one includes wood engravings from the Alice books, accompanied by other images created to illustrate work by Dickens, Christina Rossetti, Anthony Trollope and Hans Christian Andersen. It includes more unusual items that have never been exhibited since their first publication. For example, there are Victorian design and engineering illustrations, ranging from door knobs to the electric telegram and ballcock diagrams; medical and veterinary art; and wood-engraved interpretations of radical photography by Julia Margaret Cameron. The website content is written, curated and edited by Bethan Stevens (myself), with curatorial assistance from George Mind, who also developed the web design and built the site.
Since its launch last September, the website has been visited on 3164 separate occasions, by a total of 1967 visitors, from 55 countries around the world. 
The aim of the new website is to celebrate and share my research findings and resources in an innovative way, and encourage to artists, educators, researchers and other interested individuals to engage with it. For example, the website includes a blog in which we have published several new works inspired by the project's research and the database we have created of the Dalziel Archive: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel/category/createandcomment/ . This blog includes critical and creative work; it has published new poetry, word-image works, visual art and short accessible essays. It includes works by academics, 16-17 year old art students, and emerging new creative writers. All the works were directly inspired by this project.

The workshop offered an afternoon of talks and creative writing practice around the collections of the British Museum's department of Prints and Drawings. I introduced the current project, talking about my research on the archive and about the discoveries made about wood engraving. We particularly focused on wood engravings of the sea and of Arctic landscapes, and Nancy Campbell, whose poetry collection is themed around the Arctic, led a discussion of these. Participants wrote poetry inspired by the Dalziel wood engravings.
There were eleven particpants at the workshop with varying occupations: writing, curating, bookselling, librarianship, arts organisation and architecture. Two participants reported that work done in the workshop would be developed in forthcoming publications: a professional novelist said the workshop helped her develop her new novel about wood engravers, and a lecturer from Kent said she would use poetry written in the workshop to help complete the coda to her forthcoming poetry collection. Two postgraduate students from other institutions (Kings and Goldsmiths) said our workshop helped them develop ideas and a poem for their PhD and MA work respectively. Other participants arrived with less experience of writing, and said the work introduced them to new ideas about creative writing, wood engraving and word-image relationships, as well as teaching them new writing techniques. Two of the participants were involved in teaching creative workshops outside of a university setting (at the British Council and the British Museum) and both said they would use ideas from the workshop in their future teaching, being inspired by some of our collaborative exercises and by the use of archives for creative work.
Some poems written during our workshop are published on the Dalziel blog ('Ice Bound', 'A Glass of this Kind' and 'Song for Gouging Wood and Water'), with more to come.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c98bebaf5996.79160143</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel/category/createandcomment/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cataloguers' Tea (British Museum)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FD693277-188B-4C07-B347-DB67AD2C7273</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On July 15th 2016 I contributed to a 'Cataloguers' Tea' at the British Museum Prints and Drawings department.

During that month alone, our tweets had a total of 33,899 impressions, and were actively engaged with 1084 times. This included 151 retweets, 250 likes and 11 replies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c98741a1e2d4.97416895</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/dalzielproject</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BAVS annual conference, Cardiff</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>730396CF-D454-4A4B-9EF4-6E8D7A0232AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My talk was entitled 'Greedy Rats: The Business of Victorian Wood Engraving'.

The project was called 'Engraved in Time: Reimagining the Dalziel Brothers', and it was developed out of research material from the current award. Working with tutors at UCA, George Mind devised a study unit based on Bethan Stevens's research about the Dalziel family and about the history of wood engraving, especially in relation to themes and theories about time in the visual arts. 

As well as producing the study pack and devising the unit with the tutors, we made two visits to Rochester to work with the 58 students who were involved: George Mind visited at the start of the project, to introduce it, and Bethan Stevens and George Mind visited together at the end of the project, to help the tutors assess the students' work, and to talk with students about how they'd used the research. The art work students produced accounted for 15% of their final diploma mark. 

We have since published some of the students' work on our website ('Knight and Beggar' and 'Who Cares for You? You're Nothing but a Pack of Cards', with more forthcoming - url below). News about the project and their outcomes has been spreading e.g. through Twitter (@dalzielproject). Some of the students' work is really brilliant, and through these avenues we can help them reach new audiences themselves.

We see this as a pilot and will seek to do more work with school-age art students in the future. 

Tutors commented that they were 'extremely pleased' with student work for this unit, and that it was 'infinitely better' in comparison with previous years, especially since 'in the past students have struggled to engage with and pass this unit'. Both tutors described the education pack as 'excellent', and noted that our website had 'heaps of useful knowledge'. One of the tutors noted that 'the students enjoyed the research aspect which has sometimes been lacking in other projects' and that they 'really engaged with the Dalziel Project as it was a &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; project', and that students were inspired by the possiblity of publication on our blog, as well as the links to the University of Sussex and the British Museum. One tutor commented that they themselves learned about the contexts of the Dalziel illustrations, and felt that our 'rich resources' fostered enthusiasm. Both tutors said they would want to run this project again.

Of the 36 students who completed our feedback forms, 32 said they found the Dalziel Project inspiring. 27 said that the project helped develop their research skills. 25 reflected on things that they had learned about the Dalziel family, wood engraving, printmaking and Victorian art. 22 said they planned to develop the work done for this project in future assignments. Several noted that they were artistically inspired by the fine 'detail' and 'intricacy' of Dalziel's work, and their comments suggest the benefits of our medium-focused approach. Selected comments from student feedback forms are listed below:

Student comments on artistic medium:
'It made me see art in a different way. Rather it opened my eyes to a different style of artwork.'
'I found the images were so detailed and neat from very small lines which was one of the reasons why I decided to use biro.'
'The details were so fine and delicate making the engravings look like a piece of fine art'.
'All the images were done through engravings and the artists could get so much detail into them.'
'I've learnt that there are more ways of doing art rather than sticking in a photo that I took on an iPhone.'
'We could learn how to do wood cuts at college, that would be fun'

Comments on the Dalziel's work:
'I thought that the history of the Dalziel images and the way the Dalziel family worked as a company was very interesting and inspiring.'
'The method [of wood engraving] was very strenuous.'
'I learnt that the Dalziels existed and that printmaking was a huge part of communication and mass production in the Victorian Era. I also learnt how wood prints were made.'
'I found it inspiring getting to work with a moment in history and recreating in my way the story of the whole family's business, and how many famous books they illustrated was just amazing.'
'It's a brilliant project.'

Comments on research:
'I'd love to develop these ideas in my final project, especially the illustrative side to it. I really enjoyed researching the history behind this art'.
'I have always struggled with research but this project helped me to produce information in relation to what I was doing at a high standard.'
'I think this project helped me look beyond the obvious and the norm. It also taught me how to do lots and lots of research to help my ideas'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c946a4c16266.68932907</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel/category/createandcomment/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition Launch - Brighton Digital Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4587036A-DB0E-42E7-AC24-453C0E5083AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 21st September 2016 we had a launch event for our virtual exhibition, 'Alice to Alice: Dalziel 1865-1871'.

Using a range a media, we made a stunning site-based display out of the virtual exhibition. We opened this to the public as part of the Brighton Digital Festival; some of the visitors we spoke to included local designers and photographers. A few days beforehand I led a creative writing workshop at Sussex using the exhibition, and on the day we put on a series of talks with contributions from Hannah Field, George Mind, Nicholas Royle, Lindsay Smith and myself (all Sussex) and Isabel Seligman (British Museum). There were just over a hundred visitors on the one day we were open. Following the success of this event, we are planning a follow-on funding bid for an impact activity working with schools across Britain to co-curate and install digital exhibitions of Victorian illustration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c981a0821160.09967837</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/event/virtual-exhibition-alice-alice-dalziel-1865-1871/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4819</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Sussex</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>(with new co-investigators: Hannah Field and Lindsay Smith)</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>F10541C2-498C-41BC-8DB8-2B32DEA21D03</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9450eb8bdc9.14443782</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>a. I have been sharing findings with colleagues at the British Museum, so that my work on the archive is substantially shaping the use and preservation of the collection in the future. This sharing takes place as part of my daily work, but also in more formal presentations such as my contribution to the 'Cataloguers' Tea' in July 2016.
b. A successful creative writing workshop, 'Seascapes and the Arctic', was held at the British Museum in December 2016. We used my research to inspire new works by established and emerging writers, and some pieces are already published on our website (http://www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel/category/createandcomment/ ).
c. A successful collaborative educational project with UCA Rochester has meant that my research findings have helped shape the artwork produced by fifty-eight 16 to 17-year-old students on the Extended Diploma in Art and Design. An educational pack was developed by the Research Technician, George Mind, to share my research with the students. The new unit that we developed will be used again by UCA Rochester in future years. This is an outcome unanticipated in my original proposal, and I hope to colloborate on more educational impact work in the future.

1. The writing and completion of an article for the journal Textual Practice. The article is titled 'Wood engraving as ghostwriting: the Dalziel Brothers, losing one's name, and other hazards of the trade'. It has already been peer reviewed and accepted for publication, and I expect publication soon. The article was not planned at the proposal stage, and in this I exceed my objectives.
2. The completion of a substantial amount of primary research and writing towards my monograph on the Dalziel Brothers, 'The Wood Engravers' Self Portrait'. I have written 50,000 words for this since my last report, making the current total approximately 80,000. I am thus on target to meet my goal of substantially completing the monograph by the end of the grant period. This has assisted with the crucial objective of answering my research questions. My manuscript outlines several new discoveries about the Victorian techniques for making wood engravings, and the collaborative labour structures that were involved, uncovering new information about Dalziel family members and employees (including little known women engravers, for example). I also develop new word-image theories, particularly around the figures of the hand, the line and the signature.
3. The completion and publication of my online catalogue of the Dalziel Archive as part of the British Museum Collection Online database. My catalogue makes this phenomenal resource accessible to scholars for the first time. I have also supervised the uploading of the 14,000 professional photographs taken for the project onto Collections Online, attached to my catalogue entries. The uploading process brought unexpected technical challenges which have now been resolved. In this work we exceeded the project objectives, since since the photographs we have produced of the entire archive are of a commercial quality; this was not anticipated at the proposal stage.
4. My objective to interpret and make accessible the Dalziel Archive has also been met. Accessibility has been achieved by the publication of the database entries mentioned in point one above. My research for this database has made legible and accessible a phenomenal archive that was previously unknown and extremely difficult to navigate.
5. In addition, in collaboration with research technician George Mind I have created a new website for the project that far exceeds my initial proposal to set up a project blog. The url is www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel . The website presents my research accessibly in the form of a substantial virtual exhibition about the Dalziel Brothers, 'Alice to Alice: Dalziel 1865 - 1871'. More information about this website is given in several engagement activity outputs in my portfolio. As mentioned, since its launch last September, the website has been visited on 3164 separate occasions, by a total of 1967 visitors, from 55 countries around the world. We also put on a site-specific launch at the University of Sussex digital humanities lab, as part of the Brighton Digital Festival. The work we have done on the website has been supported by a successful Twitter campaign, with 33,899 impressions in December alone. 
6. My objective to develop skills as a research leader has been met through several engagement activities. More information about these is given in several portfolio outputs, and in the section on 'narrative impact'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am actively engaged with scholars interested in Victorian illustration, involved in regular discussion and debate through research papers, networks, and conferences. 
In June 2017 my project will host an academic conference at the British Museum, 'Woodpeckings: Victorian prints, book illustration and word-image narratives'. Several speakers attending the conference are using the research that I have published in my online catalogue to inform their talks, so that this project is already provoking multiple scholarly responses to the Dalziel Archive. The conference brings together academics, curators and visual artists to create a fresh new perspective on Victorian mass-produced art. Accessible scholarly essays inspired by this project are published on our website (http://www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel/category/createandcomment/ ). 
The creative workshops and educational projects mentioned in my portfolio ('Engagement Activities') have already involved many others beyond academia in using my findings. New writing has been produced by workshop participators, as well as new works of visual art. Some of these are gradually being published on our website (http://www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel/category/createandcomment/ ). Several participants in these projects commented that they plan to develop their creative work further, and tutors who took part in the workshops and the educational project also commented that they plan to use Dalziel project findings or strategies in their future teaching. 
Further educational and creative work using my research findings is planned for the year ahead. In April 2017 I am hosting a workshop for contemporary wood engravers at the British Museum. In July 2017 I am hosting a teachers' workshop in the museum, this time for teachers of level 3 students (11 to 14 year olds). The teachers' workshop will develop educational activities out of my research and also research by colleagues Luisa Cal&amp;eacute; (Birkbeck), Lindsay Smith (Sussex) and Hannah Field (Sussex). We hope this will lead to further research collaborations in the future which again will encourage the findings of this project to be further put to use by others.
I have been pursusing opportunities for engagement that are likely to assist in my goals for inspring others with my research. An accessible narrative of my research was published in the online Guardian (26th November 2016), 'Alice in Wonderland's engravings - a forgotten story in pictures' (5942 shares on Facebook). In May 2016 I was invited to give a BAVS Talk, as part of an accessible series that represents leading research on Victorian Studies. This was professionally filmed and uploaded to YouTube (184 views). In spring 2018 I am curating a gallery display based on my research in the British Museum, which will bring the research to further audiences again.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>867539FF-1838-4611-95A8-1FA529CF016A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df5fa7afcea8.55411322</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>N.B.: from the 2016 report.

My contribution to the British Museum Collections Online database comprises one extended catalogue entry for each of the 49 albums that make up the Dalziel Archive, a collection of 54,000 wood engravings. Entries summarise the historical and material knowledge of the albums discovered in my primary research. My research identifies many previously unknown illustrations with specific writers, publishers and books. I have identified designers of specific wood engravings where possible, attributing designers to thousands of illustrations. Entries vary, but each of my 49 records is approx 1000 words long, not including the attribution of designers to thousands of specified prints. 
I have also managed the process of photographing the Archive page by page, working on this with Sylph Editions, and producing approximately 16,000 images of 54,000 prints. These are discussed in more detail in the sections on 'Intellectual Property and Licensing' and 'Artistic and Creative Products'.
42 of my catalogue entries have now been published. The remaining seven will be completed shortly.
