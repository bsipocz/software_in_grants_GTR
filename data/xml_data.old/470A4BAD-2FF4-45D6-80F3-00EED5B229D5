A study of inequities in health and long-term care among the elderly in rural China</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N002717/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposed study seeks to address key questions concerning the health and LTC among rural elderly in China, bridging the research gap in this area, and offering policy suggestions. People above the age of 60 account for more than 15% of the Chinese rural population. This percentage is expected to increase in the next few decades. In rural China, elderly people are relying on family members to provide care. However, as more and more young people are migrating to big cities, the expectation that family members will be available to provide care for rural elderly is becoming unrealistic. Institutional LTC care is usually expensive in China, and although the government partially reimburses the costs through a social health insurance scheme or other mechanisms, service users are still responsible for a substantial amount of co-payments. These costs may be too expensive for the rural elderly living in poverty to afford, which exacerbates the issue of unequal access to care. 

The proposed study seeks to examine inequities in health and LTC among rural elderly in China. This study will first examine whether the socioeconomic status of the rural elderly is associated with their health status. It will then assess the impact of a non-communicable disease prevention and control programme on rural elderly with different socioeconomic backgrounds, and also examine whether the needs of the rural elderly population can be sufficiently addressed with home-based care support. The study will simulate the population structure of the rural Chinese in the next few decades, and predict whether the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) (the only financial support available to the rural elderly to finance their LTC) will be sustainable in the long term. It will draw lessons on LTC financing from other developed countries, and propose potential policy recommendations for decision makers. 

The study results will benefit a number of stakeholders including policy makers who are designing ageing-related policies in China, organisations specialising in home-based LTC services, the rural elderly and their family carers. The study results will reveal how the current health status and patterns of health care and LTC use among the rural elderly differ across different socioeconomic groups. The intention is to inform the policy making process and encourage policy makers to re-examine existing health and LTC policies. Organisations specialising in home-based LTC will also benefit from this study, because this study aims to identify whether the current family care is able to meet the needs of the elderly and identify areas where there may be opportunities to develop formal home-based LTC care. Finally, this study will benefit rural elderly and their family members by engaging them in various dissemination activities and dialogues with policy makers and other relevant parties. 

This study will employ sophisticated econometrics methods, such as the Concentration Index, Instrumental Variables (IV), and various other simulation models. Data will be drawn from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). This study builds on initial quantitative skills in health inequity research I have developed from my previous work (e.g. the Concentration Index and Panel Data Regressions), and is complemented by training opportunities that the Future Research Leaders Scheme provides (e.g. advanced quantitative courses and various knowledge exchange workshops). The scheme will put me in a position to deliver strong evidence-based policy research that can influence policies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed study is designed to address key questions concerning the health and LTC among the rural elderly in China, bridging the research gap in this area and offering policy suggestions. This proposed study will benefit a wide range of audience members. Potential beneficiaries and stakeholders are listed as follows:
1. Policy makers
National level: National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC; formerly the Ministry of Health) of the People's Republic of China, Ministry of Civil Affairs (MoCA)
Provincial level: Provincial MoCA and Committee of Ageing (CoA), Zhejiang Province
This proposed study aims to reveal issues relating to inequities in health and LTC systems among the rural Chinese elderly, provide evidence of current and future need and demands of health and LTC services among rural elderly in China, as well as offer policy recommendations. At a national level, the study results may be used to raise awareness and inform policy makers in the NHFPC about health and LTC policies in rural China. In particular, RQ4 seeks to use a probabilistic population projection model and possibly other related simulation methods to conduct population level projections, and this will inform policy makers on the sustainability of the current Chinese health and LTC system, and offer recommendations regarding LTC policies for the rural elderly. Policy makers will be invited to become members of the advisory group, participate in the project workshop and conference, as well as comment on the research papers and the plain language report. 

2. NGOs and other related social care organisations
RQ3 in this proposed study focuses on family care and other types of home-based LTC in rural areas. The findings may be useful for related adult social care service providers or organisations as evidence for developing activities relating to home-based elderly care in rural China. 

The proposed research plans to make contact with home-based LTC providers through the researchers at Zhejiang University. Using the CHARLS survey Zhejiang sub-survey, the proposed research will present results on the level of unmet needs for the rural elderly who receive home-based care and identify relevant areas that social care providers or organisations should focus on. Representatives from social care providers will also be invited to attend workshops and exchange opinions and knowledge with government officials, academic researchers and service users, in order to inform their practice.

3. Rural elderly, family members of rural elderly in China
Issues relating to inequities in health status and the utilisation of health and LTC among the rural elderly should be examined and should be recognised. It is important to note that the burden of family care of the rural elderly should not only be shared with the elderly and their families, but also with the wider society. The proposed study calls for attention to be paid by the government, to take responsibility for provision of publicly-subsidised social care for the rural elderly. This will also reduce the burden for the rural family. The proposed research plans to invite rural elderly and their family members to project workshops and other relevant events. These events will provide the rural elderly with opportunities to express their opinions, and engage in the policy dialogue with the decision makers and academics. They will also be invited to comment on the draft of the plain language report, which will be disseminated to relevant parties. 

4. Academics
Limited research has been carried out in the field of LTC in rural China. This research will raise the awareness of health and LTC research among Chinese and international scholars, bridge the research gap, provide new findings and call for more engagement in the field of health and LTC research in China.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>269147</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hong Kong University of Science and Tech</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborations with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Long-term Care Financing among the Elderly in China</gtr:description><gtr:id>B2268B04-F7A4-4BAC-AB71-F14F0A1F901B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper accepted with minor correction

Two project papers focuses on financing LTC in China. One of the papers assessed the performance of one financing model - LTC insurance. As the central government has decided to further expand the LTC insurance to fifteen cities in the affluent Eastern provinces as well as the less developed South Western and North Western provinces, this paper therefore empirically assesses the performance of LTC insurance in Qingdao with an aim to provide policy recommendations based on an improved understanding of the scheme. The findings in Qingdao are likely to inform the LTC financing policy in other metropolitan areas in the country. 

Furthermore, the findings generated from the third paper on urban/rural disparities in LTC needs and access urges the policy makers to take actions to address issues relating to unmet needs and serious shortage of home- and community-based LTC services, particularly in rural areas, and improve equitable access to LTC services. This is potentially important as LTC system has always been neglected in the rural governments' policy agenda.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A574868B-34EB-4706-AE22-4B82F3FE72A5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c2ce265f33f0.21859141</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through the first year of the grant, I have a number of key findings. 
? The first finding relates to the current financing models for long-term care (LTC) in China. As the Chinese government is piloting new ways to finance its LTC sector, I have conducted a focused review of academic and grey literature, supplemented with qualitative interviews with government officials from relevant departments, care home staff and service users to assess different financing models that currently been used in China. Three emerging models are explored: Social Health Insurance (SHI) in Shanghai, LTC Nursing Insurance (LTCNI) in Qingdao, and a means-tested model in Nanjing. I find that, although SHI appears to be a convenient solution to fund LTC, this model has led to systematic bias in affordable access among participants of different insurance schemes, and has created a powerful incentive for the over-provision of unnecessary services. The means-tested method has been remarkably constrained by narrow eligibility and insufficiency of funding resources. The LTCNI model is by far the most desirable policy option among the three studied here, but the narrow definition of eligibility has substantively excluded a large proportion of elders in need from access to care, which needs to be addressed in future reforms. 
? Secondly, using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey 2011, I investigated on inequity in LTC needs and access among the elderly in rural and urban China. I find that the rural elderly has significantly higher LTC needs and unmet needs compared with the urban elderly, and the rural poor are more likely to report poor health outcomes compared with the rural rich. The urban elderly, especially the urban rich, have started to use other types of LTC in addition to informal care, whereas LTC support in rural areas is still largely limited to informal care provided by family members. 
? Lastly, I empirically assesses the performance of a pilot LTC financing programme-the Long-term Care Nursing Insurance (LTCNI) in Qingdao using data from a fieldwork trip conducted in Qingdao in 2016. I find that there are significant disparities in terms of reimbursement rates across participants with different SHI status. The results also suggest that the care providers are incentivised to provide care at the least cost even this care is deemed as insufficient or inadequate. There is also viability issues concerning the scheme because this scheme primarily withdraw its funds from the SHI system.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As suggested by the funding proposal, I have used a number of ways to disseminate the findings. First, I have set up a website based on the finding of the project. The website contains various information about the study summary, key outputs of the project, publications, etc. The website acts as a main platform to disseminate study results. As the language of the website is English, the next step is to include a Chinese version of the website. Second, an advisory group has been formed, and this group includes academics from the Chinese Academy of Social Science, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Fudan University, as well as non-academic advisors from care homes in China. The advisory group will help to disseminate the study results to the relevant parties in the government bodies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AE526EB0-0D7C-4EE2-8EC4-C675DFB1AAB3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2cdf7dfce23.93834922</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://drweiyang.weebly.com/inequities-in-long-term-care-in-china.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Commissioned by National Institute on Aging (U.S.), the World Bank and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the CHARLS is an ongoing, publicly available, international collaborative project that collected a nationally representative sample of Chinese residents ages 45 and above. A total of 28 provinces/autonomous regions varying substantially in terms of geography, economic development, public resources and health indicators were included in the survey. The survey employed multi-stage sampling. First stratified by urban and rural community and then by GDP per capita, a population weighted sampling scheme was used to randomly select 150 counties. Three urban and rural communities (Primary Sampling Unit) were then selected within each county-level unit using Probabilities Proportional to Size sampling method. Households with persons aged 45 and above were surveyed, and the one who was aged 45 or above and his/her spouse were interviewed. 

The CHARLS is designed to investigate issues relating to health, economic position and quality of life as people age. It includes questions on socioeconomic status, i.e., gender, age, education, marital status, occupation, wealth, region, and ethnicity. It also has questions on health outcomes and health services utilisation, insurance coverage and health providers, and long-term care needs and use.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C1368F0-C281-4F74-81CB-C65BCB008540</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This data can be used in other studies relating to health and LTC in China.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2d47ded2195.82990282</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data handling &amp; control</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B43FE5E5-7C32-4C91-885B-BB9EAA6DA225</gtr:id><gtr:title>Financing institutional long-term care for the elderly in China: a policy evaluation of new models.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health policy and planning</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/171c6e26919f4e77ff81da804124e081"><gtr:id>171c6e26919f4e77ff81da804124e081</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yang W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0268-1080</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>57978591c1b8d9.82093731</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N002717/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>470A4BAD-2FF4-45D6-80F3-00EED5B229D5</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/N002717/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>269147.82</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-01-11</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-08-16</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>6C2036A8-CFCC-44E3-BB19-D85EAE327A8E</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/N002717/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>227206.4</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-08-17</gtr:start><gtr:end>2019-05-17</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6A8697C-69DA-4020-8D45-9901CA002827</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Global Health and Medicine</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E398036B-8D9A-43E0-BBBA-AF0932365C69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
