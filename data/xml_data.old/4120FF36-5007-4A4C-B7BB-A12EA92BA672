(2007). The FPD model system will be used in two experiments to determine the relationship between different foot pad lesion scores and pain. In addition we will more clearly define the minimum litter moisture content that will avoid the risk of FPD. We will evaluate the minimum score associated with evidence of pain in an experiment that replicates commercial practices to evaluate the degree of pain or discomfort associated with different FPD scores at different ages in commercial flocks. In conjunction with WP1 of the ANIHWA project we will propose thresholds so that the recommended commercial scoring scheme supports the welfare of turkeys. We will also assess techniques for assessing litter moisture as both a management aid and as a welfare indicator.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Experiment 1
Turkey poults from two genotypes with contrasting susceptibility to foot pad dermatitis (FPD) will be reared on wood shavings to 28 days of age. Thereafter the litter conditions will be modified by the addition of quantities of water (maximum 50% litter moisture) and FPD scored at 35 days to titrate litter moisture and susceptibility (randomised block of 2 strains x 4 treatments x 6 reps (48 pens) of 4 poults).

Experiment 2
Commercial poults will be reared on two types of wood based litter (shavings vs chips) and fed on three isonutritional diets based on soya and alternative protein sources. FPD will be scored at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of age (Mayne et al., 2007) and production traits recorded (randomised block, 2 litters x 3 diets x 6 replicates of 10 poults). 

Subsidiary experiment 1.
We will evaluate electronic soil moisture instruments for assessing litter moisture content and determine their utility for monitoring and managing litter conditions during the course of the research. Litter moisture will be assessed using alternative soil moisture instruments and validated against moisture determined by drying in an oven to more clearly defined the minimum litter moisture to minimise the occurrence of FPD.

Subsidiary experiment 2.
Evidence for pain associated with different FPD scores will be determined by providing analgesics to turkeys using previously validated analgesic treatments(bupivacaine injected into the foot pad and betamethasone injections over 3 days) in the experimental model for inducing FPD (Mayne et al., 2007) at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of age. Evidence for pain will be assessed using a novel walkway system Tracksys), behaviour in the home pens (Observer analysed focal observations and THEME analysis of behaviour sequences) and accelerometers attached to the back of the birds. The relationship between different foot pad lesion scores and pain will be determined to establish the minimum score associated with evidence of pain.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries of the research will be the commercial partners on the project including many that provide materials and/or that commit their flocks for use in the project. These groups will be able to implement changes to husbandry and management to improve the welfare of turkeys and potentially to avoid penalties for high levels of foot pad dermatitis in birds at the abattoir.

The benefits of the research will be extended to the wider industry after completion of the project. As in the past, research with turkeys has also informed research with broiler chickens. In this was the wider national and international scientific community will also benefit. 

Foot pad dermatitis has become important as a welfare issue in commercial poultry and is the focus of legislation. The research will impact on legislation in Europe and the results will be useful for scientific panels (e.g. EFSA Animal Health and Welfare) reviewing evidence in support of legislation on turkey and poultry welfare.

The research will contribute to the competitiveness of the European turkey industry, initially in the participating countries and subsequently in the rest of Europe. It will increase the welfare of turkeys and contribute to an improved image of the turkey industry and so enhance the quality of life for consumers that are concerned about animal welfare. 

The results of the research will have an immediate effect on commercial flocks as the research is conducted in collaboration with industry. The timescale to implementation is likely to be very short as recommendations can be adopted in terms of months rather than years and will be started before the completion of the project.

A large component of the project (conducted in Italy) is the training of assessors for on-farm and abattoir workers to determine foot pad condition in turkeys. The processes and training materials will be used in subsequent extension work. The scientific methods applied in experimental research are novel and may be used in comparable research into gait and other musculoskeletal disorders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75280</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Research was used to inform farmers of methods for reducing foot pad dermatitis.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>26DE1F08-4908-46B5-B87B-355D2D84433F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d994d6d04545.91082514</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>New grant, too soon to have outcomes</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>New grant - too soon to record findings</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>45700E34-F181-4100-9715-94182041F4EC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460c79ea8c1f5.42212619</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A Web based application was developed that uses a library of foot pads of turkeys with contact dermatitis as a tool for training new scoring assessors. The tool is available over the web for any user to improve precision and consistency (between and within assessors) and can be accessed through a laptop, tablet or mobile phone device. The interclass correlation for each use is provided at the end of the &amp;quot;trial&amp;quot; and each attempt takes about 10-15 minutes to complete. A summary of all the data is provided for the &amp;quot;owner&amp;quot; for assessing overall value and potentially for validation and training purposes. The web address is: www.footpad.roslin.ed.ac.uk.
Scoring systems are widely used in welfare research and the tool could in principle us modified for use in many alternative assessment systems.</gtr:description><gtr:id>261F853E-C759-4988-B9F0-539FC3933639</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tool was used for training of both commerical assssors and particpants in the research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8612fb58767.47369122</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Welfare coding training tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.footpad.roslin.ed.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6549EA74-23B4-4CC8-BEEF-0255E1778F0D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effect of crude protein concentration and dietary electrolyte balance on litter quality, foot pad dermatitis, growth performance and processing yields in two medium heavy turkey hybrids.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British poultry science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c0afd0d37420534fb44814a17288f46c"><gtr:id>c0afd0d37420534fb44814a17288f46c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Veldkamp T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0007-1668</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7328ed86c990.92799781</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A96C52B4-0233-4E40-9327-091A0BD3FB8C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Soya bean meal increases litter moisture and foot pad dermatitis in maize and wheat based diets for turkeys but maize and non-soya diets lower body weight.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British poultry science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0ac0c3283f7fc08ad8b443d4b3ae0939"><gtr:id>0ac0c3283f7fc08ad8b443d4b3ae0939</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hocking PM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0007-1668</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a73288ec2a519.35919652</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>87D8E172-F6F9-4E09-9B71-095B9584428E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Behavioural assessment of pain in commercial turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) with foot pad dermatitis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British poultry science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9b8e937115ca36efe414c34a2b80c707"><gtr:id>9b8e937115ca36efe414c34a2b80c707</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sinclair A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0007-1668</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b41b99892168.80819700</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AD05E0BF-810C-42B0-8450-FE1FE8386DF9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Footpad dermatitis and pain assessment in turkey poults using analgesia and objective gait analysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British poultry science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/33e37bcd9cae6c49dce8c19a31073cf9"><gtr:id>33e37bcd9cae6c49dce8c19a31073cf9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Weber Wyneken C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0007-1668</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b41b9958f528.41797753</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L012022/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D5C57767-F44D-42BE-B074-C153A3C8EEA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Welfare</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
