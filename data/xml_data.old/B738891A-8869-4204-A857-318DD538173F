BPA qualifies for orphan drug designation (ODD) for which we intend to apply.

The proposed project is to carry out a first in man (FIM) study, with adaptive design to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple oral doses of KCL-286. Target engagement will also be assessed as a surrogate measurement of KCL-286 activity. We have identified a putative pharmacodynamic (PD) marker: plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) which is known to be directly regulated by RARb activation. A regeneration marker has also been identified, S100B in plasma, that in preliminary studies, directly correlates with KCL-286 induced axonal regeneration measured at the end of treament in our animal model.

There are currently more than 2.5 million individuals worldwide who are living with paralysis as the result of a spinal cord injury (SCI), making it a far more common ailment than many people realise. The majority of people who endure a life-changing spinal injury are young, and the effect on those afflicted can be devastating, affecting their personal prospects in a myriad of ways, from the obvious physical impairment to battles with mental health. The impact of such a condition can be far reaching, influencing the injured person's personal life and professional prospects, as well as the wider impact on family and friends.
We have developed a novel orally available RARb agonist (KCL-286) that induces axonal regeneration with functional recovery in a rodent model of spinal cord injury. This project's primary objective is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of KCL-286 in heathy volunteers to enable the progression to Phase 2a study to test the human efficacy. The main deliverable will be the data on which to achieve the optimal design for the Phase 2a study and this will provide the most efficient path to proof of principal which is intended to be a small group of patients who suffered brachial plexus avulsion (BPA). A successful outcome will represent a significant breakthrough in the treatment of BPA in the shorter term and in a longer term, of other CNS injuries for which recovery is dependent on axonal regeneration and that are of high priority for global healthcare provision (other SCIs, traumatic brain injuries and stroke). 
Therefore, another major impact goal of this project is the commercial exploitability of KCL-286 since its wide potential therapeutic value will be very attractive to pharmaceutical and commercial industries with specific interest in developing new drugs for the treatment of CNS regeneration. 
This will have a substantial impact on clinical medicine and disease management, which will ultimately improve the economic competitiveness of healthcare in the UK as well as human health and quality of life on a global scale.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1795160</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R006466/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
