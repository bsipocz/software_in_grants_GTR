Both critics and defenders of clerical marriage attempted to claim support from the example of the early church; debate was vigorous and its outcome contested.\nThe era of the Reformation saw this debate reach a much broader audience; for many of the laity the marriage of their priest would have been one of the most visible aspects of the Protestant reformation, giving the issue prominence at all levels of the church.The printing press facilitated the rapid and immediate dissemination of evangelical literature, and helped to provide a link between the ideological controversies and the practical experience of clerical celibacy and marriage in the parishes.I will examine the evangelical challenge to the disciplines and traditions of the Catholic church, both in the open practice of clerical marriage in the reformed churches, and in the vigorous polemical debate that was spawned by the question of clerical celibacy, and perceptions of contemporary clerical morality.This will be accompanied by a discussion of the Catholic response to this challenge to ecclesiastical discipline, and an analysis of the influence of precedents from the history of the Greek and Latin churches on the debates of the Reformation period. Finally, I will offer some concluding comments on the legacy left to the western church by the upheavals of the period 1100-1700, and the intellectual, pastoral, political, and moral pressures that have shaped debates over celibacy throughout the history of the church.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20455</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>17A20F7E-DC80-41AD-BB87-FB6FAE049866</gtr:id><gtr:title>Clerical Celibacy in the West: c. 1100-1700</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/eb0173acaf9187913714043803b55945"><gtr:id>eb0173acaf9187913714043803b55945</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parish</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780754639497</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_84993423523bf30044</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AA7829D4-76B8-4524-A78F-EE51EBB04A5F</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;It Was Never Good World Sence Minister Must Have Wyves&amp;quot;: Clerical Celibacy, Clerical Marriage, and Anticlericalism in Reformation England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Religious History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3d5be4a5ad745f7e3e18b8bf7d2dc6a9"><gtr:id>3d5be4a5ad745f7e3e18b8bf7d2dc6a9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>PARISH H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d067067918f270</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F003102/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
