&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>including the expansion of higher education&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>economic recession&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the increased unaffordability of housing. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>We examine how young adult?s parental backgrounds and profiles of education and employment relate to their ambitions and success in achieving residential independence in the UK and how these relationships are modified by gender and ethnicity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will deliver policy and practitioner relevant research through the exploitation of the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS), the English Housing Survey (EHS) and statistics on first year students? term time residence from the Higher Education Statistics Authority (HESA).This approach provides a timely opportunity to re-conceptualise young people?s housing pathways after a period of considerable political, economic and social change.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Understanding trends in young adults? living arrangements is required for marital status and household projections. Furthermore, welfare policies differentially affect housing careers by gender and parenthood status and this project will explore the potential impact of recent welfare reforms such as the extension in the age range affected by the limit to housing benefit resulting from the shared accommodation rate for men and women.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will provide impact in a number of the ESRC's key areas for priority including &amp;quot;Influencing Behaviour and Informing Interventions&amp;quot;. The project investigates attitudes and aspirations among different population subgroups and examines the family background, individual and wider societal factors associated with wellbeing in the context of attaining residential independence and suitable housing.

As a result of our user engagement in the design of the proposed research project we are confident that the project outputs will have significant impact beyond academia. In preparing the proposal we have consulted with Government analysts and policy makers e.g. the Family Demography Unit at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Housing Policy Unit at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). We also consulted stakeholders who are concerned with increased social inequality and the difficulties faced by many young adults in accessing suitable employment and housing e.g. Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) and the Resolution Foundation (RF). We believe the project could help increase the effectiveness of public policy in the UK and will provide information which will be of economic benefit to the private sector, particularly the housing industry. 

We have identified the following groups as some of the beneficiaries:
a) Government analysts in ONS responsible for making marital status and fertility projections. As noted in their letter for support, new insights into young people's aspirations for the timing of leaving home and family formation will be useful inputs into projections of future trends in family formation.
b) Government analysts in the Department for Communities and Local Government responsible for making future housing projections. Household projections are made by applying household representative rates to each age- and marital status- specific group. It is important therefore to have robust data on the increased propensity of young adults to share accommodation, rather than say live alone, since this decline in household representative rates has a significant implication for the overall number of houses required.
c) The Housing Industry will benefit from up to date knowledge about patterns in young adults' living arrangements, their aspirations for home ownership and recent experience with mortgage applications. 
d) Government policy makers who are required to evaluate the impact of changes in housing benefit provision - specifically the increase in the age threshold from age 25 to age 35 in the amount of housing benefit awarded. Single, young adults in receipt of housing benefit only receive a level of housing benefit equivalent to the level required to rent a room in shared accommodation. The recent increase in the age group affected by this policy up to those aged 34 has been controversial and there is a distinct lack of empirical knowledge e.g. concerning the size and characteristics of the population likely to be affected by this change in policy. In particular, DWP are keen to find out how many single men are in fact non-resident fathers. For these men, the cap in housing benefit to the level for shared accommodation is likely to restrict their ability to have their children to stay overnight and hence effectively co-parent.
e) A number of stakeholder organisations including JRF, RF, and Crisis are engaged in debates concerning the increased difficulties faced, particularly by young single adults, in accessing suitable housing. These organisations are keen to incorporate high quality academic research such as being proposed here as evidence to support their policy proposals. In our discussions they have asked in particular for further information on groups who hitherto have not been the focus of research - including the housing careers of BME young adults, non-resident parents, and those young adults not on benefits but whose wages and career prospects preclude home ownership.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>145550</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Resolution Fundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Meetings with Advisory Stakeholder Resolution Foundation</gtr:description><gtr:id>B1CA2B99-E28D-42B3-BFBA-86414286326B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Vidhya Alakeson and Laura Gardiner have commented on draft papers, some of which have been published, eg CPC Working Paper 55 - Economic precariousness and living in the parental home in the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54648a537c1008.56294031-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Vidhya Alakeson and Laura Gardiner have provided feedback on the original proposal, development of research questions and preliminary findings.

We have also discussed the relevance of our findings with those responsible for making plans and policies for housing at a sub-national level including representatives from the GLA. In discussing our findings with the Resolution Foundation (RF), a think tank focused on low to middle income workers, they commented that our work has made them think about how economic precarity is particularly affecting young workers (as opposed to all adult workers), and that they need to consider how economic precarity may prevent young people making transitions to adulthood in other life domains. RF were also very interested in our findings relating to increasing self-employment and short-hours working among UK youth and suggested that more detailed questions teasing out what this actually means for young adults need to be included in large scale surveys such as Understanding Society. Berrington has brought this issue to the attention of the Understanding Society Scientific Advisory Committee. Project findings have also been used by the private sector to inform their understanding of demographic change and especially the living arrangements of young adults. Experian, have launched a new version of their demographic segmentation software which highlights different population sub-groups according to their household structure. A number of new classification types based around the increased co-residence of young adults with their children have been developed. Experian invited Berrington to give a talk which included details of the ESRC project findings at their launch event in April 2014, which was attended by around 200 marketing experts from UK companies. It seems likely that the project will continue to have impact. 69% of attendees completed a feedback form at the end of the dissemination event in December 2014. Nine out of ten of these respondents said they would use the information from the event in their own work/studies, with the same numbers planning to pass the information onto colleagues.
Since 2016 Berrington has acted as an academic advisor to the DWP Families and Children and Disadvantage strategy team. I have met with the team 3 times in London and provided oral and written comments on DWP strategy for disadvantaged families. Evidence i.e. findings from research from the Aspirations In Young Adulthood project have been used by DWP in setting their framework for action.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>03B0C350-B3FF-42CB-B358-977082B89964</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54649711bc0190.70993309</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. New Knowledge: This project has generated new, policy relevant insights in three interrelated strands of research:
a. The impact of recent societal change (including the rise in participation in Higher Education, economic recession, welfare changes, and changes in the housing market) on the housing transitions of young adults. In particular we focus on the changing nature of the transition to residential independence and how the impact of economic precariousness on leaving home differs by gender, class and ethnicity. Work from this strand has been widely presented, written up in a journal article (Roberts, 2013), book chapter (Berrington &amp;amp; Stone, 2014), two Centre for Population Change working papers (#38 and #55) and two CPC policy briefing papers (#22 and #23). Work using HESA data to establish whether HE students are nowadays more likely to remain living in the parental home is on-going.

b. Aspirations for leaving home, for family formation, and for home ownership are explored using data from Understanding Society and the English Housing Survey. A paper examining ethnic differences in aspirations and realities for leaving home was presented at the Population Association of America conference, http://paa2014.princeton.edu/papers/141260. Analysis of tenure satisfaction and aspirations for home ownership were undertaken by Sarah Bruce for her MSc Social Statistics dissertation (Sept. 2013), supervised by Berrington and the results incorporated into subsequent papers (analysis attributed to Bruce). 

c. Understanding teenagers' aspirations for higher levels of education: the intersection of gender, class and ethnicity. This work is based on the analysis of responses to the Youth Questionnaire from wave 1 Understanding Society. The work has been presented to a variety of academic and non-academic user audiences, written up as a journal article (Roberts et al., 2014) and submitted to British Educational Research Journal, and summarised in briefing paper #21.

2. Interdisciplinary Working and Capacity Building: We have achieved our second objective which related to the need to approach the analysis of youth transitions from an inter-disciplinary perspective and for capacity building of quantitative skills. The project was enhanced by the sharing of ideas and methods between the PI Berrington (Demographer &amp;amp; longitudinal analysis expert), Co-I Roberts (Sociologist working in area of youth transitions), Academic Advisors: Bhopal (expert on ethnic minority experiences of education) and Stone (life course analyst). As a result of the formal and informal training undertaken as part of the project the RA has gained experience in the management and analysis of complex longitudinal data, including the evaluation of attrition bias, use of event history analyses and application of weights. Roberts, primarily a qualitative researcher, has also gained experience with Understanding Society, has learnt how to incorporate weights and complex survey designs into statistical analyses, and has gained knowledge of how to apply multiple regression techniques.

3. Engagement with stakeholders: We have engaged non-academic stakeholders throughout the project: gaining advice when writing the grant application, developing research questions, interpreting results, and drafting briefing papers. Advisors included: the Demography group at the Office for National Statistics; the Household Projections team at the Department for Community and Local Government, and from the Greater London Authority, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Resolution Foundation. Three of our stakeholders took part in the panel discussion reflecting on the policy implications of the project findings at the project dissemination event on December 5th, 2014. In April 2014 Berrington was invited by the EU Commission DG Employment to discuss the project findings at a research seminar attended by policy makers and analysts, on the effects of the economic crisis on young people http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1049?Id=en?wsId=2077&amp;amp;moreDocuments=yes&amp;amp;tableName=news. Project results have also benefited the private sector, informing the development of Experian's Mosaic Classification. Berrington was invited to talk about project findings relating to young adults' changing living arrangements at the launch of the 2014-release of Mosaic in April 2014.
 
4. Dissemination and networking: Findings have been disseminated using a range of publications and engagement activities including. Many of these are listed with photographs and links to conference papers and overheads on the project website http://www.cpc.ac.uk/research_programme/aspirations_and_realities/index.php

g. Other Media - articles which draw on project findings published in the Times and Financial Times.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Impact is on-going, but already our findings are feeding into ONS and DCLG population and household projections. Understanding of why rates of household formation have declined dramatically over the past decade is useful in order to project future trends in family and household formation. In particular, public sector (e.g. DCLG and GLA) and private sector organisations (including house-builders) want to know whether recent decreases in headship rates among young adults are part of a longer term change in transitions to adulthood and owner occupation, or whether recent trends are a shorter-term reaction to economic uncertainty. We have also discussed our findings as they emerged to think tanks e.g. Resolution Foundation, and to academic and policy audiences. Our end of project dissemination event was a great success. See project page for slides http://www.cpc.ac.uk/events/?action=story&amp;amp;id=365. 
Nine out of ten of the event attendees said in the feedback questionnaire that they would use the information from the event in their own work/studies, with the same numbers planning to pass the information onto colleagues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CEFEF346-4912-43E3-871C-50B5929AFB83</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546495d93a3b57.48943511</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities
