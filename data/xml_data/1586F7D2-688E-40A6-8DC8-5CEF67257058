It will examine formal and informal routines and processes, paying particular attention to how corporate leaders view and analyse risk and uncertainty.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will employ a range of qualitative methodological tools. Fieldwork with a number of organisations will involve observing meetings and other informal interactions between directors and senior managers, as well as shadowing a number of them. This will be combined with interviews across a larger number of organisations. The aim is to gain insight into the 'inner' working of organisations, particularly relationships between directors and senior managers, and how these affect political bargaining and knowledge creation processes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research aims to explore how corporate decision makers deal with the future. This would extend understanding of foresight techniques such as scenario analysis. In addition, the study seeks to challenge the dominant theoretical view, which sees boards as 'principals' exercising control over executive 'agents', drawing on the resource-based view, which sees a board role as helping secure and maintain access to resources. In so doing, it aims to contribute to the development of a behavioural theoretical paradigm.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The study would aim to have a high level of practical impact for practitioners and provide actionable insights for a range of beneficiaries. It would be particularly relevant for those working in areas that require them to think about and plan for uncertain futures whilst exercising effective governance. In particular, it would benefit executive and non-executive directors and senior managers through increasing their understanding of how to engage in more effective strategic planning, and better understand, plan for and manage future risk and uncertainty. It would also have benefits for policymakers and regulators in governments and international organisations, as well as practitioners providing consultancy services to both of these groups, through providing insights into more effective formulation and implementation of policies and methods that would facilitate strategic planning and good governance.

Practitioners would benefit from the project in a number of ways. Executive and non-executive directors and senior managers in the organisations in which in-depth ethnographic research is undertaken would benefit through insight gained during a research process that would facilitate reflection on board and management processes and routines, and how these feed into strategic planning and decision making, and risk analysis and management. In addition, they would have access to publications and other output that would give them the opportunity to benefit from the practical implications of the conclusions reached. As well as academic publication, the project would generate output directed at corporate and public sector decision makers, such as articles and reports for think tanks and consultancies; presentations and advice at conferences and other events aimed at practitioners; and training in scenario analysis and other tools to aid thinking about uncertain futures.
 
Participants would be made aware of potential benefits when soliciting participation. Existing relationships with think tanks and consultancies, gained through a ten-year career as a country and industry analyst, would be maintained. These would be likely to provide opportunities to publish thought leadership articles and offer advisory services that would give actionable insights to practitioner clients. Opportunities would be actively sought, through these relationships and other channels, to present at conferences and other events aimed at practitioners and offer advisory services to policymakers and regulators at a national and international level.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75762</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K00235X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
