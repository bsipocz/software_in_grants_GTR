The advent onto land of limbed vertebrates (tetrapods) was an event that shaped the future evolution of the planet, including the appearance of humans. The process began about 360 million years ago, during the late Palaeozoic, in the early part of the Carboniferous Period. Within the 20 million years that followed, limbed vertebrates evolved from their essentially aquatic and fish-like Devonian predecessors into fully terrestrial forms, radiating into a wide range of body forms that occupied diverse habitats and ecological niches. We know this because we have an adequate fossil record of the earliest limbed vertebrates from the Late Devonian, contrasting with the terrestrial forms that lived significantly later in the Early Carboniferous, about 340 million years ago. It is also clear that a mass extinction event occurred at the end of the Devonian, following which life on land and in fresh water habitats had to be re-established. Unfortunately, the formative 20 million years from the end of Devonian times has remained almost unrepresented for fossil tetrapods and their arthropod contemporaries. Thus, we know little about how tetrapods evolved adaptations for life on land, the environments in which they did so, and the timing or sequence of these events. The evolutionary relationships among these early tetrapods and how they relate to modern forms are also unclear and controversial as a result of this lack of fossil information. The entire fossil hiatus has been called 'Romer's Gap' after the American palaeontologist who first recognized it. Now, for the first time anywhere in the world, several fossil localities representing this period have been discovered in south-eastern Scotland. They have already provided a wealth of new fossils of tetrapods, fish, invertebrates and plants, and our team is the first to have the opportunity to study this material and the environmental, depositional, and climatic context in which this momentous episode took place. We have a number of major aims. The existing fossil material will form a baseline for this study, but the project will augment this by further excavating the richest of the sites so far found and subjecting it to a detailed archaeological-style analysis. We will collect from other recently recognized sites and explore for further sites with relevant potential. The fossil material will be described and analysed using a range of modern techniques to answer many questions related to the evolution of the animals and plants. Not only that, using stratigraphical, sedimentological, palynological, geochemical and isotopic data, we will establish the conditions of deposition that preserved the fossils, the environments in which the organisms lived and died, and the precise times at which they did so. We will drill a borehole that will core through the entire geological formation in which these fossils have been found. Using this, we will integrate data from our fossil sites using the signals provided by the sedimentary record to build a detailed time line showing in which horizons the fossils were found, the age of each occurrence and their sequential relationship. We will compare and correlate our data with that from contemporaneous deposits in Nova Scotia, the only other locality with information sufficiently rich to be meaningful. Our data will allow us to infer changes to the environment and the evolutionary trajectories of the animals and plants during the deposition of this formation, covering the 20 million years following the end-Devonian mass extinction. Comparison with similar data for the Late Devonian will allow us to chart the changes around the time of the mass extinction, to infer its causes and consequences, and obtain a detailed record of exactly how changes to the environment correlated with changes to the fauna and flora.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The earliest Carboniferous (Tournaisian) interval (360-340 Ma) has long formed a 'bottleneck' in studies of the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems, and particularly the earliest evolution of terrestrial tetrapods, because of the almost complete lack of fossil evidence from this key time. We are now able to populate this hiatus in fossil data as a result of recent discoveries in Scotland, and to place these specimens in a palaeoecological and stratigraphic context.
Given the current paucity of data previously available for study of the faunas and floras from this time, and the profound changes to terrestrial ecosystems that took place then, we fully expect our results to be literally and metaphorically ground breaking. The material we will discover and describe will be of international significance, and enhance the reputation of the UK as a centre of excellence for Palaeozoic tetrapod fossils and their study. We anticipate publication in high profile journals including Science and Nature. Our palaeontological results will benefit interrelated disciplines from anatomists through molecular phylogeneticists to palaeoecologists. Biomechanics of locomotion, feeding, and breathing will gain from the new insight into the basal anatomical conditions at the onset of terrestriality. Studies of the evolutionary development of skeletal systems, and the timing of key innovations in tetrapod morphological adaptations will use our findings. Molecular phylogenies will benefit from new calibration points for the origins of the tetrapod and actinopterygian crown groups. The geological aspects of the proposal will benefit those modelling ancient climates in deep time, environmental and sedimentary systems, and their influence on and relationship to key evolutionary events. The refined stratigraphical, isotopic and palynological data that our studies provide will augment the, so far, relatively poorly known picture of this key period. Our comprehensive dataset from the earliest Carboniferous of Scotland will provide a future standard of comparison for contemporary deposits in other parts of the world. The industry-standard geophysical log data will be of interest to petrophysicists in academia and their industry partners, from including civil engineers, the construction industry and the hydrocarbon industries, who are studying the characterisation and prediction of physical properties in UK rock formations. As a team, we are particular well placed for high impact in the press and other media, with two members situated in nationally and internationally renowned museums, and with close links to others. Both institutions have professional in-house officers who deal with outreach on a continuing basis. Our experience talking to media representatives, the general public and other non-academics including people local to our sites, suggests that this project is of wide public interest and appeal.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>489618</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science outreach through social media</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC87CA10-3571-4DD6-B033-E0CD87C3227A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Science outreach through the use of social media, with the aims of 1) increasing publicity about the TW:eed Project; 2) raising the profile of scientific research funded by NERC; 3) engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of scientists.

The subject of our NERC award (early Carboniferous terrestrialisation) was emphasised. The event provided valuable geological context for the public lecture given by Professor Jenny Clack. The University of Leicester undergraduate &amp;amp; postgraduate students were volunteer leaders and gained experience in developing activities suitable for 16-18 age group and motivating and organising the sixth form students to present their finding on the day.

The exhibit showcases some of the fossils found by the TW:eed Project and explains how scientists reconstruct the tetrapod animals and the environment they lived in. The exhibit has had record numbers of visitors so far as well as press coverage by the BBC and The Guardian. 

University of Leicester team members (Prof. Davies, Dr. Bennett) contributed to the exhibit by providing scientific information as to the environments tetrapods were living in, based on the findings of this research project. We also participated in filming to provide footage about the scientific objectives, how the data was gathered and the process of interpretation.

There have been no previous studies of the sedimentology of tetrapod deposits from this time period.

For the first time, we have identified a new taphofacies (specific type of sedimentary rock that preserves tetrapod fossils) and report our findings in Bennett et al. 2016 (DOI: 10.1111/sed.12280). Sandy siltstones have been identified, through this NERC-funded research, as an important but under-reported phenomenon that host and preserve the richest fossil deposits of this study (within the Ballagan Formation).

Published studies into the ancient climate using palaeosols (Kearsey et al. 2016, doi. /10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.05.033) reveal a complex system of monsoonal rains and periodic intervals characterised drier conditions. For the first time we are able to reveal detailed information as to the environments where tetrapods were living, how the ecosystem was constructed, and what the climate regime and this research underpinned the environmental context published in 'Nature Evolution and Ecology' (doi:10.1038/s41559-016-0002). 

The environmental context has been explored further in a publication drawing together ichnofossils (traces of animal life and activity in sedimentary rocks), micro- and micro-fossils evidence to look at cryptic marine incusions across these ancient floodplains (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.12.018). Further papers exploring this context are in an advanced state of drafting and include an examination the wetland development with evaporites (MIllward, Davies et al. in prep) and looking wider scale at the tectonic framework that promoted this region as a key stie recodring the rise of the land-based tetrapods. papers looking at the developing food webs are also in advnaced states and preliniary findig have been presented at international conferences (Bennett et al. 2016, Palaeontological Association).

An additional key sedimentological finding is that this 360 million years ago this region hosted a long-lived mosaic of aquatic &amp;amp; terrestrial environments. The region was characterised by an alternation of non-marine subenvironments (river channels, vegetated &amp;amp; forested floodplains, freshwater lakes, saline lakes (closed &amp;amp; more open)) that were influenced by short-lived marine transgressions. As reported in our publication (doi:10.1038/s41559-016-0002 ), recent studies of skeleton development in some animals can be modified early in life in response to exposure to water-based or land-based conditions. If the early tetrapods had similar skeletal flexibility then the varied environments of the Ballagan Formation studied here may have contributed to the land-adaptation of tetrapods. This will be an important avenue for future research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research has important implications for scientists in the fields of:
