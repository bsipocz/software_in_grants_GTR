This problem affects around 1 in every 4 people in the UK. In most cases, an allergic reaction to grass pollen triggers a blocked/runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes and chest tightness/wheezing (asthma). In half of these people this may interfere with work or school performance, sleep and social activities. Tablets and sprays may help some but not all sufferers. For these people, one option is a vaccine to ?switch off? the allergy (called immunotherapy): high doses of allergen are given by injection under the skin or as a daily tablet or drops under the tongue. However, these vaccines are expensive and the need for large numbers of injections in a specialist clinic or daily tablets at home is associated with additional expense and/or inconvenience. This project will test a new strategy, which we believe to be cheaper, safe and relatively quick. Injection of much smaller amounts of grass pollen higher up in the skin (called the dermis) provokes an allergic reaction in this area, visible as a lump lasting a day or two. We have observed that when these injections are repeated every 2 weeks, a dramatic reduction is seen in the size of this lump, suggesting that the allergic reactions are being switched off. We are now asking if this process also switches off grass allergy in the nose and improves hay fever symptoms. To test this we will perform a clinical trial at Guy?s Hospital. Ninety hay fever sufferers will be divided into 2 groups to receive either 7 injections of small quantities of grass pollen into the dermis or placebo (dummy) injections in the spring of 2013. In the summer of 2013 study participants will record their symptoms daily and scores will later be compared in the 2 groups. We will also take a small sample of skin from the injection site and blood samples at the beginning and end of the study for experiments into how this new treatment works. All participants will be made aware of this when enrolling in the study, although any person will be free to subsequently their change their mind and decline providing specimens. We believe that these injections are safe: during numerous clinical trials of immunotherapy we have never seen a serious reaction to this dose of grass pollen, although to ensure safety we still plan to observe all participants after the first injection. The team assembled has vast experience of such trials and the linked scientific experiments and includes a member of the NIHR Research Design Service to provide expert help with analysis of the results. Finally, this is a major study that has the potential to identify a new treatment for one of the commonest diseases in the UK. In doing so it would define a new scientific and clinical principle that could also be applied to other allergic diseases e.g. asthma and food allergies. The numbers of staff and resources requested are the minimum needed to ensure that this project and the associated scientific studies are conducted to the very highest international standards.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Research design: We are proposing a phase II randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Study population: Adults (aged 18 years or over) with moderate-severe allergic rhinitis caused by grass pollen. Planned interventions: The active intervention will be seven two-weekly intradermal injections of grass pollen allergen at low dose (10 Biological Units; equivalent 7 ng of major allergen grass allergen Phl p 5), given before the summer grass pollen season. The control intervention will be a placebo containing histamine, the dose of which will be reduced over the seven injections. Proposed outcome measures: The primary outcome will be a combined symptom and medication score for each participant, as recommended by World Allergy Organization guidelines. Secondary outcomes will include separate symptom and medication scores, together with a quality of life score validated for allergic rhinitis. Assessment and follow up: Clinical outcomes will be assessed during the 2013 summer grass pollen season. Proposed sample size: A power calculation for the primary outcome has been performed by the NIHR Research Design Service based on data from a trial of subcutaneous immunotherapy. This estimates that 90 subjects will give 90% power to detect a difference in the primary outcome between active and placebo treated subjects (Mann Whitney U test), with allowance for a 10% drop out rate. For this calculation, the symptom and medication score improvement was conservatively estimated at 20% less than that previously reported with subcutaneous immunotherapy, but still at a level considered to be clinically meaningful. Statistical analysis: Full statistical description will be analysed. For each of the variables analysed, univariate descriptive statistics provide an overview of the data. Continuous variables will be presented as median and interquartile range unless otherwise stated. For categorical variables, frequency counts and percentages will be presented as summary statistics for the subgroups of interest. To compare study groups, we will use the Mann?Whitney U-test for continuous variables, and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. The primary outcome will be analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test between active and placebo groups. Similar analyses will be conducted for secondary (symptom scores, medication scores) and mechanistic outcomes (cell counts in biopsies, antibody titres). A secondary analysis based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models will be also constructed to evaluate the change in quality of life scores to isolate the effect of the intervention on each arm after adjusting for any significantly different baseline characteristics between groups. Project timetables including recruitment rate: This is a 3 year study. All 90 participants will be recruited during a 5 month period. The intensive intervention and monitoring phases will last approx. 7 months. Subjects will undergo follow-up tests over the next 12 months to assess the duration of the desensitisation effect. Skin biopsies and blood samples will be collected for mechanistic investigations performed during the 2nd and 3rd years of the project.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>590599</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5ACAA2A9-EEEA-4323-8143-DF08297FF792</gtr:id><gtr:title>Repeated low-dose intradermal allergen injection suppresses allergen-induced cutaneous late responses.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0f75c3ebc74ea287044d5854fdf4f36f"><gtr:id>0f75c3ebc74ea287044d5854fdf4f36f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rotiroti G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0091-6749</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56cb14e772e336.59277635</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05F022C7-C441-404B-ABA4-74AC6E0FA54F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Intradermal grass pollen immunotherapy increases T2 and IgE responses and worsens respiratory allergic symptoms.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae4dd47db7783e4124815b0fc56a367d"><gtr:id>ae4dd47db7783e4124815b0fc56a367d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Slovick A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0091-6749</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bd6007db8919.19304320</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>715EB0E6-FFDF-4536-B717-055BB9A885FE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protocol for a double-blind randomised controlled trial of low dose intradermal grass pollen immunotherapy versus a histamine control on symptoms and medication use in adults with seasonal allergic rhinitis (PollenLITE).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Clinical and translational allergy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae4dd47db7783e4124815b0fc56a367d"><gtr:id>ae4dd47db7783e4124815b0fc56a367d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Slovick A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-7022</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_23793_23_23965180</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_12038</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
