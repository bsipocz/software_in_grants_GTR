It aims to contribute to the debate about how we can better understand the impacts, for individuals and for society, of engaging in arts and cultural activity. It looks in particular at dance and ageing, and takes as a case study an Elders dance group, Grand Gestures. This group of men and women aged 57 to 87 meet for a weekly dance class, perform as a dance company, and also share their skills as volunteers in residential care homes, where they work with people with dementia. The researcher, an older dancer herself, will participate in, observe and interview the dance group over a five month period. The investigation focuses in particular on the significance of bodily awareness senses such as touch, sense of movement (kinaesthetic sensation), sense of where the body is located (proprioception), and physical empathy within the dance group's activity, their individual and personal development, and their interactions with others, including dance interactions and wider civic and social engagements. These sensory aspects of dance are an important and tangible aspect of the experience of dancing, but are not often talked about or evaluated, and the project aims to find some creative new ways of 'speaking' of them not just through words, but also through performance and other media such as film. It will also reflect on the potential usefulness of its particular approach for the evaluation of arts and cultural activity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

1. Equal Arts (project Partner), a third sector organisation.
2. Public and private sector organisations working in partnership with Equal Arts: primarily residential care homes, but also sheltered accommodation schemes, GPs and hospitals, community venues, arts and cultural venues, local authorities, and a range of older people's organisations.
3. Arts organisations and artists working in the fields of creative ageing, particularly dance and ageing. 
4. Members of Grand Gestures Dance Group.
5. The wider ageing population.

How will they benefit?

The project partners, Equal Arts will benefit in the following ways:

By helping to fomulate a specific language through which to talk about elders dance and its value, the research will help to raise the profile and status of Equal Arts' field within academic, scientific and health communities and the population at large.

It will provide an academic focus and support to the work.

It will help to inform their training and support for artists.

It will offer new channels for the dissemination of information regarding the role of movement and its potential value for the ageing population.

It will offer new approaches to evaluation.

It will consolidate its partnership with the University of Sunderland to their mutual benefit in devising further collaborations for research with social and academic impact.

Public and private sector organisations will benefit as follows:

There will be a direct benefit to the residential care homes that work with Grand Gestures from the group's engagement in reflective practice, coming from their enhanced skills. This will benefit both residents and care staff in receipt of training from Equal Arts.

Arts organisations and artists will benefit as follows: 

The project will contribute to ongoing debates about the nature 
and value of dance for elders, and to raising the profile of this work. 

This will have International and national impact through Equal Arts' networks (e.g. Creating a New Old (Dublin); The Dance Exchange (USA), MADE (Mature Artists Dance Experience); The Arts &amp;amp; Dementia Network. Through these networks there is the possibility for much wider social impact, nationally and internationally.

Members of Grand Gestures Dance Group will benefit as follows: 

through the academic focus on and support of their work, the project will give these elder dancers opportunities to reflect on their creative practice and participate in the dissemination of results through workshops and performance, thus contributing to their wellbeing, quality of life and creative output.

The wider ageing public will benefit:
 
A direct contribution to the nation's health and culture comes with the dissemination of information about new approaches to ageing, alternative representations of what it means to be old, and the value of engaging in arts and cultural activity. This all has impact on the health and wellbeing of the ageing population, enhancing quality of life and creative output. 

The researcher and research participants will benefit:

There is potential for skill sharing between researcher, artist and research participants. The researcher will deepen her ethnographic skill base and its sensory dimensions through engagement in this cutting-edge dance practice (informed, for example, by the artist's international links as a Winston Churchill Fellow). 

Timescale

Many of the above impacts will be delivered within the timescale of the project, (January to May 2014), through the processes of the research and the initial publication of findings. Longer term impacts will be delivered through the development of the partnership between the University and Equal Arts, and through the Principal Investigator's continued development of this line of enquiry into future publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31795</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Equal Arts</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Equal Arts</gtr:description><gtr:id>0D0463E7-AF17-4F42-932D-0D775BCA7722</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference paper and performance: Winter, T. and Turner P. with Grand Gestures elders dance group: (2015) 'The Happening Generation: Elder dancers reinvent the Happening in neoliberal times', Media Communications and Cultural Studies Conference, University of Northumbria, 7-9 January.

Promotion of the project through Equal Arts' international and national networks.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The project is disseminating information and methodologies regarding the particular role of movement and its effects on the bodymind and wellbeing of Equal Arts project participants.

It is helping to formulate a specific language with which to talk about this work so helping it to gain a greater acceptance within academic, scientific, and health communities. This in turn will be beneficial in raising the profile of elder arts and in securing future funding to develop and extend the work.

It is helping to inform Equal Arts' training and support for artists, and approaches to evaluation.

It is assisting Grand Gestures to implement and adapt new practices and giving them a reflective context within which to think, talk and express their opinions. Giving the older artist and cultural participant agency in this way is key to Equal Arts' philosophy.

The project gives Equal Arts voice and an academic focus as to how we talk about the changes that are implicit in the ageing process. To make change at all you first have to notice what is going on around you and inside you and this project has been instrumental in working with Grand Gestures as they change themselves and move to change society's attitudes and assumptions of what it means to age.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>cultural value project blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>345EEC1D-3375-4AB4-BDA3-9F0EE8338149</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article was published online.

The purpose of the symposium was to explore the relationship between art, participation and Higher Education, and the delegates were artist practitioners who work in participatory settings, and representatives from the Higher Education and Third sectors.

Dr Trish Winter and artist Paula Turner gave a joint performed presentation to symposium delegates. The research project participants, Grand Gestures Dance Collective, also gave an accompanying performance. The talk offered reflections, from the point of view of the artist, on the process of working with an academic as part of a research project and aimed to demystify this process for other practitioners and inspire them to consider working in this way and exploring partnerships with HE.

There was a lively discussion and many delegates suggested ideas for how they would like to work with academic researchers. 25% of delegates who returned feedback forms thought that this presentation was the 'most useful' thing about the conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca534f828550.86089114</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>8100</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Evaluation funding Jack Drum Arts</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Youth Music</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>3A7CEC18-183C-4E09-9730-D991F1CC0610</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d855aca53433.17023075</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>34494</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University QR</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Sunderland</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>CultureMap 2285</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>1F60583F-3C47-4BB4-8AC3-300EE343C36B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d85701c960f3.63075979</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Two reports have been written and submitted: the final project report that forms part of the AHRC Cultural Value Project; a 'Plain English' report speaking to the communities of practice around elders dance and participatory arts.

Impacts arising from the reports, from dissemination and public engagement activities, and from the research process.

1. Use in the field of Arts Evaluation. 

As a result of reading the draft report, Tim Joss (AESOP) reports that he has modified some of the outcomes and categories of the AESOP framework for arts evaluation.

2. Use by the project partners, Equal Arts. The report is being used:
? to disseminate information and methodologies in the elder arts regarding the particular role of movement and its impact on the bodymind and wellbeing of those involved. 

? to assist in formulating a specific language with which to talk about this work so allowing it to gain a greater acceptance within academic, scientific, and health communities and raising the profile of elder arts towards securing future funding to develop and extend the work.

? It is feeding into the development of their training and support for artists, and approaches to evaluation.

3. Use by the project participants. 

? The participants have reported that the research has given them a reflective context within which to think, talk and express their opinions about their practice. This is an impact of the research process, rather than just the findings.

4.. Use by the project artist: The project artist has reported that the research process has given her a reflective framework within which to develop her work, and helped her to identify her model of practice. This is assisting her in developing her work, marketing it, communicating about it to clients in the care and education sectors, and developing funding bids. She has written about this in our joint authored article (Turner and Winter, 2015)

5. Use in the professional development and training of artists working in participatory settings. The research findings have been used in the development and delivery of short CPD courses by ArtWorks North East, and are informing the development of curriculum for a new University of Sunderland MA in Participatory Arts and Media. This will provide an opportunity for practitioners to engage in professional development at postgraduate level. The MA was validated in 2016 and will begin in 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>19BAAA52-AD2C-41E2-85AE-8B4E5707E900</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447dc876cebd7.66909816</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research was undertaken with the Grand Gestures Elders Dance Group based in Gateshead in North East England, and in partnership with the charity Equal Arts. It has three aims: 
firstly, to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of cultural value by attending to the place of bodily ('somatic') sensation as an important part of the cultural experience of Grand Gestures; secondly, to identify ways of articulating somatic sensory experience - ways that will be both subtle and useful for the purposes of evaluation; and thirdly, to examine the usefulness of a 'somatic ethnographic' approach for the consideration of cultural value. 

Key Findings: 
1. Grand Gestures has to be understood in relation to its political, cultural and artistic contexts; lottery funding; the 'elder arts' movement and the bodies of artistic work that converge in dance improvisation practices. 
2. The cultural value of Grand Gestures is understood from multiple perspectives including those of the funders the Big Lottery, its parent organisation Equal Arts, the dancers and the artist. 
3. Somatic sensation is a key element of Grand Gestures and the research identifies three key related aspects of the practice: the cultivation of heightened somatic awareness; connectedness; and 'being in the moment'. These feed directly into the individual and social values that are enshrined in the aims of the lottery funded Creativity Matters project that encompasses Grand Gestures. 
4. The question of how to articulate the experience of somatic sensation for the purposes of evaluation was approached through the ethnographic investigation of how the members of Grand Gestures 'speak' of their somatic experience through writing, painting, drawing, pottery, photography and film. 
5. The methodology of somatic ethnography brings some challenges but it also offers access to dimensions of cultural experience that can be missed by other methods of evaluation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. in the cultural value debate, as a contribution to the AHRC cultural value project;

She has described this in a publication co-authored with the PI, in the magazine of her professional body, (Turner and Winter, 2015). The process of contributing to the research has improved her skill level: 'I have become clearer, bolder and braver about what I do' (2015: 26). It has contributed to her quality of professional life: 'I therefore get a sense of endorsement and of belonging to a wider realm, which is often lacking in the world of the freelance artist'' (ibid.). This artist works in participatory settings with, for example, care homes, hospices, people with dementia, active elders, and schools. She is also influential on international practice on elder arts, particularly through her status as a Churchill Fellow.
