This type of storage is a method of mediating climate change, and is already used throughout the oil industry during removal of oil from reservoirs. Many of these reservoirs can then be used to store CO2 in supercritical form. However, there are many environmental concerns about the implications of a CO2 leak from these sites into the marine environment. This project has started to ascertain, what happens to the carbon that is released from a leak, and how it affects the biogeochemical functioning of marine systems. In addition, the project has entered the next stage which is to use metagenomics to identify the presence of bacteria that use CO2. It is anticipated that this technique will lead to development of a 'fingerprint' identification which could indicate a CO2 leak from DNA analysis of a sediment sample. To do this, we have developed a laboratory scale testing facility to simulate a leak of CO2 from a storage facility, and intensive sampling (biogeochemical and molecular / microbial) has allowed us to understand the response of natural systems, as well as quantifying ecosystem effects. It is likely that the metagenomics advances will play an important role in future monitoring for carbon capture storage sites.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have been presented at national and international conferences, and we have three manuscripts in draft (one has already been invited for submission to Trends in Biotechnology) and a doi exists for a previous draft of this (doi:10.5194/bgd-12-8909-2015). This work is still ongoing on the metagenomics side, and we expect another two papers to follow. We have been contacted by one of the main oil companies (Shell) about using our facilities for future experiments, and are in discussion with a team of scientists from Japan about future collaborations. We are hosting these Japanese visitors at the end of May 2016 for a short intensive sampling visit focused on carbon capture storage monitoring techniques.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BD58E255-AE9B-4CEB-916D-8B9A248B8683</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>57023f4da632a1.36091396</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/research/projects/143935/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>99AFA2B7-98A3-47DC-B735-B5F6F3E81288</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reviews and synthesis: Carbon capture and storage monitoring &amp;acirc;?? an integrated biological, biophysical and chemical approach</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biogeosciences Discussions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/545bde6a9fa09a4cc6c12284d6895f5f"><gtr:id>545bde6a9fa09a4cc6c12284d6895f5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hicks N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56fccfb8547305.89829525</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C4246AA6-3EA2-48D7-B720-6E8A62E3AA09</gtr:id><gtr:title>Leakage of carbon dioxide from a simulated sub-seabed carbon capture and storage reservoir : potential impacts on benthic biogeochemistry</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e67907e949b952119e00cbc50b5b7264"><gtr:id>e67907e949b952119e00cbc50b5b7264</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor Peter J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5703a334cbb4c1.41414094</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A4847C9D-AC7D-42D8-9F1A-F61C23D166A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Using Prokaryotes for Carbon Capture Storage.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trends in biotechnology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/545bde6a9fa09a4cc6c12284d6895f5f"><gtr:id>545bde6a9fa09a4cc6c12284d6895f5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hicks N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0167-7799</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c665190d1be7.48616496</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L022958/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5705566-FCD9-4E90-A1F6-458BBDED816E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Carbon Capture &amp; Storage</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
