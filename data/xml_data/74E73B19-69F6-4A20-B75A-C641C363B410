In 2014, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India (GOI) launched a comprehensive National Adolescent Health Programme-Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK), to emphasize on community-based health promotion and strengthening preventive, diagnostic and curative service across health system related to 6 strategic priorities. RKSK interventions, which include a Peer Educator (PE) Programme component, are being implemented in a phased manner; the first phase targets 213 selected High Priority Districts in 28 states of India. The PE programme, rolling out in 2016, is designed to provide life-skills, increase knowledge and awareness among PEs and adolescents of: their needs under six strategic priorities and the availability of services and care at Adolescent Friendly Health Clinics (AFHC), which should lead to increased adolescents' attendance at AFHCs.
The proposed research aims to undertake impact and process evaluation of PE Intervention in 2 selected States of India. This implementation research will focus on evaluating impact and process of implementing PE programme. Process evaluation will aid in understanding implementation, causal mechanisms and the factors that shape desired outcomes. Surveys will study equitable coverage and implementation cost of PE intervention and these data will be summed up to develop vertical and horizontal scale up strategy to expand PE intervention at National and regional level. The outcomes of this implementation research will provide vital insights on effective components, processes and context that maximize the potential of PE Intervention and that need to be scaled up at all India level. They will also inform the field of implementation science for adolescent health and fill the evidence gap of 'What works in PE intervention-for whom, why and under what circumstances'?
Project aims:
1) Evaluate the Process of PE intervention to understand implementation, causal mechanisms and context of the PE programme of the RKSK in two Indian states.
2) Evaluate the effect of the PE intervention on primary outcomes at adolescent (knowledge, attitudes, life skills, practices) and parental levels (attitudes, communication skills) and impacts on PE (leadership and communication skills) and on AFHCS (trends in attendance numbers).
3) Provide specific guidance to MoHFW, GOI, and more generic guidance to other countries, on modifying, scaling up and sustaining the PE intervention.
This project aim has 2 sub questions:
i.What were the costs of implementing the PE intervention and how did costs associate with the quality of the intervention and its outcomes? 
ii.What PE intervention components need to be prioritised for horizontal and vertical scale up at state and national level?
The evaluation will be guided by MRC's framework for conducting process evaluations. A mixed-methods design will be used to investigate implementation, mechanisms of impact and context and to assess impact of this intervention. Data will be collected through adolescent, PE and parent surveys, process measures and qualitative data collection methods along with routine RKSK data. The outcomes of the study will be presented at state scale up, national and regional dissemination workshops to various stakeholders including researchers, public health practitioners, programme managers, academicians, policy makers and state-level programme functionaries to highlight barriers to be addressed as well as opportunistic use of enablers in various settings to reach desired adolescent health outcomes. Apart from its applicability in India, the outcomes will be of relevance to other countries in the South East Asia Region, as several are adopting the GOI's RKSK framework to design their adolescent health programmes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>India is home to 243 million adolescents, yet they remain an understudied population in India with lack of data on the health indicators for this age group and current levels of knowledge on adolescent health issues and effective approaches on reaching marginalized adolescents. In 2014, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India launched a comprehensive National Adolescent Health Programme (Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram-RKSK), to emphasize on community-based health promotion and strengthening preventive, diagnostic and curative service across health system related to 6 strategic health priorities. RKSK includes a peer educator (PE) programme, which seeks to ensure that adolescents benefit from sustained peer education and is expected to improve knowledge, attitudes and life skills of adolescents. The PE programme is also expected to change parental and community norms towards the need for adolescent friendly health services, leading to increased attendance to Adolescent Friendly Health Clinics (AFHCs) and subsequently positive adolescent health outcomes. This study will evaluate the impact and process of PE intervention as an integrated component of the RKSK and also explore its interaction with other RKSK components. It will further undertake economic analysis of costs related to implementing PE intervention for guiding scale up. This implementation research will be conducted in 4 high priority districts of 2 Indian states (2 each in Madhya Pradesh &amp;amp; Andhra Pradesh). Mixed methods approach will evaluate the process of the PE programme and its effects on primary outcomes at the adolescent (knowledge, attitudes, life skills, practices) and parental (attitudes, communication) levels as well as impact on PE skills and attendance at AFHCs. The research project also aims to provide guidance to MoHFW on modifying, scaling up and sustaining the PE programme and share findings with countries adapting RKSK.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study will evaluate the implementation of the Peer Educator programme under India's National Adolescent Health Programme - Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) through feedback on quality improvement, delivery costs, health seeking behavior outcomes and issues of equity. Since the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India (GOI) is implementing RKSK, which is an evolving programme, and is implementing partner on this research, the outcomes of this research is expected to provide a basis for MOHFW to develop a National Scale up strategy for improved PE programme within RKSK, to reach a larger number of adolescents, more equitably and in a sustainable manner. It will further provide a more generic guidance to other countries, on modifying, scaling up and sustaining the PE intervention.

The timelines of this study coincide with the roll out of the PE programme under RKSK in 2016 and provides an excellent opportunity to assess the PE programme to provide important lessons for decision makers in India and similar interventions in other low-and middle-income countries. 

MoHFW-GOI has been involved in these research discussions from the inception of this study. As a partner in this research, they will also be ultimate users of research outcomes. Vertical and horizontal scale up strategy developed as part of this study will be easily adopted by government for expanding PE programme in other non RKSK districts and remaining states of India. Principal Investigators of this study are appropriately positioned as members of MoHFW's Technical Review Group (TRG) for RKSK to disseminate outcomes of this research with other experts on the TRG and will work with the government for any proposed midcourse corrections necessary for RKSK scale up.

This evaluation provides a unique opportunity to understand impact of peer educators beyond its traditional utilization in the area of sexual and reproductive health to broader issues for adolescent health as enlisted under RKSK priorities and to understand interactions of PE intervention with other components of RKSK. Given that the PE programme under RKSK is a community-based intervention led by adolescents and intended for adolescents, the proposed research will assess adolescents as both beneficiaries and implementers. Therefore, the project will offer relevant community engagement and involve the intended beneficiaries on both the community and systems ends. To maximize the impact of PE intervention, a Community Advisory Board (CAB) at each study site will be formed. CAB will include adolescents, PEs, parents and community members, to ensure smooth implementation of intervention, enhance acceptance of RKSK and AFHCs and aid in scale up of PE intervention. 


The results and outcomes of this implementation research will also be disseminated to multiple stakeholders including the participants of this study, public health scientists and practitioners, programme managers, academicians, policy makers and state-level programme functionaries. The outcomes of this research are expected to inform global adolescent health science and provide evidence informed programme and policy recommendations for improving adolescent health.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>673520</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P011446/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>90487A08-C473-4CEB-B6D9-011A74AD06CF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.4  Research design and methodologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
