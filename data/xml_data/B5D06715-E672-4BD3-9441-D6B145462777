We will identify, analyse and compare key controversies in the two countries in which the media construct public images of different religions and their members. This will be supported by the development of a matrix for comparing media datasets which, in addition to its use in our own contexts, will provide the foundation for further comparative analysis in other countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the Nordic countries.&lt;br />&lt;br />The collaboration is based on twice-yearly meetings and the following core activities:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the development of a strategy for comparing media portrayals of religion and religious identity in the UK and Canada&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>opportunities for postgraduates and early career researchers through active participation in both the research and the network&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>knowledge exchange and impact activities including religion and media workshops (with journalists, religious correspondents, religious communications specialists etc), and contributions to policy through collaboration with existing users&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>international dissemination of the research results and extension of the partnership to researchers beyond UK/Canada.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This collaboration is expected to benefit stakeholders from the following groups: 

(a) Members of the media with an interest in or responsibilities for reporting on religion, including journalists, religious affairs correspondents, newspaper editors, programme makers; 
(b) Representatives of public bodies, e.g. equality and human rights organisations, policy agencies, think tanks, and campaigning NGOs; 
(c) Public relations and communications officers of faith-based organisations; 
(d) General public.

Three approaches to impact will be taken. 

1. The Principal Applicant will contribute to capacity building in KE and impact by sharing UK intelligence and expertise with Canadian, Australian and New Zealand researchers. Although this will not have an immediate non-academic impact, we expect it to have benefits in the longer term for social and cultural research in terms of user engagement and public awareness strategy (given that the Religion and Diversity Project continues until 2017). 

2. Through workshops and roundtable discussions we will engage directly - in both Canada and the UK - with non-academic stakeholders. By bringing together different constituencies (from the media, policy and faith-based organisations) and giving them an opportunity to meet, raise their own issues, and listen to each other, we aim to help facilitate effective working relationships between key religious representatives, media and policy makers. This three-way exchange will also contribute to our selection of research case studies and to how we analyse and interpret them. Simultaneously we will build on existing relationships of trust between ourselves and our contacts in the media and public bodies that will then form the basis not only for placing stories in the media about religion and diversity arising from our research, but for developing future research partnerships. 

3. The research will also be disseminated in a showcase event (UK) and a public lecture (Ottawa) to which media professionals, representatives of faith based organisations, campaigning bodies, and a wider public will be invited. Briefings on media portrayals of religion and their implications for equality and diversity policy will be prepared in conjunction with external partners. Findings and case studies will be made available in web postings and alerts.

These interactions will be monitored and their benefits evaluated in 2014 at the end of this phase of the partnership. In particular we will consider the value added to user engagement and social and cultural impact by an international collaboration of this kind.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22088</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Ottawa</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Religion, Discourse and Diversity: media workshops and project</gtr:description><gtr:id>AF230D1E-AE27-42E2-818F-911325653B03</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Comparative, international research project on 'Religion on an Ordinary Day' (not planned or costed in the original grant).

We met annually to present our research and findings, and also presented at conferences in the UK and Canada. We led graduate training sessions (on media and impact), held a panel with media professionals, and contributed to teacher and pupil resources and lessons on religion and media.

1. Public anxieties about religion and atheism can be gauged from mainstream media reporting around the world. 
2. Occasionally, a global event (e.g. an act of terrorism involving a religious group or a war in the Middle East) will be reported simultaneously in national newspapers in different countries, but more common is reporting on national issues.
3. Religion rarely makes it onto the front page of newspapers.
4. Much reporting on religion is negative in tone, but local papers, in particular, are more positive in dealing with local religious groups.
5. Some key contentious issues were the Charter of Values (Canada), marriage equality (Australia), Christian diversity (Finland) and the niqab ban in UK courtrooms.
6. We devised a novel research strategy. Our principal focus was the treatment of religion in the newspapers on 'an ordinary day'. Arguably there are no ordinary days (the 17 Sept 2014 was the day of the Scottish Referendum). However, selecting a single day for the collection and analysis of references was revealing in showing how religion was reported and how much coverage of it there was in any national setting.
7. Our focus on religion and media provided us with a platform for talking to school teachers and pupils, postgraduates and other colleagues about (a) how religion is treated in the media, and (b) getting research on religion into the media and engaging with journalists and media producers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Researchers from other countries could adopt the comparative methodology we devised for analysing media references to religion 'on an ordinary day'.

Our tips for academics engaging with the media could be exploited by other researchers.

The teacher/pupil resources developed in the UK during the project could be used more widely.
