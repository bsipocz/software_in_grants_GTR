Formed largely in the years 1900-1950 as part of a much more extensive collection donated to the city of Glasgow in 1944, the stained glass at the heart of the Burrell collection is of exceptional quality and world-wide significance. Assisted by Glasgow-based collector and dealer Grosvenor Thomas (1856-1923), Burrell was able to acquire treasures from some of Europe's most important sites and monuments, including Abbot Suger's St Denis, St Peter Mancroft in Norwich, and the churches of Rouen. Thomas was at the same time supplying glass to major US collectors, including George D. Pratt, Edsel Ford and the Metropolitan Museum. The third figure in this extraordinary relationship was glazier and stained glass restorer Wilfred Drake (1879-1948), through whose hands most of the Burrell Collection passed. Thomas and Drake formed a business partnership that was continued after Thomas's death by his son, Roy Grosvenor Thomas. Based in New York, Roy Grosvenor Thomas turned the business into a truly transatlantic trade, with Drake acting as British anchorman. The triumvirate continued to collect throughout the Second World War and the acquisition in 1939 of stained glass from Boppard in Germany from the collection of the bankrupt William Randolph Hearst made Burrell's collection 'the finest private collection in existence'. The finest jewels in Burrell's stained glass crown have been on public display since the opening of the new Burrell Collection building in 1983. Despite the scholarly interest focussed on the collection at this time (notably Marks 1985), no complete and in depth survey of the collection has yet been attempted. The Museum's initiation of a new inventory project and comprehensive condition survey now provides an opportunity to address this lacuna and to open up the collection for public access and enjoyment as never before.\n\nThrough the exploration of the relationship between Burrell and his agents, drawing on Burrell's purchase books, the Museum's extensive archive of correspondence between Burrell, Thomas and Drake, together with the newly accessible stock books of Thomas &amp;amp; Drake, recently purchased by the Worshipful Company of Glaziers, this project will explore the origins of the collection and its relationship with the collecting activity of other great collectors, connoisseurs, dealers and Museum curators. It will reveal in detail the connections between the panels in the Burrell collection and related pieces in other museums (notably the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert in London). For the first time the role of the restorer in the formation of the great museum collections of the world will be examined. The project will shed new light on this world-ranking collection, enhancing the enjoyment and understanding of museum visitors, while at the same time contributing to the process of exploring 'digital repatriation' of the collection. \n\nWorks cited or refered to in the preparation of this application:\nCannon, Linda, Stained Glass in the Burrell Collection (Edinburgh, 1991)\nHayward, Jane, Shepard, Mary and Clark, Cynthia, English and French Medieval Stained Glass in the Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (London &amp;amp; Turnhout, 2003), 2 vols.\nJournal of the British Society of Master Glass Painters 1:1 (1924), 29-31, Obituary of Grosvenor Thomas\nMarks, Richard, Burrell: Portrait of a Collector (Glasgow 1985, rev 1988)\nWells, William, Stained and Painted Glass [in the] Burrell Collection (Glasgow, 1962)\nStained and Painted Heraldic Glass [in the] Burrell Collection (Glasgow, 1962)\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of this research will have significant benefits to Glasgow Museums. It will enable a greater understanding of Sir William Burrell's collecting and of his stained glass collection in particular. This will inform and influence the planned redisplay of the Burrell Collection and will impact on the future provision of interpretation and learning programmes within the museum. The public will therefore gain a greater understanding of Burrell and his collection. \n\nThe research will also provide a significant contribution to scholarship in the history of collecting. Sir William Burrell is one of the major collectors and benefactors in the 20th century, but detailed knowledge of his collecting practice is still limited. The project will significantly advance our understanding of Burrell and will help to inform future research in this field. \n\nThe research will inform the ongoing work on the inventory and cataloguing of Burrell's stained glass collection, which is being carried out in partnership with Glasgow Museums and the University of York. The ultimate aim is to publish a complete catalogue as part of the Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi series. The results of the proposed CDA will significantly advance the scholarship necessary to complete this project. \n\nGlasgow's stained glass collection is seen as one third of an internationally distributed collection, the other parts being held by the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The proposed CDA will provide a greater understanding of the wider collection and contribute to the development of a closer working relationship between the three institutions.\n\nThe proposed research will help to identify common elements within the three major collections with the possibility of digitally re-uniting panels which have become dispersed. This opens up the possibility of exploring the issue of 'digitally repatriating' parts of the collection to their original sites. \n\nThe proposed CDA will enhance the reputation of both Glasgow Museums and the University of York in stained glass scholarship and will lead to further opportunities for research collaboration in the future. \n\nThe project will also help to establish a greater international reputation for the Burrell Collection. This will have a knock on effect in terms of promoting cultural tourism to Glasgow. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54916</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024399/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
