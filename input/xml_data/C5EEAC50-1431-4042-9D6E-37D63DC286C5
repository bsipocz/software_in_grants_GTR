Scottish policy on the funding of higher education and on widening participation will be examined. Other relevant areas of public policy, such as immigration and employment, will also be explored. The future of shared services, including UCAS and the UK Research Councils will be investigated, as will the future of UK organisations with Scottish branches such as the NUS and the UCU.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>During the course of the project, UCAS data will be used to explore the cross-border flow of students between Scotland, the rest of the UK and Europe. Key informant interviews will be used to examine different visions of the future of Scottish higher education. Public engagement activities will include a series of think tanks and research briefings. There will be a particular focus on hearing the views of young people and a short film and teaching materials will be produced.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the fellowship?
We envisage that the research findings, knowledge exchange events and outputs of this research will be of interest and use to a very wide audience, including the following:
(1) University, college and school students and staff and the general public;
(2) Organisations and projects with an interest in widening access to education to promote social mobility, such as the the Scottish Funding Council Access and Inclusion Committee, the RAISE project at the University of Glasgow and the LEAPS project at the University of Edinburgh, the Sutton Trust and the Independent Commission on Fees;
(3) Children in Scotland, Commissions for Children and Young People in the different parts of the UK, the Scottish Youth Parliament and the Equality and Human Rights Commission;
(4) Communities of practice such as widening access officers and disabled students' advisers
(5)Trades unions such as the UCU, the EIS, the TUC and the STUC;
(6)The National Union of Students;
(7) Civil servants across the UK and European Commission staff (e.g. those in DG-EAC)
(8) Arms-length agencies operating in the devolved administrations and at UK level such as the Office for Fair Access, UCAS, the UK Border Agency, the Funding Councils and the Quality Assurance Agency.
(9) Academics in education, social policy, politics, equality, law and employment.

How will they benefit from this fellowship?
The groups identified above will benefit from the fellowship in the following ways:
(1) Access to well researched working papers and briefings which will provide essential information to inform the debate on independence;
(2) The opportunity to attend a range of stimulating and participatory events. We aim to involve policy-makers, academics, the general public and younger people, particularly those who are first time voters, with the aim of increasing knowledge of the key issues. 
(3) Younger people will be encouraged to engage with the issues through events and outputs designed with their interests in mind. These include the final glossy publication, resource materials, a short film and a podcast; 
(4) Policy-makers, academics, the general public and young people will be interested in the analysis of UCAS data since 1996, which provides insight into cross-border student flows under devolution and possible future trends following independence.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>306210</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>One of the aims of the project is to promote the engagement of young people in the independence debate. The film, Our Future: Young People's Views on Higher Education in Scotland, involves discussions with young people aged 14 to 17, from Edinburgh, Fife, Glasgow, the Western Isles and West Lothian; in total, 89 young people participated in making the film. It is available to view either in full (20 minutes) or as five individual sections: 
- Part 1: Introduction and the benefits of HE
- Part 2: Funding of HE
- Part 3: Cross border flow of students
- Part 4: Widening access to HE
- Part 5: The referendum on independence.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DBA33C77-DB02-4416-AB3A-CF0D3F4A461C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The teaching materials and a copy of the DVD were sent to all secondary schools in Scotland (approximately 400 schools). It was previewed to policy makers and practitioners at our third think tank in January 2014, and was also available to view on Youtube. The 20 minute version of the full length film has been viewed 537 times (73% of these were outside the UK). It was also available to view as individual clips: 
? Part 1, including the introduction and a discussion of the benefits of HE has been viewed 115 times (67% of views were in the UK)
? Part 2 on funding 99 times (53% of views in the UK)
? Part 3 on cross border flow of students 51 times (84% of views in UK)
? Part 4 on widening access 78 times (80% of views in UK)
? Part 5 on young people's views of independence has been viewed 1,255 times (71% of views in UK)

Youtube analytics show that the clips have been viewed predominantly in the UK. Reach outside of the UK has also been significant, with clips viewed in 53 countries: France, Germany, Austria, Sweden, the USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Australia, Norway, Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, Portugal, Ukraine, Ireland, Mexico, Denmark, Latvia, India, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Estonia, Cyprus, Serbia, Malaysia, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Jamaica, Japan, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Singapore, Hong Kong, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, Tunisia, Poland, Peru, Chile, Philippines, Azerbaijan, Croatia, Nepal, South Korea, Sweden, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Greece. The clip of the full film reached the widest selection of countries outside of the UK (38 in total). Analytics show that views of Part 5 on young people's views of the referendum increased greatly in the week of the referendum. Almost half (47%) of views of Part 2 on funding were from outside the UK. 

The film was shown to social researchers at the Scottish Government as part of a discussion on methodological issues of filming young people. We had the following response about this on 21 August 2014: 
Hi Sarah,
Thank you for coming in this week, in spite of the technical hitches we've had good feedback from those who were there. I watched the Youtube version at home last night to see the whole thing, really it is excellent. Would you mind if we showed it, or part of it at our Away Day to all of our researchers, as I think it's a really good chance to hear directly from people who were research subjects rather than just statistics. I'm not sure what the copyright etc. would be, so if that's an issue for you of course I understand if it's not possible. (We'll be out of the office, so youtube available!)
Best regards

Apart from the comments of relevant policy makers, the research on the net effect of the SNP's no-fee, low-grant policy by Lucy Hunter Blackburn was featured to underline how fees were transferred from poor students to their richer classmates. Sarah Minty's recent research on students' attitude to avoid debts was also noted to support Lucy's comment. The article also underlined Sheila Riddell's comment on the possibility for the SNP to amend the current free fee policy under the pressure of further spending cuts.

The press release was picked up on and reported by a number of newspapers, many of which concentrated on Professor David Bell's presentation which explored the potential for increased numbers of students from the rest of the UK coming to study in an independent Scotland.

CREID's first seminar as part of Professor Sheila Riddell's ESRC Fellowship generated a large amount of coverage in the press and broadcast media. And Professor Riddell's work was cited in a question at First Minister's Questions and was directly commented on by Education Secretary Mike Russell.

The seminar concerned the future of higher education, and explored different policy futures for Scotland, patterns of cross-border student flows and how this might change in the future depending on the nature of constitutional change, the future of research funding and the impact of constitutional change on those who work in Scottish universities. This was a high profile event, with both Michael Russell, Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, Scottish Government and Alistair Carmichael, Secretary of State for Scotland speaking at the event to present their alternative visions for Scottish HE. The event was chaired by Professor Charlie Jeffery. Other speakers included Sir Andrew Cubie, Professor Anton Muscatelli (University of Glasgow), Professor Susan Robertson (University of Bristol), Dave Watson (Unison), Mary Senior (UCU) and David Lott (Universities Scotland). Sarah Minty also showed a preview of the Our Future film at the event (see separate Engagement Activity entry).

The event was accompanied by both a press release and a pre-event briefing (see separate Engagement Activity entry).

The seminar generated a lot of debate at the event itself, and in the wider media, for example it was covered by the BBC (see separate engagement activity entry).

Sarah Minty live-tweeted from the event, and the audience was encouraged to use #HEScot. This was very successful, and there were 387 tweets using this hashtag between 28 January and 3 November, with 338 tweets on the day of the event 87 users.

Asked to respond to a report by Machin, McNally and Wyness (2013, &amp;quot;Education in a Devolved Scotland: A Quantitative Analysis - Report to the ESRC, March 2013, Special Paper No. 30, http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/special/cepsp30.pdf), Professor Raffe noted that factors such as the class system, peer pressure and the way people perceive opportunities were more important than money in attributing inequalities to education. The articles states: 

'But inequalities in education are a reflection of wider society and too deeply rooted for money to be able to do much more than tinker round the edges, Professor Raffe said. 
&amp;quot;How money is spent does make a difference, but when it comes to inequalities it can only make a difference at the margins,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;There are more important factors driving inequalities - the class system, peer pressure, the way people perceive opportunities.&amp;quot;
The Nordic countries and the Netherlands had reduced inequalities and an independent Scotland could conceivably &amp;quot;go down the Nordic route in terms of social policy&amp;quot;, which would have a knock-on effect for education, Professor Raffe said. But whether the Scottish government would choose to take that path - or be able to - was &amp;quot;a big if&amp;quot;, he said.
Curriculum for Excellence was more likely to influence educational outcomes in Scotland than independence, he said.'

The Scotsman also reported Professor Raffe's comments in response to the LSE report: Education 'has failed to improve with devolution', 15 August, http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/education-has-failed-to-improve-with-devolution-1-3046489:

'Professor David Raffe, of the Centre for Educational Sociology at Edinburgh University, said: &amp;quot;It's fair to say education has not improved greatly [since devolution]. Devolution has not made a difference to the rate of progress.

This was also accompanied by a pre-event briefing paper which outlined the key themes to be covered on the day. The press release and the briefing attracted a lot of interest, with news of the seminar run in all the key Scottish daily newspapers. The majority of reports concentrated on the argument that free tuition has not led to wider access to HE for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

In advance of the seminar, Professor Riddell also had an article published in the letters sections of the Holyrood Magazine, which summarised the key themes to be discussed at the ESRC Fellowship seminar, held on the 8th October, 2013 (Major questions over university access, Holyrood Magazine, 7 October 2013, http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20131007_HolyroodMagazine_Major-Qs-over-university-access.pdf)

While discussion with the audience after the film had been shown was not possible due to time constraints, Sarah was approached by a number of delegates at the event who commented on the film and on how refreshing it was to hear the voice of young people directly. 

The film was mentioned in a blog by Dave Watson, Head of Bargaining and Campaigns at Unison, who also spoke at the event: 'I would particularly recommend the film the project has made that captures the views of young people. It is very powerful.' ('Higher education and independence', UnisonDave blog, 29 January 2014, http://unisondave.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/higher-education-and-independence.html)

Sarah Minty was approached by THE to provide comments for an article published on 6 February 2014, 'Clock is ticking: teenagers question sustainability of free tuition' (http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140206_THE_Scottish-ministers-do-the-Highland-mud-sling-over-UK-split.pdf). The article includes quotes from young people interviewed in the film and also includes comments from Sarah Minty:

&amp;quot;Sarah Minty, a research fellow at the Centre for Research in Education Inclusion and Diversity at the University of Edinburgh, who conducted the research, said that &amp;quot;while the majority of young people we spoke with were in favour of free tuitionmany questioned the sustainability of free tuition in the long term&amp;quot;.

Some suggested that students from better-off families could contribute to the cost of their education, although the pupils &amp;quot;were not suggesting that fees should be introduced on a level anywhere near that of England&amp;quot;, she added.

The results are particularly relevant because 16- and 17-year-olds will be allowed to vote in the independence referendum in September.&amp;quot;

This helped promote the film to a wider audience, as can be seen in the increased YouTube traffic around this time for film viewings, which peaked between the 5th and 7th February.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cafd9594026.46329084</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alc1XzblgpE&amp;feature=youtu.be</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog by Riddell, S.

The article states:

'Since devolution, there is no policy that the SNP trumpet more proudly than resisting the move to tuition fees south of the border, and keeping university education completely free of charge. This is flaunted as a triumph of progressive politics: Sturgeon likes to say that fees would have prevented her from going to university.

Yet protecting Scottish students from university tuition fees has led to cuts to student grants, and a &amp;pound;20 million transfer from disadvantaged students to middle-class ones, according to the policy analyst Lucy Hunter Blackburn. The poorer you are in Scotland, the greatest the debt when you graduate: students from households that earn less than &amp;pound;34,000 will typically graduate with between &amp;pound;4,000 to &amp;pound;5,000 more debt than those from families earning more, research from Hunter Blackburn shows. 

The tuition fee policy has also hurt disadvantaged students in another way. Success rates for Scots applying to university have fallen sharply in recent years, and are now well below those for applicants in England or Wales, due to the relatively tight cap on the number of students that Scottish universities can take. This hurts all students but disproportionately affects the most disadvantaged. Meanwhile in England the cap on the number of students universities can take has been removed, benefiting all students but especially the most disadvantaged.

The deleterious consequences of free university tuition extend to school education. &amp;quot;Higher education spending has been maintained whilst spending on schools and colleges has been cut. This is a conscious political decision,&amp;quot; says Sheila Riddell from the University of Edinburgh. The effects can be seen in the investment in schools. Between 2010 and 2013, school spending in Scotland fell by five per cent in real terms from 2010 to 2013 while, in England, it rose by three per cent in real terms between 2010 and 2015.

If the extra cuts forced by the maintenance of free tuition fees are one common theme of Scotland's educational problems, there is another striking one: a lack of accountability. The culture of ubiquitous school league tables is lacking north of Berwick-upon-Tweed.

Scottish education needs &amp;quot;a more robust evidence base,&amp;quot; the OECD report noted, while the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission have said the lack of data impedes analysis of &amp;quot;the effectiveness of different policy interventions at improving social mobility&amp;quot;. It is not merely a bureaucratic issue. &amp;quot;A lack of data means a lack of accountability,&amp;quot; Riddell says. The reluctance to use data to highlight failings in schools partly explains why Scotland has also shied away from the educational reforms that have been pioneered in London and then rolled out in the rest of England, including the Teach First programme and academies.'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>571a057b583bf9.11166934</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/04/snp-has-failed-scotlands-children</gtr:url><gtr:year>2006</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 6: Our Future: what do young people think about Scottish higher education and independence?

Some of the schools had been involved in the research, while others were new to the project. Twenty undergraduate students from Dallas, Texas, who were visiting Edinburgh as part of their studies also attended, having heard about the event from a colleague.

The event was chaired by Dr Rowena Arshad, Head of School at Moray House School of Education. Presenters included team members Sarah Minty, Professor Riddell and Susan Whittaker, as well as Dr Jan Eichhorn from AQMeN who discussed findings of his related research of a survey of 14-17 year old's voting intentions. The aim of the day was to feed back findings of the research with young people, and to provide space for pupils to debate some of the issues with their peers. Five short presentations were interspersed with clips from the Our Future film, and an electronic voting system (known as 'clickers') was used to gauge opinion of young people on the day and to see how that compared to the views of those reported in the research. 

After lunch, pupils were invited to attend three break-out sessions which allowed participants to discuss some of the issues with their peers and then feed back to the floor. At the end of the day, a panel discussion pulled together some of the issues. Panellists included Professor Riddell, Sarah Minty, Gary Paterson (a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament), and two sixth year students - Ramsay from St Joseph's Academy, and Alicia from Douglas Academy in Bearsden.

The event was very well received, and feedback from pupils was particularly positive about the clips from the Our Future film and use of the 'clickers'. Students from the US and Scotland mixed together well and appeared to enjoy the chance to learn about one another's educational systems. In terms of areas for improvement, pupils requested fewer statistics, while teachers hoped for greater integration with the Modern Studies curriculum and exams.

Email from Marie-Frances Hill (teacher at St Joseph's Academy):

'Ramsay was delighted to get your email and the positive feedback from the seminar. The four pupils I took really enjoyed the day-they loved being at the University and particularly enjoyed the fact that it was (to quote them) &amp;quot;really professional without being stuffy&amp;quot;!'

From a teacher: 1) Positives: Presentations were short but very concentrated, presented valid data from numerous sources; excellent opportunities for participation; excellent even-handed moderation of the discussion. 2) Improvements: Has any of the data presented been posted? If so, where? 3) Additional comments: I found this to be an excellent, thorough and thoughtful discussion. I was particularly impressed with the quality of the young people's contributions.

From a pupil: 1) Best things: I really enjoyed the breakout session with Dr. Eichhorn and Sarah Minty; The video was great. I enjoyed hearing the students' opinions; 2) Improvements: I wished there had been more time for the breakout sessions; Explaining foreign terminology for the U.S. visitors; 3) Thank you for your time, it was a very good lecture and I enjoyed it very much.

Another pupil: 1) Best things: I gained more knowledge about the statistics of people who go to higher education from private schools and state schools; I liked interacting with different people such as the students from American universities and finding out the views of people out of Scotland; 2) Improvements: Used the interactive learning device more to let everyone interact, even the people who weren't comfortable asking questions in front of the discussion; Taught more about why some people were voting yes and why some people were voting no, to provide us with more information on independence.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cb762ce5da3.89025621</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/education/rke/centres-groups/creid/news-events/events-in-2014/esrc-fellowship-young-ppl-event</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press coverage of Gill Wyness blog and report, August 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C53D4A51-ABE2-4977-9D50-35AB4AC48392</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gill Wyness from the LSE was a speaker at Seminar 3 on educational inequality and attainment in Scotland.

The coverage of Dr Wyness' work in the press in the weeks leading up to Seminar 3 helped increase the number of delegates signing up for the seminar. It also led to further press coverage and responses from Professor David Raffe (see separate Engagement Activity entry).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545ca896bcaa15.01254853</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/education-in-scotland-performance-in-a-devolved-policy-area/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Schools for Higher Education Programme (SHEP) Best Practice Meeting: Workshop on student finance and funding facilitated by Sarah Minty at the University of Glasgow on 21 April 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>541E6864-3B46-4577-B584-214CC05780C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sarah Minty was invited to run a workshop on student finance.

This focused on the fact that Mike Russell and Alistair Carmichael were due to speak at the seminar. 

In response to the press release and the briefing paper, both Mike Russell and Alistair Carmichael gave press releases and interviews prior to the event. This meant that the seminar generated a substantial amount of press coverage, much of which focused on Mike Russell's comments about UK immigration policy. Press coverage also highlighted the prospect of fee refugees in an independent Scotland if rUK students were no longer charged fees to study in Scotland, which is discussed in the Briefing paper.

Press coverage on the day of the event and immediately after included:

A report from the seminar on the debate around the future of higher education in Scotland was front page of the Times Higher Education on 6 February 2014, with the headline 'Scottish Ministers do the Highland mud-sling over UK split' (http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140206_THE_Scottish-ministers-do-the-Highland-mud-sling-over-UK-split.pdf). David Matthews wrote three articles relating to presentations at the event, which focused on the opposing views of the two ministers as well as presentations by Professor Anton Mascatelli, Dave Watson of Unison and Mary Senior of UCU, and related to the Our Future film. The THE articles included:
? Scottish ministers do the Highland mud-sling over UK split; 
? Size matters, pension funds could suffer in separate state; 
? Clock is ticking: teenagers question sustainability of free tuition.

Sarah Minty was approached by THE to provide comments for the final article, 'Clock is ticking: teenagers question sustainability of free tuition'. The article includes quotes from young people interviewed in the film and also includes comments from Sarah Minty which can be seen below in a clip from the article:

&amp;quot;Sarah Minty, a research fellow at the Centre for Research in Education Inclusion and Diversity at the University of Edinburgh, who conducted the research, said that &amp;quot;while the majority of young people we spoke with were in favour of free tuitionmany questioned the sustainability of free tuition in the long term&amp;quot;.

Some suggested that students from better-off families could contribute to the cost of their education, although the pupils &amp;quot;were not suggesting that fees should be introduced on a level anywhere near that of England&amp;quot;, she added.

The results are particularly relevant because 16- and 17-year-olds will be allowed to vote in the independence referendum in September.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545caf20d5c6e0.13475841</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Projects/34vi_a_ESRCF_Seminar_PR.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release for Seminar 7 dissemination event: 'Influx of students from rest of UK to Scotland unlikely, study says', 24 June 2014.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BEFEE047-6D83-46C6-93A1-509CB36B2744</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The press release included findings from all three strands of the ESRC Fellowship project, and accompanied the publication of three working papers.

In the period leading up to the event, David Matthews of Times Higher Education wrote a story (12th June 2014) summarising different views on the impacts of the referendum on Scottish higher education ('What might independence mean for Scotland's universities?' http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140612_THE_What-might-independence-mean-for-Scotlands-unis.pdf). Among them, our ESRC Fellowship dissemination event was also mentioned, helping to flag up the event to those who had not yet signed up.

Responding to the press release for the event and its associated publications, several newspapers ran stories about the event and its findings. The BBC attended the dissemination event. They wrote a piece for the BBC news website which referred specifically to the findings of Working Paper 5: Key informants' views of higher education in Scotland (by Sheila Riddell): 'Scottish independence: Report details concerns over rest of the UK tuition fees', 24 June 2014, http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140624_BBC_Scottish-independence-Report-details-concerns-over-rUK-tuition-fees.pdf. The seminar was also reported along with interviews with Professor Riddell and Professor Raffe in the BBC Two Scotland programme 'Scotland 2014', broadcast on 24 June 2014. It again highlighted the topic of fees from our research findings: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04835y1

The majority of press coverage focused on tuition fees and whether or not an independent Scotland could continue to charge rUK fees, such as articles in The Guardian by Severin Carrell, 'Scottish universities won't be swamped by English students, says study', 24 June 2014, http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140625_Guardian_Scottish-unis-wont-be-swamped-by-Eng-students-says-study.pdf and The Courier, 'Experts in tuition fees warning', 24 June 2014, http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140624_Courier_Experts-in-tuition-fees-warning.pdf

Based on the findings of the ESRC Fellowship project, an article of The Herald (24th June 2014) cited findings from Working Paper 5 on the key informant interviews with higher education policymakers and stakeholders in Scotland and the rUK. The article also quoted a comment from Sheila Riddell on fees based on the findings: 'University experts: Scotland could not charge rUk tuition fees if it becomes independent': http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140624_HeraldScotland_Uni-experts-Scotland-could-not-charge-rUK-students-tuition-fees-if-it-becomes-independent.pdf. Another article in The Herald by Andrew Denholm focused on a different aspect of the key informant interviews and raised the issue of autonomy and university governance: Universities 'feel threatened', http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140624_HeraldScotland_Universities-feel-threatened.pdf. In response to this article, Mary Senior wrote in the Letters section of the Herald Scotland (25th June 2014) to clarify the stance of the UCU with regard to widening access: 'Letters: Universities are right to demand wider access and to move from academic elitism', http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140625_Herald_Letters-universities-feel-threatened.pdf

Other articles relating to the seminar and its associated working papers included:

Finally, the Times Higher Education also covered the event and its associated working papers. Published on 3 July 2014, it highlighted the worries of Scottish university principals about whether they would continue to draw the same percentage of grant funding from the UK's research council after independence: 'Scots fear losing access to UK research council system', http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140703_THE_Scots-fear-losing-access-to-UK-research-council-system.pdf</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cbab938c9f5.26203977</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Projects/34ix_ESRCF_a_disseminsation_PR.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog by Raffe, D. for The Conversation (16.08.2013): 'UK split over tuition fees is bad news for students'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0F240832-1E63-414E-8DE2-4670C2F67296</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor David Raffe wrote a piece for The Conversation, an online magazine, which provides informed news analysis and commentary to an international readership. The article, The UK split over tuition fees is bad news for students, contributed to the public debate around the future of tuition funding in the UK. It discusses the interconnections between the divergent funding systems of England, Wales and Scotland, and asks who looks after making university accessible to poorer or disadvantaged students from any of the regions?

There was quite a bit of interest on Twitter in relation to the tweet which notified people that The Conversation article had been published, and this was retweeted 6 times. 

Professor Raffe's comments were also reported in The Herald by Andrew Denholm on 16 August: 'Mr Raffe said: In the past, students from the rest of the UK studying in Scotland ... have been disproportionately well-qualified and middle class, often from independent school backgrounds. It would be unhealthy if, after the introduction of higher fees, national differences between students correlated even more strongly with differences in social and educational backgrounds. We need Scottish universities to consider what can be done to widen access not only to those students who live in Scotland, but also to those coming to study here from other parts of the UK.' (Cross-border students 'come from privileged' backgrounds', 16 August 2013, http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/cross-border-students-come-from-privileged-backgrounds.21897366)

As a result of the reporting of The Conversation article, Professor Raffe was asked to write an op-ed piece for The Herald. This was published on 17 August 2013, and discussed the social make up of students who move from their country of domicile to study elsewhere within the UK ('Agenda: UK Government should take blame for university fees dilemma', http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20130816_HeraldScotland_Agenda_UKGovernment-should-take-blame.pdf)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-675243475.1719642b7b5c44</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://theconversation.com/the-uk-split-over-tuition-fees-is-bad-news-for-students-17119</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog by Raffe, D.

The presentations explored some of the pressures affecting decision making on the funding of higher education in Scotland, the rest of the UK and other countries. They also examined the range of policy choices which are available and their consequences. The presentations included time for questions and discussion and there was a lot of interest from the audience. 

The event was filmed by the BBC and appeared on Reporting Scotland at 6.30pm and again at 10.30pm on 22 May. 

The event was accompanied by a press release and by a pre-event briefing paper (see a separate entry for the press release).

As part of this a film was produced, 'Our Future: Young People's Views on Higher Education in Scotland', which includes interviews with young people aged 14 to 17, from Edinburgh, Fife, Glasgow, the Western Isles and West Lothian. A copy of the DVD was sent to all Scottish secondary schools (approximately 400 schools) in early January 2014, accompanied by a set of teaching materials with ideas and activities to encourage discussion among young voters on the future of higher education. 

The film was also available to view on Youtube (full version at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alc1XzblgpE). It was available to watch either in full (20 minutes) or in five shorter sections: Part 1: Introduction and the benefits of HE; Part 2: Funding of HE; Part 3: Cross border flow of students; Part 4: Widening access to HE; Part 5: The referendum on independence.

The film and teaching materials were featured as resources for teachers on a number of websites including: 

? ESRC Social Science for Schools website: 'Resources from the Future of the UK and Scotland programme': 
http://www.socialscienceforschools.org.uk/resources/UK-and-Scotland/resources.aspx 
? Education Scotland website on 'Political Literacy: Referendum Resources': http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/politicalliteracy/learningapproaches/referendum/resources/index.asp

As at 30 Oct 2014, the 20 minute version of the full length film has been viewed 555 times (75% of these were in the UK). It was also available to view as individual clips: 
? Part 1, including the introduction and a discussion of the benefits of HE has been viewed 125 times (67% of views were in the UK)
? Part 2 on funding 105 times (53% of views in the UK)
? Part 3 on cross border flow of students 55 times (84% of views in UK)
? Part 4 on widening access 81 times (80% of views in UK)
? Part 5 on young people's views of independence has been viewed 1,295 times (70% of views in UK)

Youtube analytics show that the clips have been viewed predominantly in the UK, but that they have also had substantial reach outside of the UK. Almost half (47%) of views of Part 2 on funding were from outside the UK, while 30% of Part 5 views were from outside the UK. Reach outside of the UK has also been significant, with clips viewed in 53 countries: France, Germany, Austria, Sweden, the USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Australia, Norway, Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, Portugal, Ukraine, Ireland, Mexico, Denmark, Latvia, India, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Estonia, Cyprus, Serbia, Malaysia, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Jamaica, Japan, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Singapore, Hong Kong, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, Tunisia, Poland, Peru, Chile, Philippines, Azerbaijan, Croatia, Nepal, South Korea, Sweden, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Greece. The clip of the full film reached the widest selection of countries outside of the UK (38 in total). 

Youtube analytics show that views of Part 5 on young people's views of the referendum increased greatly between 31st August and 24 September 2014, when the clip received 603 views, with the greatest number of views received on one day (72) on the 17th September, implying it was being used as a resource by people during the referendum. 

Feedback received from teachers whose pupils participated in the making of the film included:

&amp;quot;Video was fantastic, pupils very impressed. With regards to the teaching resources, the graphs are particularly useful for looking at the opportunities for gaining access to higher education in Scotland and will be handy for us creating source material for assessments. However, I would like to have seen more about the opportunities for gaining higher education as a comparison between the haves and have nots.&amp;quot; (Andrew Pinder, Modern Studies, Inveralmond Community High School)

&amp;quot;I really enjoyed the very informative youtube showing of the film you made. We have been extremely busy in school exams NABs etc so to be honest I haven't managed to use the resources, but, I have looked through them and I am very impressed. I am absolutely sure that you will have produced an excellent set of teacher resources and I do apologise for this being late to you and not yet having time to use the resources, but I will.&amp;quot; (Eva Georgeson, Modern Studies, Boroughmuir High School)

&amp;quot;Film: Good. Non-controversial - though perhaps would have benefited from showing young people challenging the issues covered? Teaching materials: Activities on the' benefits of going to university' mirror those used I may school with PSE classes input from LEAPS, and so on. Issue of the costs involved to students was important in in many schools is already emphasised by LEAPS and SAAS. Suggested activities are run of the mill and I wonder about the relevance () of many of the topics to pupils within the context of the History/Modern Studies curriculum. However the paper does offer an opportunity to look more closely at research methods.&amp;quot; (Mike McCabe, Modern Studies, George Heriots School)

&amp;quot;Thanks for sending the links and material. Our department have looked at it and I know that Mike has emailed your comments. I found the information very interesting and could see some opportunities for its use in careers or citizenship lesson. Also from an Advanced Higher Modern Studies perspective the research methodologies are interesting. The debate about access to higher education and advantage and deprivation could also be discussed in Higher MS. The adaptability of the resource to these different scenarios is useful. This means that in terms of marketing you could aim to reach PSE and CZ teachers too.&amp;quot; (Neil Seaton, Modern Studies, George Heriots School)

&amp;quot;thank you very much for letting me see the film which I really enjoyed. I am sure the Higher Modern Studies class will be delighted with the finished product! I hope you will be able to call into the school when you are next in Stornoway.&amp;quot; (Frances Murray, Headteacher, The Nicolson Institute)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cb1f0aa7cb2.17895520</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/education/rke/centres-groups/creid/projects/he-in-scotland/he-in-scotland-teaching</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 4: Widening access to higher education - Scotland in UK comparative context, University of Edinburgh, 8 October 2013.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>23F6ED9F-13A1-409A-9C81-A9D414948D06</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This seminar was organised as part of the seminar series on Higher education in Scotland, the devolution settlement and the referendum on independence. It was accompanied by a press release and by a pre-event briefing paper (see separate entry). The seminar focused on issues associated with widening participation and fair access to higher education, and delegates included academics from across Scotland, as well as England and Europe. Policy makers, third sector representatives and journalists also attended; in total, 85 signed up for the event. Seven speakers presented at the event, including Professor Christina Ianelli, Professor Jim Gallacher, Dr Laurence Laselle, Professor Carole Leathwood, Dr Vikki Boliver, Dr Gill Wyness and Dr Dominic Orr. The event generated a lot of questions and lively discussion on the day, particularly in the break out sessions and final panel discussion.

The event garnered a lot of press interest, and the briefing paper was cited in First Minister's Questions by Kezia Dugdale on 8 October, which is outlined in a separate engagement activity entry.

The book &amp;quot;Higher Education in Scotland and the UK: Diverging or Converging Systems&amp;quot; was also launched and some of its findings in relation to widening access to Scottish higher education were also highlighted during the seminar.

The event was chaired by Professor Jim Gallacher. Speakers included Professor Sheila Riddell, Sarah Minty, Lucy Hunter Blackburn, Dr Elisabet Weedon, Dr Laurence Lasselle (University of St Andrews), Professor Viviene Cree, Dr Hazel Christie, Professor Lyn Tett and Professor Cristina Iannelli. The seminar was livestreamed  accompanied by a press release. 

The seminar generated a lot of debate at the event itself, on Twitter (https://twitter.com/hashtag/creidwa) and was covered by the front page (title &amp;quot;Free university tuition 'fails to break social inequalities'&amp;quot;) and the leader letter (title &amp;quot;True test is to help students from poorest backgrounds&amp;quot;) of the Herald Scotland on the 2nd December 2015 . The seminar was also mentioned in the news on Radio Scotland (2nd Dec 2015), and Professor Sheila Riddell was interviewed by TESS and by Peter McMahon of Borders TV. The Times (title &amp;quot;Free university is not helping poor, claim academics&amp;quot;), the Independent (titles &amp;quot;Indequality in Scotland is set in stone by free university tuition&amp;quot; and i from the Independent (title &amp;quot;No university fees 'causes inequalities'&amp;quot;) also picked up similar comments on the 3rd December 2015. Professor Riddell's remarks were followed through and backed by comments from Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservatives' leader. This was covered by The Times (title &amp;quot;Bursaries for students fall by &amp;pound;60m under the SNP&amp;quot;) and the Herald Scotland (title &amp;quot;Bursary support for students falls &amp;pound;40m&amp;quot;) on the 4th December 2015, and News Statesman (title &amp;quot;The worst place for poor students in the UK? Scotland&amp;quot; on the 14th December).

One month later, a story of BBC News &amp;quot;Record number of Scots apply to university&amp;quot; (4th Feb 2016)  noted the data released by UCAS in its report &amp;quot;UK application rates by the January deadline&amp;quot; . The reporter referenced our work on widening access again as being one of the critics questioning whether the free university tuition policy actually helps widen access to university.

The presentation was linked to CREID's work on widening access. The audience was international and the presentation was published on the SRHE website so that it was available to colleagues internationally.

Abstract: 

Alongside consideration of the social dimension of the Bologna Process's development, and an overview of widening participation measures in EU member states drawn from Eurostat and Eurostudent data, Dr Weedon will present findings from research relating to a smaller number of European countries. She will reveal that, despite the harmonising efforts of EU policy in relation to opening up HE to lifelong learners, considerable variation occurs across the continent, where interpretations of 'widening access', and the compositions of target groups, vary from country to country.

There was a lot of discussion in the Q and A session, and colleagues contacted Dr Weedon after the event requesting further information.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54368e5fc89945.61964109</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.srhe.ac.uk/events/pastevents/details/?eid=142</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation by Riddell, S. to BSA Conference (University of Leeds, 24 Apr 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15277CF1-B9ED-4BA3-AD6C-7D3844F142BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof. Sheila Riddell gave a presentation as part of the British Sociological Association Presidential event on the Scottish referendum and the future of the UK and Scotland, alongside University of Edinburgh colleagues Professor Charlie Jeffery and Dr Jan Eichhorn.

&amp;quot;Education is not the same driver of social mobility now as it was 20 or 30 years ago. The massive increase in education availability was not accompanied by sufficient creation of middle class jobs to replace the heavy industry we lost.
Fierce competition for such middle class jobs has led the very situation you think is cause by lack of access to higher education. Family contacts, money, connections and confidence can't be legislated against in the free job market.
I think we need to be honest with our young people that without something extra their degree may be worthless. That does not mean those with determination should not be encouraged. Maybe resources would be better placed by mentoring young people giving them the contacts and connections they could never hope to have at that stage of their lives.&amp;quot;

Two articles from the Guardian (29th April 2014) and an article from Huffington Post (1st May 2014) cited Lucy Hunter Blackburn's working paper for the ESRC Fellowship project. While noting that free tuition and cuts to grants in Scotland mainly benefit more affluent families, the articles also highlighted the benefits of the Welsh unique loan system to lower-income families. Anna Rawden and Abby Young-Powell's article 'Welsh university students get most financial support in UK' (http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140429_Guardian_Welsh-univ-students-get-most-financial-support-in-UK.pdf) was published in The Guardian on the same day (29 April 2014) as Severin Carrell's article, also for The Guardian, 'Free tuition in Scotland benefits wealthiest students the most' (http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140429_Guardian_Free-tuition-in-Scotland-benefits-wealthiest-students-the-most.pdf). The articles include Lucy's comments as well as responses from Education Minister Michael Russell and Kezia Dugdale (MSP). The following day, The Huffington Post UK also ran a similar story, focusing on the generous Welsh funding system, 'Welsh Students Get The Most Financial Support For Tuition Fees In The UK' (1 May 2014, http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20140502_HuffPost_Welsh-Students-Get-the-Most-Financial-Support-for-Tuition-Fees-in-the-UK.pdf)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cbb048d5651.08114206</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Projects/34ii_d_ESRCF_WP3.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 2: Changing inequalities and access to a differentiated higher education system, 14 June 2013.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>580137FB-CEBB-4AE3-890A-45DAB98B90A8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>50 delegates attended the event from a range of backgrounds, including researchers, policy makers and practitioners, as well as journalists. A press release and two briefing papers were also published to coincide with the event. 

The seminar presented findings from a study of changing patterns of application and entry to higher education using UCAS data between 1996 and 2010. The study compared England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland over the first full decade since devolution, and examined trends in cross-border movements. The seminar was chaired by Emeritus Professor Sally Brown, and included presentations from Professor Raffe and Dr Croxford, and a plenary discussion which included Professor Riddell, Mark Ratho of the Scottish Funding Council, and Professor Gareth Rees from WISERD. The seminar provided an opportunity for delegates to discuss the findings and their implications for policy and practice, and generated a lot of questions and discussions during the plenary session.

The seminar and its accompany press release and briefing papers were picked up by both The Herald and The Scotsman which reported findings from the briefing papers and Professor Raffe's comments:

The piece, 'Sheila Riddell: The education glass ceiling', considered access to HE and free tuition. Professor Riddell's comments also made the front page of the print version of the newspaper, which included an article relating to Professor Riddell's presentation with the headline, Tuition fee axe 'still favouring the rich'. Other articles published in The Scotsman on the same day related to Professor Riddell's comments and included: Chris Marshall's piece, Scottish universities remain 'elitist', http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/scottish-universities-remain-elitist-1-2948060 and a Leader article, Research forces need for benefits rethink, http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20130530_ScotsmanCommentary_Leaders_Research-forces-need-for-benefits-rethink.pdf

The op-ed piece sparked a lot of debate in the media, and a number of articles responded to the piece. 

The Scotsman (31 May 2013) included a response from Education Minister Mike Russell to Professor Riddell's piece: http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20130531_Scotsman_Mike-Russell-hits-back-over-fee-scrapping.pdf , while on 1 June it included another response to the piece from Robin Parker, then NUS Scotland President, expressing an alternative view to that of Professor Riddell on widening access: http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20130601_Scotsman_RobinParker_Education-debate-should-be-on-access.pdf

A few days later, The Daily Telegraph, reported comments from an interview with Professor von Prondzynski for Holyrood Magazine. He echoed Professor Riddell's comments on failure of free tuition to promote wider access to HE. The article also refers to Professor Riddell's earlier reported comments (4 June 2013, Free university tuition a middle-class benefit, says SNP's 'hand-picked' principal http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Press/20130604_Telegraph_Free-university-tuition-a-middle-class-benefit.pdf).

It examined issues such as the performance of school children in Scotland in light of international comparisons, inequality in educational outcomes, the potential impact of Curriculum for Excellence, and whether Scotland's system of one year Highers discourages pupils from staying on at school. It also considered the implications of educational inequalities for higher education and the actions universities and colleges can take to promote greater equality in HE participation.

Professor Raffe, Dr Gill Wyness (LSE), Dr Bill Maxwell (Education Scotland) and Professor Gill Gallacher (GCAL) spoke at the event. It was very well attended, with room changes required to fit all of those who wished to attend, and there was some very stimulating discussion of the issues relating to each presentation. In particular, there was a lot of discussion around the lack of evaluation of Curriculum for Excellence.

A press release (see separate engagement activity entry) and Briefing Paper 2 (http://www.docs.hss.ed.ac.uk/education/creid/Projects/34ivc_ESRCF_Seminar_Briefing.pdf) accompanied the event.

Feedback from delegates included:

Strengths

? David Raffe was brilliant. The range of discussion, and the range of participants, indicate the gulf between university research and those who lead and teach in schools. It would be good to include practitioners and strengthen practitioner research and understanding. 
? David Raffe - excellent.
? What was helpful: Having the slides/note pages was very helpful as an audience member.

Analysis of cross-border student flows fed into discussions of the impact of different funding regimes across the UK, including the Welsh Government's Review of Higher Education Funding and Student Finance Arrangements in Wales. Key informant interviews contributed to discussion of the core values of Scottish HE in comparison with other UK systems. Interviews with young people fed in to the production of school pupils in the constitutional debate. Research findings were discussed in a series of knowledge exchange events, featured in newspaper articles and television debates. Our work has also contributed to policy development across the UK, for example, including citation in the Annual Report of the Child Poverty and Social Mobility Commission 2014 . As a member of the review of higher education in Wales, chaired by Professor Sir Ian Diamond, Professor Sheila Riddell provided evidence on cross-border students flows and the influence of fees regimes to widening access. Professor David Raffe provided evidence to UK and Scottish Government higher education policy committees, as well as producing a report on university governance for the Leadership Foundation (see below for further details). Lucy Hunter Blackburn, an associate member of the team, was commissioned to write a rep[ort for the Higher education policy Institute entitled 'Whose to lose? Citizens, institutions and the ownership of higher education funding in a devolved UK' (Published February 2015). Sarah Minty was awarded an ESRC impact accelerator award by the University of Edinburgh to produce a publication aimed at raising students' awareness of issues associated with the financing of higher education. This work was conducted in association with NUS Scotland and the Students Award Agency for Scotland.</gtr:description><gtr:id>384FF266-930D-4CEA-937F-7A867B29D031</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>543bf7e55f9f71.43786827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>(1) Our research analysed the development of higher education policy since devolution, exploring the extent of policy convergence and divergence. This analysis underlined both the strengths and weaknesses of the existing devolution settlement, which allowed each country to pursue distinctive policies, but without placing any limits on the extent of divergence or the knock-on effects of each country's policies on those of its neighbours. The research also analysed the way in which higher education featured in the independence debate, including the way in which it was used to support particular constitutional positions. For example, in the White Paper, the Scottish Government argued that undergraduate fees policy illustrated fundamental social policy differences between England and Scotland, with Scotland adopting a universalist approach to welfare provision, whilst English higher education was increasingly driven by the market and individual student choice. The unionist parties, on the other hand, argued that higher education illustrated the virtues of devolution, so that within the existing constitutional arrangements Scotland was able to maintain a distinctive approach to undergraduate student funding, whilst benefitting from membership of the UK higher education research area.

(2) Interviews with Scottish policy makers suggested that the majority welcomed particular aspects of higher education policy, in particular the approach to undergraduate student funding. However, they questioned its sustainability in the light of ongoing austerity within the public sector, and believed that it was driven by politics rather than fundamental differences in core values. English policy makers were divided, some questioning the sustainability of the English approach to student fees, repayable via income contingent repayment systems, whilst supporting the decision of Scottish policy makers to fund student fees through the block grant. On the other hand, growing differences in territorial social entitlements, exemplified in higher education, were seen as problematic.

(3) Young people in Scotland also supported the policy of enabling Scottish-domiciled students to study without incurring tuition fees, but like the policy makers, questioned its sustainability. Young people in the north of England believed that the policy was unfair, arguing that UK citizens should have equivalent social entitlements irrespective of residence. All of our interviewees believed that major changes in higher education policy across the UK were likely, irrespective of the referendum outcome. 

(4) Analysis of HESA data revealed connections between student fees policy and cross-border student flows, since different policies may incentivise or disincentivise student movement. Overall, there has been a small decline in the number of Scottish students studying in another home country since devolution. By way of contrast, Welsh-domiciled students are more likely to study in another part of the UK, since student fee support provided by the Welsh Government is transportable. Population projections suggest that there will be a decline in the number of young people in Scotland until about 2023. In order to sustain the size of its higher education sector, it will be necessary for Scotland to be able to attract a growing number of young people from the EU, rest of the UK and internationally.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As constitutional change progresses, it will be important to examine patterns of policy convergence and divergence in higher education policy across the UK. In particular, it will be important to analyse the extent to which there is a continuation of the distinctiveness of HE policy across the four countries of the UK. Conversely, the impact of internationalisation and globalisation, as well as the politics of austerity, may produce greater uniformity. The work on cross-border student flows provides an important benchmark against which future changes may be measured.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4CB6D343-988E-43E3-A8F6-C0EDAC573FAF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>543c01cc210286.86103701</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/education/rke/centres-groups/creid/projects/he-in-scotland/he-in-scotland</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Universities Scotland Annual Report Evidence Submission to Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission's 2014 State of the Nation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E073D7F-8165-418D-92B0-5E9ED935586F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CREID produced a literature review, Widening access to higher education: does anyone know what works? for Universities Scotland.

This is further compounded by long lead in times for many projects from initial engagement.

Higher Education Funding

To ask the First Minister what the Scottish Government's response is to the opinions expressed in the briefing paper, &amp;quot;The funding of higher education in Scotland, the UK and internationally&amp;quot;. (S4F-01414)
The First Minister (Alex Salmond): &amp;quot;We welcome contributions to the debate. In that light, I am sure that Ms Smith will have noticed this morning's contribution from Universities Scotland. Universities Scotland has published legal advice from solicitors Anderson Strathern on university fees post-independence, which explains why, under European Union law, it could be permissible to continue to charge students from the rest of the United Kingdom tuition fees. That shows that a real debate is going on in Scotland. This Government has delivered free education in the face of the naysayers who said that it could not be done. We are confident that we will continue to deliver free education in an independent Scotland.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>543e4c6622e5d4.47631846</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHAGayeZsxw&amp;index=46&amp;list=PL4l0q4AbG0mnVsKDGswgL2CUUNzzMlNCT</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation of Riddell et al.

Sarah presented some key findings from the work with young people and showed the Our Future film produced as part of the project to 20 researchers who attended the seminar. Much of the discussion focused on methodological issues, and attendees said that it had prompted them to consider new ways of conducting and disseminating research. 

Graeme Beale, Principal Research Officer of the Scottish Government contacted Sarah after the seminar with feedback, and requesting to show the film as a resource on the Away Day for Scottish Government researchers. It was felt that this would encourage researchers to consider alternative methods of collecting and disseminating research findings to new audiences.

'90. Emerging evidence suggests that the poorest graduates leave university with more debt than more advantaged graduates. From 2013/14 maintenance grants have been reduced and student loans increased, resulting in the highest student debt for those from the lowest income backgrounds. (ref 102) Grants for the poorest students (those from families earning less than &amp;pound;16,000 per year) have been reduced by about one-third from &amp;pound;2,650 in 2012/13 to &amp;pound;1,750 in 2014/15. Grants for mature students have historically been lower and these have reduced from &amp;pound;1,000 in 2012/2013 to &amp;pound;750 in 2014/15. Calculations show that the poorest young people will have to borrow &amp;pound;23,000. Scottish students do not necessarily graduate with less debt than all other parts of the UK. Recent research states that &amp;quot;even in the absence of tuition fees, levels of final debt for low-income Scottish students who study in Scotland are comparable with and, in certain cases, higher than debt levels for similar students from the other devolved administrations&amp;quot;.
