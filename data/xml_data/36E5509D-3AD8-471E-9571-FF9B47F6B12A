Since 1845 when her sister Cassandra died, they have been scattered, first among family members, and subsequently in libraries, museums, and private collections around the world. A digital edition, created with the generous support of the AHRC Resource Enhancement Scheme, has made accessible a new resource for this major writer: images of every page of the manuscript fiction and fully searchable transcriptions of their contents. The real public benefit of the digital edition is that Austen's fiction manuscripts are now freely available online for anyone worldwide wishing to consult or enjoy them. \nThe digital edition was the first part of a more ambitious project that aims to incorporate alongside full facsimile images and transcriptions (derived from the digital edition) a close-grained study of Austen's working practices. This new research will culminate in a four-volume print edition of Jane Austen's Fiction Manuscripts, to be published by Oxford University Press. New elements will be: an introduction tracing the genesis of the individual manuscript writings, their relationship to Austen's print career, their publication history and critical reception; short essays on features of the manuscripts ('Composition and Revision'; 'Writing Habits'; 'Jane Austen's Gatherings'; 'Jane Austen's Reading'; 'Punctuation'; 'The Dynamics of the Manuscript Page'; 'Hands other than Jane Austen's'); full textual critical apparatus and textual annotations for each manuscript. In total, around 50,000 words of new material will be added to the images and transcriptions. I will further consolidate the relationship between digital and print forms of the edition in two essays on their conceptual and practical relationship, to be published in scholarly journals. \nThough previous studies exist (notably Brian Southam's pioneering Jane Austen's Literary Manuscripts (1964; revised edition, 2001)), systematic examination has been hampered by the relative inaccessibility of the manuscripts themselves and by repeated inconsistencies in editorial practices in dealing with them. Now that we have high quality images with consistently and deeply encoded diplomatic transcriptions, it is possible to develop the first fully comparative scholarly analysis of the compositional features of the manuscript fiction, to create a comprehensive textual critical apparatus, and to map Austen's working methods as a writer: the creative development of individual works, and the comparative understanding of her practices across her career. This new research will be presented in the print edition. Taken together, the distinct digital and print components will create a powerful hybrid edition: part textual laboratory and part authoritative, stable reference source. \nIt is already clear that for Austen there was a vital link between composition surface and the act of writing. Further research for the print edition will substantiate a definition of manuscript editing as the editing of an object (shop-bought notebook or homemade paper gathering) as well as its written text. It will address such questions as: how might we incorporate the formal features of manuscript (information from paper, its quality, shape and size, from ink, and the disposition of words on the page) into our understanding of the meaning of texts? what are the differences between an author's appearance in manuscript and in print, and how might manuscript evidence, as a collection of events and surfaces (objects that encode time as well as space), adjust our understanding of authorial practice?\nI will draw on the visual and searchable evidence within the digital edition for much of this work. Further research will be undertaken on primary Austen materials held in the Morgan Library &amp;amp; Museum, New York, in King's College, Cambridge, and in the British Library, London.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As long ago as 1927, the Shakespeare scholar Caroline Spurgeon made the extraordinary claim that 'every scrap of information and every ray of light on Jane Austen are of national importance.' If anything, this is even truer in 2010.\n\nJane Austen's manuscripts offer a radically changed portrait of a writer we all thought we knew. They represent writings other than the famous six novels and all were unpublished in her lifetime. In manuscripts we see something different from the printed book: the writer at work, struggling to capture an idea or bring a character to life; we see blots, crossings out, messiness; we see creation as it happens. Because they look different and are laid out differently (Jane Austen, for example, wrote in a continuous stream without paragraphing), manuscript writings have the potential to transform our point of view on what we thought we knew. The manuscripts of a much loved author can render her writing at the same time unfamiliar and more intimate. For these reasons, they have the power to fascinate scholars and general public alike. For Austen we have manuscript fiction spanning almost her whole life: from the childish hand of a twelve-year old to the novel she put aside unfinished only months before she died, aged forty-one. \n\nMy current research, a four-volume print edition of the manuscript fiction to be published by Oxford University Press, is the second component in an innovative hybrid project that will act as record and witness to the state of Austen manuscript scholarship at a particular cultural moment. It will contain full facsimile images of each manuscript, transcriptions, descriptions of their appearance, a complete textual apparatus describing revisions in minute detail, and a series of short essays: on her habits of composition, on her spelling and punctuation, on her method of making homemade gatherings). Its contents will be variously transformed and recycled by me and by others over a considerable period.\n \nJane Austen's manuscripts and her habits of writing already engage interest across a wide spectrum of general and amateur readers, as confirmed by the numerous invitations I receive to demonstrate and discuss their implications: from Oxford University alumni meetings, to Sixth Formers, to members of the Jane Austen Society. In Spring 2010, in my role as Patron of Jane Austen's House Museum, I chaired the panel of judges of a competition to encourage school children of all ages (9-18) to attempt a short piece of fiction on the topic 'beginning a story'. In June 2010 I joined the British Library Education Department and actors from recent Austen screen productions in a national event, a day school, 'Jane Austen in Performance', for Sixth Formers. More recently, I filmed a short commentary on how to use the AHRC-funded Austen digital edition to accompany its inclusion in the British Library's public exhibition 'Growing Knowledge: The Evolution of Research' running from 12 October 2010 to 16 July 2011. \n\nIn quite another area, I collaborate closely with museums, archivists, and conservators, with whom I have common concerns for accurate manuscript cataloguing and description and for protecting the status of manuscripts as unique material documents. In the case of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and the Morgan Library, New York, my work has led to specific new conservation initiatives: funds from the National Manuscript Conservation Trust to repair the original binding of the Bodleian Austen manuscript, Volume the First; the Morgan Library's recent disbinding of its manuscript, Lady Susan, from its late Victorian casing to reveal its original structure. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54543</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The print edition (the major outcome of the grant) is in production with Oxford University Press and due for publication in Autumn 2017.
