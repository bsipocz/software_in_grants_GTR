Studies of crime as a public issue and of crime policy formation have not yet fully addressed the realities of living in a multi-tiered democracy.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How differently has policy developed in Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in recent years in light of the very distinct powers and political trajectories of the places concerned? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What can be learned for Northern Ireland, where key areas of criminal justice have only recently been devolved, from these accounts? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What can we learn anew about England by viewing it from other vantage points?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>We will hold four one-day seminars in Cardiff, Oxford, Belfast and Edinburgh. As well as discussing history, politics and culture in criminal justice before and since devolution they will focus on key current developments in policing and in offender management, desistance and resettlement. Questions about the relationships between knowledge and policy, and about how these are configured in various sites of decision-making are a central cross-cutting theme.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>All aspects of the seminars will be collaborative, from inception to dissemination. We construe policy-makers, practitioners and members of civil society groups not simply as 'audiences' for these events but as partners in their co-production. For example, non-academic participants in the seminars will be involved as presenters on each occasion. This will have the direct benefit of building alliances, or in many case strengthening relationships that already exist, across sectors. More than this, however, the seminars will contribute to facilitating relationships, with the longer-term goal of establishing formally constituted networks, between policy and research communities across the constituent countries of the UK. 

Richard Sparks (PI) and Mike Maguire (Co-I) are Directors respectively of the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research (www.sccjr.ac.uk) and of the Welsh Centre for Crime and Social Justice (www.wccsj.ac.uk). These are both multi-institutional research centres with significant knowledge exchange capacities, and whose remits include promoting dialogue and informing policy in Scotland and Wales through research. Shadd Maruna (Co-I) is Director of the Institute for Criminology and Criminal Justice at Queen's University. Ian Loader is Director of the Centre for Criminology at the University of Oxford. All these organizations maintain well-visited websites and extensive mailing lists (SCCJR mailings are distributed to approximately 1000 individuals and organizations, for example) and publicize their research through social media, as well as through all the channels available to their partner institutions. This means that we can be certain that outputs from the seminars will be made available to policy and practice communities, and to other interested publics across the UK and internationally. 

A principal focus of these seminars is the nexus between research and policy. We aim to promote discussion on the institutional arrangements in and through which research is conducted, the channels through which research informs policy, the conditions under which research is utilized and the creation of sustainable relationships between research and policy communities within and across the four countries. Comparative discussion of these questions can help to clarify which arrangements, channels, conditions and relationships best meet the needs of the parties concerned and to dialogue on what researchers and policy-makers can properly expect from one another. 

We will circulate accessible briefings on the outcome of each seminar widely and promptly. The audiences for these will include: Governmental policy makers; parliamentarians/assembly members; practitioners; lobbying organisations (for example Howard League Scotland); third sector service providers (for example Apex, SACRO, NIACRO, Children First, Victim Support), opinion formers, selected members of the press. The anticipated impacts of these actions include: 

- Increased awareness of and access to the research evidence about criminal justice policies and mechanics of policy making
- Improved understanding about why and how policies are made in devolved territories
- Raised profile about different criminal justice policy responses, highlighting different policy ideas and presenting devolved administrations as potential comparators/partners in international networks
 
The seminars wil lead tol: 

- Improved dialogue between those involved in policy-making from different perspectives and focused on different issues
- Stronger relationships and links between academic, policy and practitioner communities
- Improved understanding about policy making, and the links between policy, practice and research in the criminal justice field
- Learning from experience in other UK jurisdictions based on insights into the similarities and differences in policy, policy making processes and environments and examples of innovative practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14943</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar Series: Five presentations across the country on 'Crime Control and Devolution: Policy-Making and Expert Knowledge in a Multi-Tiered Democracy'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4FDD0D39-4314-4928-99F2-9F4ACE62CAA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Questions and discussion.

One theme of such debates is that of differentiating developments in Scotland form those in England and Wales and associating the former with what are understood to be progressive practices characteristic of Scandinavian social democracies. 

In February 2014 Richard Sparks, Fergus McNeill and colleagues (Kirsten Anderson, Fergus McNeill, Marguerite Scihnkel and Richard Sparks) submitted a report to the Scottish Prison Service on 'Developing a Professional Qualification for Scottish Prison Service Staff? In July 2014 we received a letter of the Director of Corporate HR at SPS advising us that this document would form the basis of future strategic development in this area. Since then our co-worker Kirstin Anderson has been located at the Scottish Prison Service College developing training strategy and packages. We continue to be very actively involved with senior decision-makers in SPS in a range of strategic areas, including latterly the rethinking of the approach to the imprisonment of women in Scotland and the redevelopment of the women's estate.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2A6725EF-A163-43A2-832A-8C5F240944DD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54ef4f0d078708.75790665</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The seminars clearly demonstrated the very different circumstances, powers and prospects of crime and criminal justice and their associated agencies and institutions in each of the UK polities. The divergences, however, in no way cancel the very extensive shared histories and common vocabularies across the four sites; nor should they distract attention from the continuing flow of discourses, practices and expert knowledges between them. For both reasons the UK is in certain respects a more exciting venue for a comparative sociology of policy than some of the cross-national comparators that are more conventionally pursued.

Viewed positively, devolved institutions can be the heralds of democratic responsiveness in respect of crime control. They can provide instances of striking innovation, and in aligning more successfully with the priorities and values of their constituencies, avoid some of the legitimation deficits that sometimes afflict similar institutions at the nation-state level. Conversely, they can be sites of local populism and hostages to vested interests and contests over resources. It is sometimes alleged that the transfer of authority over questions of crime and punishment to devolved authorities can result in a paradoxical centralism and in the politicization of practices that formerly escaped the direct heat of competition and publicity. This has produced a degree of volatility in policy over the period since devolution, especially in Scotland. There are a variety of current topics - such as divergences in the governance of policing in Scotland and England and Wales; the increasingly different mixes of public and private sector management of community justice services; and differentiation between governing philosophies in the management of prisons across the UK - that now demand detailed empirical attention.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Examples of ongoing knowledge exchange and influencing activities that have been advanced and facilitated by relationships developed during the seminars include Richard Sparks's work on performance management in community justice with Lothian and Borders Community Justice Authority (whose Chief Executive Robert Strachan was one of our speakers), and the Authority's decision to provide resources to support networking activities between doctoral students and practitioner communities in the region; Dominic Kelly and Shadd Maruna's new study of change management in the Northern Ireland Prison Service; Richard Sparks and Fergus McNeill's contributions to the development of professional qualifications for prison staff in Scotland; and Nick Fyfe and Alistair Henry's work on comparative police reform in Scotland and elsewhere in Europe.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>96C5378E-22DA-4C4D-AC50-388586239F46</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54634b9e232f74.22884287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J021679/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2ABF7A73-38A2-4394-B71D-0AAF27E24D79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminal Law &amp; Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
