This project seeks to take advantage of this, through developing novel and appropriate advanced statistical techniques which are required to analyse such data. The methods will then be applied to answer clinically relevant questions in the areas of cardiovascular disease and cancer research, with the potential to have substantial impact in both areas, and more widely across a diverse range of clinical areas.

The first project aims to decompose the pathways of cardiovascular disease to increase the understanding of which risk factors are associated with different outcomes, using data from linked electronic health records in the UK. For example, a patient begins healthy, then experiences a first heart attack, and then a subsequent stroke. By fitting models to each of these transitions from state to state, we can identify important risk factors which could be used to identify patients at an increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. By modelling the whole profile of a patient, we make most efficient use of the available data, and will also be able to develop predictions for future events, tailored to individual patients. This aspect is crucially important in communicating information to patients, and ensuring such information is both understandable and meaningful.

The second substantive project will further develop and apply joint models of longitudinal and survival data, which allow the modelling of a biomarker, measured with error and repeatedly over time, such as blood pressure, and how changes in the biomarker are related to the rate of an event of interest, such as death. We will investigate the relationship between changes in haemoglobin levels over time, and the rate of cancer diagnoses, using Swedish and Danish registry data. This may lead to identifying important trajectories of haemoglobin which can allow targeted monitoring, or indeed interventions to be applied sooner, or cases be diagnosed earlier. Methodology will be developed to allow these computationally intensive methods to be applied to such a large database, providing a widely applicable methodological framework.

The third project will investigate how changes in blood pressure over time are associated with the risk of experiencing cardiovascular events, such as a heart attack or stroke. We have available a vast resource of data from electronic health records, collected at GP practices across the country. Such data exhibits a hierarchical structure, with biomarker repeated measures nested within patients, nested within GP practice. It is important to account for this hierarchical structure in our analyses. This project will extend joint longitudinal-survival models to enable us to account for such structures, which will enable us to investigate factors such as deprivation status measured at the practice level.

Alongside the above projects, we believe it is crucial to simultaneously develop freely available user friendly software which implements the methodology, subsequently release it to the research community and run courses aimed to help transfer methods into practice. This is particularly important as the increased availability of large datasets means methods must be able to handle 'big data' efficiently, which requires advanced programming skills.

To conclude, in this project we aim to utilise the methods in the areas of both cardiovascular and cancer epidemiology; however, through releasing software, it means that the methodological work can be applied to any number of different disease areas, to help answer a variety of relevant and clinically important questions, across the range of health research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The first project will develop parametric multi-state models, combining various families of standard parametric models, with more flexible approaches using splines, estimated jointly, allowing a general framework where each state can be modelled using different or the same family of models, greatly extending existing approaches. There will be a concerted effort to provide easily interpretable predictions and summaries of the impact of risk factors on outcomes, such as differences and ratios of transition probabilities or length of stay, across changing covariate patterns. Multi-state profiles occur commonly in areas such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and infection, and therefore this project has the potential to impact widely across the health domain. The framework will be extended to a semi-Markov setting, to account for the likely association between previous and future events, an assumption which is often ignored. The second area will be to extend joint longitudinal-survival models. Firstly, we will incorporate sampling weights into the joint likelihood, in a case-cohort approach, both at the observation and patient-level, which will enable their use in large epidemiological datasets. Secondly, they will be extended to allow a general level model, using adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature to calculate the M-level likelihood, and also derive analytic derivatives for extensive computational benefits. Such data occurs widely, such as biomarkers nested within patients, nested within GP practice. This project is centred on addressing substantial limitations in key methodological areas, within the field of survival analysis, to provide accessible models which can be used in a diverse range of clinical research. Each development will be directly utilised to answer important clinical questions in heart disease and cancer research. Finally, user-friendly software will be provided, complimented by training courses to provide platforms for their use in medical research.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is a wide variety of groups that will benefit from the proposed research included in this grant application, particularly as the research plan is targeted to be a combination of complimentary methodological and applied projects, with substantial outputs envisaged in both research domains. Particular groups who will directly benefit include; patients, populations, researchers, and health care decision makers.

In each of the projects, there is great potential to impact patients, through more in-depth understanding of disease profiles offered by the developing model frameworks, by identifying clinically important associations between risk factors and outcomes. The projects involve identifying key risk factors, whose impact may differ and change along the disease pathway, allowing the identification of patients at increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes, or cancer diagnosis, respectively. Specifically in project 2a, we aim to identify patterns in how haemoglobin levels change over time, and whether changes can be identified which are indicative of an impending cancer diagnosis. The projects also have potential impact at the population level, and will be able to provide useful information to healthcare decision makers for resource planning and allocation by modelling disease trajectories over time. 

Prediction is a fundamental aspect of this proposal, namely; making better use of the extended availability of electronic health records, to gain greater understanding of disease profiles, and to subsequently improve both monitoring of and future care of patients. This brings focus to more precision medicine, allowing treatments to be targeted, thus maximising health gain whilst minimising adverse events.

There is potential to impact the wider NHS in terms of costs and health policy decision makers. Many cancer drugs submitted through NICE now have some form of assessment of their effect in the short term through the use of biomarker monitoring. Furthermore, multi-state models are used extensively in economic decision modelling, especially when needing to extrapolate to a lifetime time horizon, and therefore the methods developed in this project will further aid health policy decision making for the NHS.

The methodological components will have particularly wide ranging implications, as they will be directly transferable to a variety of health research areas. Project 1 concentrates on multi-state models, which are needed in cardiovascular disease to appropriately model the disease profile as a patient moves from healthy to diseased states. This is also true of cancer, where cancer recurrence for example, can be modelled as a multi-state model, and we can investigate the impact of treatment and how it changes between recurrences. Repeated hospitalisations is also another area of use, in critical care, where we can model risk factors and how they impact time to discharge given previous events. The joint model developments described in projects 2a and 2b are also highly transferrable, as repeatedly measured outcomes occur commonly across the breadth of clinical research, such as blood pressure in CVD, prostate specific antigen in prostate cancer, prothrombin index in liver cirrhosis, to name a few. This is particularly pertinent in electronic health records, as the sources of and diversity of covariate information continues to grow. The developments of this grant will have substantial impact on other researchers, as they will directly benefit from using methods that get more out of the data.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>333864</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>47A71AC5-7745-4D82-AE01-CADEFE80C911</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parametric multistate survival models: Flexible modelling allowing transition-specific distributions with application to estimating clinically useful measures of effect differences.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Statistics in medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2057c985c76e13f0f2f14ab5e43ad32f"><gtr:id>2057c985c76e13f0f2f14ab5e43ad32f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crowther MJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0277-6715</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa9958aee5701.94795880</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BABD5C84-7DEC-4AFB-827B-D84BF9FA51C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Extended multivariate generalised linear and non-linear mixed effects models</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ArXiv e-prints</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfb63e6973029f2fb00ee917d32c2803"><gtr:id>cfb63e6973029f2fb00ee917d32c2803</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crowther Michael J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa9999d7b18b6.75905305</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P015433/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>FB395309-E202-4FE8-87B0-041A3D72D4D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.5  Research design and methodologies (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>90487A08-C473-4CEB-B6D9-011A74AD06CF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.4  Research design and methodologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
