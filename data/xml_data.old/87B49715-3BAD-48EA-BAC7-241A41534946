This project explores the feasibility of using marine fouling biofilm mechanical and physical properties as predictors of associated drag, and thus more sophisticated metrics of coating performance than the current standard of percent coverage. Biofouling and coatings experts at International Paint, Ltd and biofilm mechanics experts at University of Southampton will partner to develop and validate two innovate methods and apparatuses for measurement of biofilm drag and mechanical/physical properties on intact, immersed biofilms on marine coatings. With these methods, the teams will compile the first dataset of biofilm drag penalties with respect to the mechanical/physical properties of these compliant materials. The test methods and broader knowledge of biofilm properties and drag will directly benefit coatings research and development, product performance modelling, and fundamental materials science.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>See main Innovate UK application</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47566</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Strathclyde</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hydrodynamic considerations of marine fouling</gtr:description><gtr:id>92CFFCA2-3906-4EB6-A4E3-823B86EE7760</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have submitted a paper to the peer journal &amp;quot;Biofouling&amp;quot;.

Development of a method to accelerate screen marine coatings using spinning disk rheometry will significantly reduce the bottleneck between the design and fabrication of novel anti-biofouling coatings at the bench and in field testing.

We have designed, fabricated and tested a marine biofilm flow cell for in situ determination of drag, structure and viscoelastic properties. The flow cell has been designed for field operation at harbor or onboard a vessel. (870 mm length (L), 10 mm height (H) and 50 mm width (W)) which was constructed by sandwiching together four panels. The bottom and the top panels, made of Perspex, and can be sprayed with corrosion resistant or antifouling marine coatings. Alternatively panmels can be exposed to sea water on hang boards or by mounting to ship hulls then assembled into the flow cell. The bottom panel had machined recesses to insert six Perspex discs (D=40 mm) for rheometer analysis. The side panels are made of clear acrylic to allow natural light to enter from either side. A digital flowmeter (PRS Corrente, AQUAfair) monitored flow rate and the water temperature. The pressure drop (?P) is measured using a differential pressure sensor (PL-692, Omni Instruments). A submersible pump (Aqua Medic DC Runner 9.1) is used to continuously pump fresh sea water through the flow cell. The loss coefficient (k) where was found by measuring the ?P at various flow velocities (u) over the entire pump range (currently 0-4 knots but we plan to extend this range with a m ore powerful pump. The flow cell has been operated continuously at 25 L/min (1.6 knots) for 48 days at the National Oceanography Centre Southampton (NOCS) and monitored during biofilm growth. We have calibrated the system with sandpaper to provide defined roughness and the system behaves as predicted. We have also found that fouling considerably and significantly increases drag. The system is designed so that a window can be installed to non-destructively image changes to the structure and detachment of marine fouling as the speed increases. These experiments will be performed at the end of March.

The system can control and measure flow velocity of sea water and simultaneously record temperture and pressure drop from which we can calculate marine drag. The flow cell can be fitted with coupons coated with 

Knowledge transfer within industry partner - engagement activities and review activities have highlighted potential use of OCT to measure other mesoscale features as required by coating scientists, and at least 3 investigative projects within the company have followed our internal presentations.

The system has been designed to continuously monitor pressure drop and temperature, which can be used to calculate drag. The systems has been designed to incorporate panels which have been immersed in seawater on ship hulls or immersion boards from pontoons. The system incorporates rheometer disks so we can relate data generated from the flow cell with our novel rapid screening rheometer system (described in a separate research tool entry). The side panels were made of clear acrylic to allow natural light to enter from either side. The system can be fitted with a clear window to observe how the viscoealstic biofouling responds to changes in flow velocity and the effect on drag as well as monitor for detachment ans shedding of biofouling. Currently the system can operate up to approximately 4 knots but this is planned to increase with the addition of a more powerful pump.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FE9A6AB7-745F-4C87-AA9B-E77E5FC8098D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This system will be used by the partner company in their R&amp;amp;D programme to develop more efficient anti-drag and anti-fouling technologies for use in the marine industry.

Temperature control was identified as a parameter requiring closer control in future during measurements. Discs were fouled by immersion in the sea at Southampton docks for 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks before drag measurements were made. After the first 2 week exposure period steps were taken to prevent grazing of the disc surfaces by fish. The amount of slime fouling on individual discs varied, and the drag measurements reflected this. Nevertheless statistically significant differences in drag were observed between the different exposure durations. Calibration was carried out using varying grades of sandpaper roughness applied to test discs. A linear relationship between measured surface roughness and the disc coefficient of momentum (torque coefficient) was observed. The method is considered to be reliable and reproducible enough to use in routine testing of marine coatings.</gtr:description><gtr:id>96312035-AC0A-472F-ADCF-6A884132F513</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The work is currently being written up for a paper to be submitted to ocean Engineering and a presentation at Advanced Model Measurement Technology for The Maritime Industry (AMT'17) will be hosted in Strathclyde University of Glasgow in 11-13 October 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c939f8f04cb7.36028276</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Development of a rheometer method for rapid screening of marine coatings and influence of bofouling on ship hull drag</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P004164/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BA89E2C-27FE-4553-819B-3CE27FC71EC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
