Since 2004 there has been a system of ?independent reviewing officers? (IROs) to monitor the way that local authorities implement the plans, and to ensure that the child?s wishes and feelings are fully considered. In April 2011, new government regulations and guidance came into force, which (amongst other things) strengthened the IRO?s role.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>investigate how the new care planning regulations and guidance are being implemented;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>investigate the effectiveness of IROs for monitoring plans, promoting children's well-being, and managing their participation;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>examine overlaps and differences in the roles and responsibilities of the various individuals involved, and how disagreements are managed;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>ascertain the views of children and parents about the care planning and review process, particularly the role of the IRO.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The research will focus on four local authorities in England. It will involve a study of case files of 120 children, plus interviews with a sub-sample of social workers, IROs, parents and young people. There will also be a national survey of IROs and social work managers.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
The most important beneficiaries of the research will be children and young people in care and on the edge of care. The ultimate goal is to help policy makers, managers and practitioners improve the effectiveness of services for children for whom the state is the 'corporate parent'. Therefore further beneficiaries, alongside the children, will be birth parents and other family members; foster carers; a wide range of child and family welfare practitioners including IROs, social workers and local authority managers; Cafcass children's guardians; lawyers and judges; and government policy makers.
How will they benefit? 
This research will provide new information, as well as building on and extending other recent research, to improve our understanding and operation of systems for care planning and reviewing. For the first time, there will be a detailed picture nationally and in different local areas of the operation of care planning and the role of the IRO, which will provide feedback on the new regulations and guidance, while also offering practical suggestions for improvement where this is necessary. Findings will be communicated through a range of media including a dedicated website; professional journals and conferences; the National Association of Independent Reviewing Officers (NAIRO), British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, Cafcass and our networks within Making Research Count and the Centre for Research on the Child and Family (see Pathways to Impact for details).
 The child is the most significant beneficiary. Because care planning involves deciding where a looked after child will live and with whom, the quality of the decision making and the child's experience of their role in the process will profoundly affect each child's current and future well-being. This is why the project focuses not only on pathways, placements and professional perceptions, but also on the child's experience of being treated with concern and respect for their need to feel effective and be involved in decisions. 
 For others close to the child, such as birth parents, foster carers, kinship carers and adoptive parents, the quality of the decisions made and the support provided will also be life changing. The research will give professionals information about the best ways of responding sensitively to their varied needs and roles in care planning, whilst keeping a focus on the best interests of the child. 
 The range of professionals involved directly in the reviewing process, including the case responsible social worker, IRO, others such as teacher or health visitor, will all benefit from a deeper understanding that clarifies professional roles, and shares strategies for dealing constructively with uncertainty and disagreements. Senior managers will appreciate clearer knowledge about the effectiveness of the planning and review system, and the role of the IRO, in order to assist in service planning. 
 Professionals in the family justice system (lawyers, judges and children's guardians) will benefit from greater awareness and a firmer evidence base than exists at present of the operation of the planning and review system, and the role of the IRO. The family justice system is bedevilled by mistrust and duplication of work, causing great expense and delay (FJR, 2011). Breaking this cycle will require bold action and greater trust between the different agencies and professionals, based on better understanding 
 Policy makers in central government will also benefit from greater knowledge of the effectiveness of the new regulations and guidance, especially regarding the independence of the IRO, and how corporate parenting decisions are made in the context of interagency responsibility for children. The Department for Education takes responsibility for the IRO service, and we shall engage with them in particular to ensure that our findings shape on-going policy and practice</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>306183</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Annual conference of Association of Lawyers for Children</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AD5DB6B-9B05-4B0E-A3FA-3319811C553F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked lively and well-informed discussion, useful information was shared and debated.

A research briefing was produced for the launch conference in October 2014 and has been available online since then, along with the PowerPoint presentations from the conference. The full research report, peer reviewed, was published on the UEA CRCF website (Centre for Research on Children and Families) in October 2015. The briefing and the full report have both been circulated widely, to central and local government policy makers, local authority managers, IRO managers and practitioners, social workers and lawyers, as well as to academics. 

Key presentations for policy and academic impact have been to the National Association of Independent Reviewing Officers, NAIRO (Oct 2014); the Association of Lawyers for Children, ALC (Nov 2014); the National Association of Guardians ad litem and Reporting Officers, NAGALRO (March 2015); participation in an experts' panel at the 2015 NAIRO conference; to IROs in Birmingham and London, 2016; papers at the EUSARF conferences in 2014 and 2016 (European Scientific Association for Residential and Foster Care) and the Social Work Research Association (2016). A paper was published in the international journal Child and Youth Services Review in 2016. 

IROs have been criticised for not being sufficiently independent and challenging of local authorities, but the core message of the research is that overall the IRO service can and does make important and effective contributions to the well-being of looked after children. There may be shortcomings in some cases, but the study also found many examples of effective, and sometimes forceful, intervention. But the effectiveness of the service needs to be seen in the context of local authority resources and decision-making structures, the services provided (or not) by other agencies, the role of the courts, and the difficulties faced by the children and their families; and also, importantly, the ambiguities and subtleties of the IROs' role and why it has evolved the way it has. Many of the challenges facing the care system are to do with shortage of resources, in local authorities and other agencies. In this context, challenge on its own may not be enough to move things forward. So the role of the IRO has developed to combine scrutiny with more collaborative ways of working (and the government guidance expects them to try informal approaches first). The contribution is more often through discussion and negotiation, and even at times direct intervention; it goes beyond the formal requirements of the statutory guidance and is much more nuanced and complex in practice. Measuring the effectiveness of IRO service by the number of formal challenges misses the significant collaborative contribution that they make. 

Three key policy issues for IROs have been prominent since 2014. The first concerns IROs' role in care proceedings, especially in the light of the policy drive to reduce the duration of care cases to 26 weeks; and in particular, their working relationships with children's guardians (formerly 'guardians ad litem': social workers who provide independent reports to the court, employed by an organisation known as 'Cafcass'). The study found that children's guardians had the most sceptical views about the effectiveness of IROs, compared to the other professional groups, parents and young people participating in the research. However, it also found examples of good inter-professional relationships and effective joint working to resolve problems and make better plans for children. Relationships between the two groups were undermined by preconceptions and misunderstandings. New guidelines for IROs and children's guardians to work together in care cases were published in January 2015 by Cafcass and the ADCS (Association of Directors of Children's Services). The presentations at the ALC conference in November 2014 and the NAGALRO conference in March 2015 were important opportunities to convey the research messages to lawyers and children's guardians, offering new understandings and challenging some of the preconceptions. According to the organisers of the ALC conference, the presentation there was 'very well received'. The President of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, chaired the NAGALRO event. A subsequent paper in the NAGALRO professional journal, Seen and Heard, spread the messages further. We also sent a draft of the full report to the Chief Executive of Cafcass, who commented that it was 'Great work faultless and unarguable'. 

The second issue concerns the organisational location of the IRO service, whether it should be part of local authorities or move to a separate organisation. This was particularly prominent in 2014-15 because the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 gave the Secretary of State for Education the power to issue regulations to establish an independent IRO organisation, but this power was time-limited and expired in November 2015. There are some IROs, and others, who consider that a move to an independent organisation would be beneficial; others consider there is still sufficient room for improvement within the current organisational arrangements; and some are strongly opposed to such a change. Our research identified numerous advantages to remaining within local authorities, and we concluded that the interactive contribution of IROs would be jeopardised by separation. Some of the leading members of NAIRO have been in favour of the IRO service being removed from local authorities. Indeed, at the 2014 annual conference where we presented a summary of our research, a member of the Association's committee spoke in favour of separation, and initiated an online discussion and vote amongst the membership. The result was announced in June 2015, and was an overwhelming vote against separation. One of the national patrons of NAIRO told us that our presentation and research briefing 'had a big impact on pushing the NAIRO position to remaining within LAs'. 

The third aspect concerns the on-going questions about the effectiveness of the IRO service and reforms to children's services more generally. These became prominent in 2016-17, in the debates about the Children and Social Work Bill. One of the provisions in the bill created the 'freedom' for selected local authorities to be granted exemptions from certain statutory obligations by the secretary of state for up to six years, to trial new ways of working. Some of the statutory requirements that were at stake concerned the role of the IRO. There were strong protests from some groups against these proposals for undermining children's rights and protections, although support from others. We gave a copy of our report to the Earl of Listowel, one of the NAIRO patrons, who spoke against the proposals in the House of Lords. The chair of the NAIRO trustees asked us for advice on arguing against the changes, which we gave, and she told us that the evidence in the research report was 'just what we need'. Other key social work figures, including Professor Eileen Munro, later declared their opposition to the proposals, and in March 2017 the government announced that it would withdraw them.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F6C49FB1-DBF6-4A35-BD59-4277C9B8E4BF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5633671ce45107.41565686</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Effective care planning and review are considered essential for the well-being of children in care. The role of 'independent reviewing officer' (IRO) was created in 2004 to monitor children's care plans, chair review meetings and ensure that children's wishes and feelings are fully considered. IROs are employees of the local authority, but independent of the line management of cases. On-going questions about the quality of care planning and effectiveness of IROs led to new regulations and guidance in 2011. This study investigated how care plans are made, implemented, reviewed, and if necessary changed. We gained a comprehensive picture through a case file survey (122 cases), in-depth interviews (54 social workers, 54 IROs, 15 parents and 15 young people), focus groups (four multi-professional groups and two with young people) and nationally-distributed questionnaires for IROs (65), social work team managers (46) and children's guardians (39). 
1. Care planning: Care plans have to address the long-term goal for the child and the day-to-day arrangements for his/her welfare. Our study gives a detailed picture of the realities and complexities that lie beneath formal regulations and policy guidance. Some of the children and young people have very great needs, and circumstances can change quickly and unpredictably. Contact with parents or siblings is often problematic. Further, child care reviews are only one part of a complex, multi-layered and multi-agency system. Many of the 'decisions' of reviews depend on decisions made elsewhere in the local authority, other agencies or the courts, and on having the resources to implement them.
2. Involving children and parents: Our study shows the challenges and dilemmas of involving children, young people and their parents, in the review process. Heavy workloads and staff turnover often make it hard for social workers and IROs alike to know the children well. Key challenges are to promote children's participation but also protect their privacy or feelings, and ensure full discussion; and to prioritise children's rights and needs, whilst also attending to their wishes, and the views of the birth family and professionals. Young people's attendance increases with age. Some enjoyed their reviews, others found aspects uncomfortable, but almost all we spoke to thought it was important to attend. Generally, they saw their IROs as independent and influential people.
3. The role of the IRO: There have been long-standing doubts about the effective 'independence' of IROs and their ability/willingness to challenge local authority decisions and actions, notably from the courts and Ofsted. Our study gives a more nuanced picture. Difficulties or shortcomings can occur for many reasons, but on the whole IROs are able to challenge if necessary. The data gives examples. But statutory guidance makes it clear that wherever possible IROs should use informal approaches to resolve disagreements, and we found that IROs usually 'challenge' effectively through discussions with social workers, managers and others, often not recorded on the case file. Social workers saw IROs as powerful figures for monitoring progress, but also often as allies in supporting the agreed plan and arguing for necessary resources.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is considerable interest in central and local government, the social work profession, courts, lawyers, and service user groups about the quality of care and care planning, and the effectiveness of the IRO service. There has been debate about whether IROs should be located in an independent body, rather than local authorities, and whether the role is necessary and a good use of resources. We heard arguments on both sides, but overall our findings suggest that IROs are able to achieve change for children through an independent approach and collaborative working. 
We have disseminated our findings through presentations at practitioner and academic conferences (as listed elsewhere), and through the publication of our full research report and a research briefing, both available free of charge on the CRCF website. We have had one paper published in a practitioner journal and one in a peer-reviewed academic journal. Our findings have been used in professional and policy-level debates about the role of the IRO (see narrative impact section).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2E5A0DE6-5833-416B-9B31-965296423C89</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54abd8efe4a1c6.86195592</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.uea.ac.uk/centre-research-child-family/child-placement/investigation-of-care-planning-and-the-role-of-the-iro</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influencing practitioners' views about the organisational location of the IRO service</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EAE05276-D095-4636-827A-0C0D2B5E2A25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2015 was an important year for the future of the IRO service because the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 gave the Secretary of State for Education the power to issue regulations to establish an independent IRO organisation, but this power was time-limited and expired in the middle of November 2015.
