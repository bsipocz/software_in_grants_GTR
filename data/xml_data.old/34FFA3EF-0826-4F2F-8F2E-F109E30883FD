It addresses the current five-year plan in China to grow the creative economy - newly designated a 'pillar industry' - to 6% of GDP and will engage with a range of key stakeholders in China in the domains of government (national, regional and municipal), business (not least in the legal, technical and creative sectors) and higher education.
Key research questions will cover two core areas:
1. IP, Policy, Regulation and Licensing, looking at: enforcement and regulation issues; digital assets in post-mortem legal contexts; publishing platforms; protocols, licenses and permissions; the benefits of comparative research; national and provincial contexts in China; and the particular model of copyright and collecting societies from the UK context.
2. Platforms, tools and technologies, looking at: business innovation models; professional versus amateur distinctions; fair use agreements; and the unlocking of cultural heritage collections for public benefit.
The Centre is supported by funding from the Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau and will work closely with the RCUK Centre for Copyright and New Business Models in the Digital Age (CREATe, University of Glasgow) and the Horizon Digital Economy Research Hub (University of Nottingham). The UNNC Centre will act as a hub with spokes in partnership with other centres of research in China in Beijing (CASS), Shanghai, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and elsewhere.
As well as policy papers, research monographs, articles, websites, symposia and workshops, we expect outputs to include training and knowledge exchange opportunities. With IP and new digital technologies at the heart of Chinese governmental strategy and UK-China collaborations in trade, industry and the creative arts over the next five year period, we hope this Centre with have genuine social and practical impact in both countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>505291</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ningbo Government</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>NSTB match fund</gtr:description><gtr:id>D37F1F8E-CB67-4D71-8FD8-B67A222BC584</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The projects are still ongoing; a full report will be provided upon completion of the grant.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5871e8b7749.40885748-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The NSTB funds the above projects as a match for the grant, and has been closely involved in their selection, as well as giving advice to the Centre's director at UNNC, Prof Andrew White, on the research questions that would have the most direct impact for them in terms of developing new policies around IP and digital copyright in Ningbo.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Ningbo Buerau of Science and Technology, part of the Ningbo government, funds the following projects that contribute to the work of the AHRC centre for IP and digital copyright in China:

All of these projects are currently engaged in impact activities. Particular opportunities for policy impact are being exploited around the fact that the third revision of the Chinese copyright act is currently underway; several of our teams work closely with members of the judiciary (one includes, as a CI, a former judges in supreme court); they have held consultation events with those involved in drawing up the revision, presented at public events on the topic, such as the Bejing Public conference on fair use in digital domain (Sept 16), and are preparing a final policy recommendation report. In addition, one of our projects explores the potential of setting up a Chinese copyright hub to increase GDP in cultural industries, and to create a bridge between existing Chinese, UK and international initiatives, to facilitate trade of content internationally. To facilitate progress, the Centre's director on our UNNC campus, Prof Andrew White, regularly participates in engagement events, including:
Monday 25 April 2016 
Lunch meeting in Beijing with, among others, Dr Ros Lynch, Director of Copyright &amp;amp; IP Enforcement at the UK Intellectual Property Office (UK IPO) and Peter Ratcliffe, the Detective Chief Inspector, City of London Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU).
Tuesday 26 April 2016
Meeting with academics at Tsinghua University's Law School, followed by attendance at Dr Ros Lynch's lecture &amp;quot;Copyright: Traditional Principles in a Digital World&amp;quot;.
Tuesday 28 June 2016
Organizer and speaker at an AHRC Sharing Event at The University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC). This event provided a forum for scholars, practitioners and businesses who are currently funded by the AHRC Centre to exchange their initial research findings. The whole day event showcased research and ideas on a broad range of topics relevant to the IP and copyright industries in China.
Friday 12 August 2016

1. Intellectual property practice in Creative and IT Industries: A comparison study between China and the UK from the User-centred Perspective (University of Leicester, University of Nottingham, Ningbo)
2. Convergence or differentiation in IP protection strategies and business models? new models for digital film distribution in China (University of Edinburgh,IP Law, Law School Perking University) 
3. Fair use in copyright of works in the digital domain (Anglia Ruskin University, Peking University Law School)
4. Regulating Internet Intermediaries in China: legal and empirical evidence for better policy making (Bournemouth University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences )
5. A Technological Licensing Framework for 3D Printed Content: A Focus on China (University of Exeter, Chinese University of Political Science and Law)
6. China Digital Copyright Exchange (BOP Consulting, Beijing Foreign Studies University Law School)
Furthermore, I also oversee the research conducted with match funding from the University of Nottingham Ningbo, which is being used to fully fund three PhD studentships based at the University of Nottingham Ningbo. The topics of research are as follows:
1. IP and copyright in practice - a comparative study of UK and China's IP system in the music industry
2. Factors determining a firm's innovativeness: an empirical study in e-commerce industry in UK and China
3. How Could Chinese Film Industry Generates Profits From IP Protection 
Finally, the Ningbo Bureau of Sciene and Technology (NSTB) contributed match funded for a number of associated projects. 

On 28 June 2016, we held a project sharing event on our campus at Ningbo, where preliminary findings from the projects were reported, who also shared their insights on methodology and impact. Papers delivered at the event included Prof. Liu Yinliang on &amp;quot;Convergence or differentiation in IP protection strategies and business models? New models for digital film/cultural products distribution in China&amp;quot;; Conor Roche on &amp;quot;Exploring the Potential for a China Digital Copyright Exchange&amp;quot;, Dr. Fangyan Tang on &amp;quot;Intellectual Property Practice in Creative and IT Industries&amp;quot;, Prof. Hingkai Chan on &amp;quot;A Technological Licensing Framework for 3D Printed Content: A Focus on China&amp;quot;, and shorter papers by the PhD students. In December 2016, I traveled to China to meet colleagues there, and to ensure that the NSTB match-funded project were making good progress, of which I was satisfied. On 20 February 2017, we held a second workshop, this time on the University of Nottingham's UK campus, to monitor progress of the AHRC funded projects, and enable them to share their findings with one another, and with other colleagues from pertinent disciplines at the University of Nottingham. Discussions were chaired by me and Prof Andy White, the director of the Centre on our Ningbo campus. We debated the following presentations: 
1. Fair use in copyright of works in the digital domain, by Prof Rohan Kariyawasam 
2. China Digital Copyright Exchange, by Conor Roche 
3. Convergence or differentiation in IP protection strategies and business models? New models for digital film distribution in China, by Dr Xiaobai Shen 
4. Intellectual Property Practices in Creative and IT Industries: A Comparison Study between China and the UK from the User-centred Perspective, by 
Dr Effie Law 
5. Regulating Internet Intermediaries in China: Legal and Empirical Evidence for Better Policy Making, by Drs Lingling Wei and Maurizio Borghi 
6. A Technological Licensing Framework for 3D Printed Content: A Focus on China, by Dr James Griffin 
All projects are making good progress, are preparing papers for publication, and are also working on wider impact activities (see below).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are working with the Ningbo Bureau of Science and Technology to explore how Ningbo can learn from the IPR management experiences of small- and medium- sized companies in developed countries. several of our projects work closely with policy makers in China at local, regional, and national level, and hope to achieve policy impact on patent law and future copyright and IP legislation.
