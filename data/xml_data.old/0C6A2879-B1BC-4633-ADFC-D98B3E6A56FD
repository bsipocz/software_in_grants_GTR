Carbonate platforms are important hotspots of biodiversity. Examples of modern carbonate platforms are the Bahamas, Great Barrier Reef and Maldives. There are also numerous fossil carbonate platforms in the geological record. These were diverse ecosystems that eventually ceased forming when they were uplifted out of the seawater, or drowned as carbonate production was unable to keep up with (relatively) rising waters. These drowning processes are poorly understood. Previous work has mentioned subsidence, sea level, various environmental conditions such as acidification of the ocean, sea surface temperature, and the coupled oxygen-nutrient state of the ocean as various reasons why carbonate platforms drown. Complex scenarios with multiple causes of drowning are likely. This is currently a pressing issue, because understanding how platforms drown is critical to implementing conservation policies for modern ones, where sea level rise is accompanied by multiple environmental changes. Fossil drowning events can be portrayed as warning signs for how modern carbonate platforms may behave in the future.

The Maldives archipelago offers the unique opportunity to study a relatively modern platform. The Maldives archipelago in the central equatorial Indian Ocean is an isolated tropical carbonate platform. A north-south-oriented double row of atolls encloses the Inner Sea of the Maldives. Seismic profiles indicate that the atolls reside on a partially drowned platform, and that the Inner Sea is partly filled with sediments. IODP excursion 359 is designed to drill bore holes in the sedimentary cover and partly sunk platform, and bore holes in the sedimentary drift deposit in the Inner Sea between the atolls. The scientists on this team will reconstruct why this specific platform partly disappeared beneath the waves in the Miocene. It is this partial nature of the drowning that is critical to enable the environmental factors of platform demise to be investigated, as subsidence and sea level rise cannot explain the phenomenon of partial drowning. Adverse local environmental conditions of the platform ecosystem and continued subsidence are key in understanding why the platform partially drowned.

The so-called Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) is a very important environmental feature in the subsurface waters unique to the northern Indian Ocean. The OMZ is characterized by low oxygen and high nutrient content and originates in the western Arabian Sea under the influence of the summer monsoon. It extends as a tongue to the Maldives area and further south. Local upwelling, forced by monsoonal winds, of the coupled low oxygen-high nutrient subsurface waters is unfavourable to the carbonate platform ecosystem. It is poorly known when the OMZ expanded to dominate the northern Indian Ocean but it is widely regarded that this likely happened in the Miocene. Therefore, the partial drowning of the platform may be related to the onset of the OMZ.

This Moratorium proposal offers two projects. In the first project, I propose to precisely date the sedimentary sequences recovered during IODP expedition 359 in order to constrain timing of changes in the architecture of the Maldives carbonate platform, using foraminiferal biostratigraphy. There is insufficient time on board to perform dating with a high temporal resolution. Here, I propose to increase the resolution to precisely date certain key intervals (samples will be taken from the core store at Kochi, Japan). In the second project, I propose to examine the geochemistry and microfossil content of the drift sediments in the Inner Sea, I will establish the timing of the onset of the OMZ, and its evolution through time, specifically with respect to the timing of the carbonate platform demise.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Development and demise of the Maldives carbonate platform, Oxygen Minimum Zone and monsoon in the northern Indian Ocean: IODP expedition 359

Policy: Carbonate platforms are hotspots of biological diversity. Recently, acidification of the ocean due to anthropogenic climate change is often mentioned as one of the culprits that may cause demise of reefal systems which form an integral part of the carbonate platforms. However, there are other fundamental factors that may also play a role in the disappearance (or drowning) of carbonate platforms such as sea level change, temperature of the sea water, productivity of plankton, and currents. Expedition 359 results present a marvellous showcase of the vulnerability of ecosystems such as the Maldives. The most likely outcome of expedition 359 drilling is that environmental changes such as increase in productivity (OMZ) and change in activity of monsoon-driven currents caused the Maldives carbonate platform to diminish its geographical extent. This would be a new paradigm in the understanding of how carbonate platforms respond to climate change, because most researchers claim control of sea level as the main agent to cause drowning of platforms. This knowledge is important for policy makers, who must contemplate the health of the oceans, including the health of the large carbonate platforms which are under threat because of sea level, acidification, temperature, and productivity (eutrophication) changes. 

Outreach: This project is a prime opportunity for ocean drilling to exert impact in the sphere of public outreach. The demise of carbonate platforms is an outstanding topic to stir the imagination of the wider public, highlighting the topic of continuous change or even demise of ecosystems over time. DK and shipboard participants will give the wider public insight in the vulnerability of ecosystems including the example of the Maldives ecosystem through public lectures and films. To this extent, DK has already given about 10 lectures all over the world (e.g. Australia, Brazil, USA, Switzerland, Netherlands, and UK) on the role of ocean drilling in the fundamental understanding of the functioning of ecosystems over time in his capacity as the co-chair of the Science Evaluation Panel in the last 4 years. Although DK is currently rotating off the panel, he aims to continue his lecture series to promote IODP to the wider public. The Maldives story will certainly feature in there. Further, on board the Joides Resolution, it is now customary that outreach is conducted by Skyping with the students at the respective universities, where the shipboard scientists teach, in collaboration with the shipboard educators.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35870</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CF79DCE9-AC15-45E6-9BB8-B09C43F0C4B2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The abrupt onset of the modern South Asian Monsoon winds.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e80fb80030538664ed34f0e47577caa2"><gtr:id>e80fb80030538664ed34f0e47577caa2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Betzler C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>588b6f54e232e6.76183811</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N012739/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62DCC1BF-B512-4BDB-A0C3-02BC17E15F6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biogeochemical Cycles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12C7A68B-3922-4925-9C0B-7FACEC921815</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecosystem Scale Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>723BA0F8-3ECD-4E2A-A39E-44936EAC1517</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean Circulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
