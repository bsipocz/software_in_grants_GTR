This proposal aims to upgrade and replace equipment and facilities across a number of key research areas in Engineering and Physical Sciences at Queen's University Belfast (QUB). 
Specifically, the flagship activity of the Dielectrics research group with world-leading centres in the School of Mathematics and Physics and the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science is seeking to replace and upgrade equipment used for novel dielectric material and structure characterisation (bundle #1). The commissioning of this equipment will ensure our continued success in influencing international academic and industrial programmes, giving the UK a significant opportunity for IP generation from novel advanced functional materials. 
Advanced materials research in QUB is critically dependent on 15 year transmission electron microscope that is rapidly approaching obsolescence. Thus a replacement microscope (bundle #2) is of paramount importance to a large advanced materials portfolio in QUB if we are to meet the demands with maintaining and developing our international, worldwide reputation. 
Mechanical testing and field measurement is not only an integral component within the Engineering &amp;amp; Physical Science faculty at QUB for evaluation of material performance and function across a diverse range activity, but also in Medicine, Health &amp;amp; Life Sciences. Bundle #3 focusses on the replacement and upgrade of mechanical testing and field measurement equipment to support advanced materials, structural component and marine energy development across QUB. The equipment used to support this internationally leading research agenda is between 10-20 years old, and does not meet our current or future requirements for advanced materials testing and development. 
The advanced materials characterisation equipment outlined in bundle #4 is being requested as a direct replacement for equipment that is approaching or has already reached the end of its working-life. This capability is of significant importance to a multitude of University-wide research programmes; the critical mass associated with this research activity straddling every School across the faculties of Engineering &amp;amp; Physical Sciences and Medicine, Health &amp;amp; Life Sciences. 
The internationally leading Centre for Plasma Physics (CPP) is requesting a refresh and uplift to the TARANIS capabilities (bundle #5), which will ensure that CPP maintains at the international scientific cutting edge.
The equipment being requested is of vital strategic value if QUB are to have an active role in contributing to technological evolution and research superiority, its provision will ensure we remain competitive and leading with research funders and industrial partners. The proposed state-of-the-art equipment will be a critical success factor in ensuring that advanced functional materials research at QUB is at the forefront in tackling the technological challenges articulated in key UK and EC materials research strategic and policy documents.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The nature of the Impact that is in response to the installation of the requested equipment is manifest in a change in behaviour in the beneficiaries identified. Starting with academic beneficiaries, the provision of the equipment enhances the cross disciplinary collaboration and knowledge exchange within Queen's between the schools from the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Health and Life Sciences, that will benefit all the Engineering themes, the Physical Sciences, Earth Sciences and Pharmacy, thereby preserving the university's reputation in its key areas of research. Academic beneficiaries include undergraduate and post graduate students and researchers in developing new skills in laser physics, functional materials technology, testing and characterisation. The new or enhanced capabilities will help stimulate academic advancement in the above theme areas.
For industry, the equipment also provides an avenue for skills development, new product development and product testing, quality control and compliance with established standards as well as attracting R&amp;amp;D investment. The capability will also be linked to other universities, government and commercial and standards and testing organisations, such as the National Physical Laboratory, in regard to benchmarking of experimental and characterisation methodology and protocols, quality assurance and fundamental standards.
Through our already founded links with local schools and colleges we see the promotion of our science being an integral part of this proposal. Given that Queen's is the only UK University to be awarded a Silver institutional honour at the Athena SWAN Charter awards, which recognise the commitment of institutions, and science, engineering and technology (SET) departments, to addressing gender inequalities and improving career progression for female academics, we see a real need to involve girls to promote how important our science, supported by this equipment, is to addressing every day challenges the public will benefit through the implementation new medical treatments toward assuring life-long health and wellbeing, the next generation of ICT communication devices, clean energy and transport ,new functional materials and safe food.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1040000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research supported by this grant has led to a collaboration developing cutting edge laser technology between QUB and the company Class5 Lasers.

Societal impact will arise from continued collaboration with Industry and the spin-offs possible from this new technology.
Beyond science, these are expected to arise be in the areas of medical and engineering imaging and security related applications of compact accelerators.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5B09814E-582F-421C-8C92-753B29609222</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e1624bbafb74.69729236</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A laser system has been been comissioned under this equipment grant with the company Class5 lasers with development of pump laser technology by QUB.
