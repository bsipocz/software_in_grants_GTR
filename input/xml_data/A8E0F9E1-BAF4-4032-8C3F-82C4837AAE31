Recent images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter revealed that the Beagle 2 had in fact landed intact on the surface of Mars In 2003 and was not lost as previously assumed. Following discussions with Dr Judith Pillinger of the Beagle 2 mission, the Fitzwilliam Museum will mount an special display using the flight spare of the spacecraft's calibration target, a spot painting by artist Damien Hirst (and the first work of art from Earth to land on another planet) to engage non-specialist audiences with the art, science and essentially multidisciplinary, collaborative nature of space exploration. The display is planned for Autumn 2016 to form part of the Museum's programme for the University of Cambridge's annual Festival of Ideas. Entitled 'Talking Space: Art, Science and Colour on Earth and Mars', it will complement the Fitzwilliam's major Bicentenary exhibition, COLOUR: The Art and Science of Manuscript Illumination. It will also be one of several activities marking the 40th anniversary of the Hamilton Kerr Institute, the Museum's Department of paintings conservation, whose conservators sourced the pigments Professor Colin Pillinger and Hirst used in the spot painting. It will also coincidentally fit with the projected landing of the Schiaparelli technical demonstrator, which forms part of the first mission of the European Space Agency's ExoMars programme.

Specifically, the aims of the project are:

1. To engage visitors to the Fitzwilliam Museum with the science of exploring Mars.

2. To organise in conjunction with the exhibition, a series of talks and lectures. A number of scientists involved in current or past Mars missions have been approached informally and have expressed their willingness to contribute.

3. Through specific activities and events - and as part of the University of Cambridge's broader Widening Participation programme - to engage pupils (aged 14-18) from secondary schools in Cambridge and East Anglia that are under-performing and / or under-represented at the University.

4. Through revisiting the collaboration between Professor Pillinger, Damien Hirst and the art conservators at the Hamilton Kerr Institute, to highlight an example and outcome - a work of art that was also a piece of scientific instrumentation - a collaborative partnership across the arts and sciences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>General activities: 
1. A press release will be drafted and sent to primary media contacts. This will include contacts at major national newspapers and other publications.
2. Details of the display will be featured in the Museum's 'What's On' booklet which has a circulation of c. 45,000 copies.
3. The display will be promoted via the Museum's website, e-newsletter and on social media (Twitter - followers 20,000, Instagram - followers 2,000, Facebook - followers 14,000)
4. We will produce a poster to advertise the display, which will be displayed on site, and at Cambridge School of art, schools, galleries and shops in Cambridge to reach a more general, art-loving audience.
5. A series of blog posts featuring an interview with Dr Pillinger and previews of the footage to be included in the short film, and a post following the school visits will be produced for the University of Cambridge Museums Blog (https://camunivmuseums.wordpress.com). 

Targeted activities:
5. There will be a special (targeted) mailing (print and electronic) to recruit schools to visit the display which will be done by the Museum in collaboration with the University's Widening Participation Office. Estimated reach: 30 schools in the Eastern region.
7. The Museum's Learning Department will prepare targeted e-mailings and notifications on the Fitzwilliam Museum's education social media sites (Facebook and Twitter) prior to specific events, focusing in particular on adult learners, art students and families. Estimated number of recipients: Social Media 1,500, and 500 for e-mailings).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8588</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Dr Judith Pillinger offered us the chance to display the spot painting prepared for the Beagle 2 space mission by artist Damien Hirst. The painting is the flight spare that was used as the instrument calibration target on boards the Mars spacecraft. To make a display that would have impact we developed four interpretative illustrated panels to tell the story and context of this artwork/scientific instrument. We also used some of the grant to get a company to edit rushes of film footage of Dr Colin Pillinger working with artist Damien Hirst into a film for people to understand more about this collaboration. This film needed to be shown on a screen which was specially purchased for this display, and mounted in a construction which was placed alongside the display case containing the spot painting itself. 

Dr Pillinger recently told us: &amp;quot;To date the film has not been used anywhere else. I think the value of the film is greatest when shown alongside the actual calibration target hence I have resisted just putting it online for the sake of it. There are several major exhibitions in the pipeline and I am sure that the Mars artwork will be in demand. The film is timeless (indeed will have added value as Beagle 2 increasingly becomes recognised as one of our heritage space projects) and any future use of it will acknowledge STFC's contribution to its production.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>A68BC3BB-AF01-4BCD-AE9E-3E02E3554A35</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition display was on show in the Courtyard of the Fitzwilliam Museum from 13 September - 20 November 2016, coinciding with our very popular exhibition COLOUR: the art and science of illuminated manuscripts.

On 1 October 2016 our theme was Artful Science, which included a talk aimed at ages 10 and over entitled &amp;quot;Colour in Space&amp;quot; by Jim Clemmet, Chief Engineer for Beagle 2. Here is a report on the afternoon from our Learning Associate (Families) - Fliss Mottram: 

&amp;quot;We had 86 visitors in total (more than double any of previous September's Family Firsts). 4% were new to the Museum. 

We got lovely feedback from Marta's family tours, engaging family learning. One parent particularly enjoyed 'the opportunity to focus on an activity with the children'. 

Thanks to Jim for your fantastic talk. We were truly honoured to have you share your knowledge and expertise with our young visitors. The talk was very busy (58 people) and well received. Comments included
&amp;quot;Amazing quality speaker. Thank you&amp;quot;
And: 
&amp;quot;I thought this talk was an excellent bridge between the arts and sciences. Too often people bracket art museums as a leisure or academic entity- as belonging to the humanities. Talks such as this break down such false dichotomies. Creativity can only flourish in such an inter-disciplinary environment. Marvellous.
