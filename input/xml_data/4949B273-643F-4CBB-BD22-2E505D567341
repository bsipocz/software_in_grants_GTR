landscape, hosts, vectors and an emerging disease of potatoes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/L011840/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Potato is the world's third most important staple food and Potato virus Y (PVY) is the most important virus disease in most potato production systems. In the last few decades recombinant strains of PVY have emerged in Europe and more recently in N America that are spreading and are associated with serious tuber damage. Factors responsible for the emergence and spread of these new strains are unknown but PVY is an ideal system to study the ecology and evolution of this infectious disease because all of the components, the virus, the host and the vector, are relatively well characterised. In this project we will investigate genetic, physiological, ecological, evolutionary and environmental factors as a dynamic network of variables affecting disease spread. We will identify the most important variables and how they influence PVY spread within and between potato plants. 

This project addresses the significant challenges to agricultural production posed by changes in climate and the limitations on the use of agrochemicals in Europe. Potato production requires high levels of inputs to ensure high yields of crop for consumption as well as high quality of seed tuber planting material. PVY and many other virus diseases are transmitted by aphids and the changing weather patterns with warmer, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters is resulting in increasing aphid populations with the earlier arrival of aphids into the crops. The information gained will be used to develop quantitative and predictive models of disease risk in different agro-ecosystems and devise strategies for targeted intervention with agrochemicals for improved disease control. PVY infects a wide range of other crops including vegetables, tobacco and fruit and the underlying concepts, models and disease management tools developed in the project will have broad applicability in other agricultural systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The UK component will examine mature plant resistance (MPR) to PVY and provide data on aphid phenology. Results will be combined with data collected by the US collaborators on spatial epidemiology and interactions between landscape, hosts and vectors to describe the ecology of this important virus disease and emergence of new strains. MPR has been little studied since the 1980s and while there is evidence that it prevents virus infection in potato tubers in the late growing season and reduces the plants susceptibility, sometimes completely, the mechanism behind MPR remains unknown. Since MPR varies with cultivar and environmental conditions its onset is currently impossible to predict. The main, but poorly tested, hypothesis that we will investigate is that changes in host physiology affect translocation of virus in the phloem from leaves to tubers. We will investigate phloem connections between leaves and tubers, at different stages of development, and the effect of flower and fruit formation on tuber sink strength. The sink/source transition will be manipulated and variation between genotypes will be examined. We will use GFP-tagged virus infectious clones to test whether phloem entry and translocation of PVY varies at different stages or with cultivar. Gene expression in inoculated leaves will be analysed by comparison of microarray data from different virus strains and potato cultivars. Numbers of infected tubers and sprouts of progeny tubers will be tested to assess the potential for transmission to next generation. The goal is to identify physiological and gene expression markers for onset of MPR that can be used in field assays. 
Information obtained about virus infection and movement through the plant will help to devise a risk index for different cultivars at key growth stages. Further work in collaboration with other partners will involve validation and optimisation of the markers and their use in predictive models for virus risk.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>not applicable</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>564383</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Wisconsin-Madison</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Spatial Epidemiology of a Vector-Borne Potato Virus: Interactions between Landscape, Hosts and Vectors</gtr:description><gtr:id>76927A20-E11D-47A9-B80C-49353BCF7719</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d857ef7de335.50755608-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>see web pages</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>see web pages

Meeting was attended by personnel from UK and USA collaborator labs. The meeting aimed to discussed research accomplishment and future plans. Richard Harrington of Rothamsted research has now retired and James Bell has taken over on the project and will continue to provide advice and information on aphid phenology data in UK.

Pankaj Kumar (Research fellow) presented the experimental data for the UK team. MPR onset experiments showed no systemic movement of PVY-O into foliar tissue at the flowering stage in all cultivars tested (Desiree, Atlantic, Maris Piper and Shepody). In addition, resistance was observed against PVY-N and recombinant strains (PVY-NTN, PVY-NWi) in foliar tissues of all cultivars except Shepody. However, examination of PVY infection in tubers from plants inoculated at flowering stage showed that the recombinant strains can infect tubers of all cultivars even at the flowering stage. Thus, MPR does not protect tuber infection by recombinant PVY strains. This is the first report MPR study against recombinant PVY strains. 
CFDA translocation experiments to study solute transport have backed up and explained the above result. There was no CFDA transport from the inoculated leaves to systemic leaves at the time the plant is flowering, but there was still a (reduced) level of CFDA transport to tubers; sufficient to allow virus infection. 
GFP-tagged PVY-N was studied in the inoculated leaves at four developmental stages and was found to enter the phloem at all stages, suggesting that phloem entry is not a limiting step to virus infection, even at flowering when MPR protects foliar tissues.
Furthermore, identification of a marker for the MPR stage was done using FTIR. Two markers were identified that correlate to oxalate levels increase in source leaves from tuber-development stage onwards, and reduction in nitrate level at the flowering stage. These markers would be useful to predict MPR to help understand when plants had some protection against PVY-O. However, since we have now shown that MPR is not effective against recombinant PVY strains and these recombinants are the most prevalent infection pressure today, the use of these markers is probably of limited utility.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb837c65db55.18191476</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project meeting 24-25 April 2014, Cornell University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>49C6B846-B35C-40B6-835F-5D201BD0B10A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Personnels involved in the project from UK and US partner labs met to discuss research activity and future plans. Outcomes from 8 months research work since the begining of project were shared. Lesley Torrance (University of St Andrews/JHI) briefed the audience that onset of mature plants resistance (MPR) was studied in four potato cultivars using four PVY strains (PVY-O, PVY-NWi, PVY-N and PVY-NTN). For this, PVY infection in non-inoculated upper leaves was checked at four growth stages of potato plants. Early results showed that PVY-O infection in upper non-inoculated leaves was stopped at tuber bulking stage. However, PVY-NWi infection in upper non-inoculated leaves was stopped at last growth stage i.e.. flowering stage. Solute transport from source leaves to sink tissues was studied to find out any change in phloem transport after MPR onset. These studies were completed until tuber bulking stage and results did not show any change in phloem connection or unloading. Solute transport at flowering stage was not finished.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb1762c93424.79805656</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference: Advances in plant virology 2015, Birmingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DE2949A9-70BA-4A8F-8760-AD8B5CE47EE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pankaj Kumar (Research Fellow, University of St Andrews) presented a talk titled ;Studies on Mature Plant Resistance Against Potato Virus Y in Solanum tuberosum L.; at Advances in Plant Virology 2015 conference.

The talk generated lot of interest among audience since MPR is poorly understood phenomenon.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589b192a909b08.57860257</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster presentation in 13th International Plant Virus Epidemiology Symposium at  the University of Avignon, France (6 June to 10 June 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0DBF14B8-319D-4638-BCEC-34EB76C82184</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof. Lesley Torrance presented a poster titled &amp;quot;RECOMBINANT STRAINS OF POTATO VIRUS Y OVERCOME MATURE PLANT RESISTANCE IN SOLANUM TUBEROSUML.&amp;quot; at 13th International Plant Virus Epidemiology Symposium organised by the University of Avignon, France (6 June to 10 June 2016).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589d0339943d70.93821084</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://colloque.inra.fr/ipve2016</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Potato virus Y (PVY) is one of the most serious pathogens of cultivated solanaceous crops worldwide, reducing both yield and quality. New recombinant strains of PVY have emerged and are increasingly found infecting potato in most potato production systems. Natural host resistance, conferred by resistance (R) genes, is considered one of the best strategies to control virus diseases. However, identification and introgression of such R genes into commercial cultivars is not facile and so other strategies are required to achieve disease control. Mature plant resistance (MPR) is a poorly understood phenomenon where older plants become more resistant to infection by plant pathogens. A thorough understanding of MPR would potentially be a valuable component of PVY management in seed potato production. The role of the UK team in this project is to investigate MPR, to understand the mechanism and factors affecting onset. This information will be integrated into other project findings to understand PVY spatial ecology and assist disease management.
The objectives of this project were: 
1. Determine the potato growth stage when MPR against PVY occurred in different host genotypes (year 1 and 2).
2. Examining the change in source/sink relationship within plant with respect to solute transport during MPR (year 1 and 2).
3. Studying within-plant virus movement to determine if PVY is prevented from entering the phloem in inoculated leaves during MPR (year 2 to 4).
4. Studying global gene expression change (60K potato array) and other changes in physiology before and after MPR onset to identify key genes involved in MPR (year 3 to 5).
5. Identification and development of diagnostic markers for MPR (year 4 and 5). 

Report of Outcomes To Date

Objective 1. Determine the potato growth stage when MPR against PVY occurred in different host genotypes (year 1 and 2).

The onset of MPR against different viral strains (PVYO, PVYN, PVYNTN and PVYN-Wi) was studied in four cultivars of potato: Maris Piper, Atlantic, Desiree and Shepody. Four stages of plant development (6 leaf, stolon development, tuber bulking and flowering) were identified and potato plants were challenged by manual inoculation with different PVY strains at each stage. Decrease in infection was assumed to indicate the onset of MPR. The results showed that PVY infection in upper non-inoculated leaves was significantly affected by host genotype, PVY strain-host genotype interaction and PVY strain-growth stage of host plants combination. 

All PVY strains infected the inoculated leaves of all plants at all growth stages but the ELISA results revealed that there were variations among cultivars, stages and strains with respect to PVY infection of the upper, non-inoculated, leaves. For example, in cv Maris Piper MPR against PVYO was established by the stolon stage (36-40 days after planting). In cvs Atlantic and Shepody, resistance was established by the tuber bulking stage (50-52 days after planting) and flowering stage respectively. Resistance against PVYN was initiated or established earlier in the upper non-inoculated leaves of late maturing cvs (Maris Piper, Desiree), its onset was delayed in early maturing cvs (Atlantic and Shepody). In contrast to PVYO and PVYN results, decrease in plants infected by PVYNTN and PVYNWi in non-inoculated leaves was observed only at flowering stage in all cvs. However, the percentage of PVYNTN and PVYNWi infected plants varied depending on cv. For example, cvs Maris Piper, Desiree and Atlantic showed either no infection or less than 20% infection. On the other hand cv Shepody showed higher percentage of infection in systemic leaves when compared to the other cultivars. These results clearly established that at the flowering stage the majority of plants had resistance against systemic leaf infection of PVY strains with the exception of cv Shepody.

Tubers harvested from plants infected at the flowering stage were tested by ELISA and the results showed that cvs Atlantic and Maris Piper were completely resistant to PVYO as tubers remained virus free. However, 25% plants of cv Maris Piper showed PVYN infection in tubers, and 100% plants of cv Atlantic produced tubers infected with PVYN. Tubers harvested from cv Desiree remained free from PVYN and PVYO infection. However, all tubers tested of all cvs were found infected with recombinant PVY strains PVYNTN and PVYN-Wi This was the most significant result of these studies and indicates that these recombinant strains can overcome MPR in potato. To our knowledge no previous study has been done for MPR against PVYNTN and PVYN-Wi. Tuber tests for other strains and growth stages are still ongoing and a manuscript is in preparation.

Objective 2. Examining the change in source/sink relationship within plant with respect to solute transport during MPR

Plant viruses utilize the phloem metabolite/solute transport pathway to move to different parts of the plants. One of the plausible reasons for the mechanism of MPR may be a change in source-sink relationship between source leaves, therefore, solute transport from source leaves to sink tissues was studied during the tuber development (growth stage before MPR) and flowering (growth stage at which MPR was observed) to investigate whether there were changes in phloem connections and solute unloading from source leaves to sink tissues between the two stages.

The phloem mobile fluorescent probe carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) was used to analyse changes in solute transport. Translocation of CFDA from source leaves to sink tissues corresponds to the long distance movement of virus and therefore any change in CFDA translocation and unloading may reflect a change in the virus movement pathway.

During the tuber development stage, CFDA was detected in the veins of sink leaves indicating that the solute transport pathway from source leaves to sink leaves was active. Similarly, extensive unloading of CFDA was detected in tubers at this stage. These results suggested that transport of solutes from source leaves to sink tissues is active and solutes are unloaded in sink tissues at this stage. 

CFDA translocation and unloading in sink tissues at flowering stage showed a change in sink preference. At flowering stage, CFDA unloading was not detected in developing leaves at the top of the stem (tissue above the leaf in which CFDA was infiltrated) but CFDA translocation to tubers still continued at flowering stage. However, the quantity of CFDA reaching tubers decreased at flowering stage. Unloading of CFDA at flowering stage was observed in tubers of all cvs albeit at very low level. These results suggested that while phloem connectivity is unchanged during MPR stage, unloading of solute to tubers decreases at the flowering stage.

Objective 3. Studying within-plant virus movement to determine if PVY is prevented from entering the phloem in inoculated leaves during MPR.
PVY movement into phloem tissue was investigated in inoculated leaf tissue by live cell imaging of GFP expression from a PVYN infectious cDNA clone at 4 growth stages. Apart from variation in number and size of lesions among four cvs these results showed that PVYN can enter into phloem tissue at all growth stage including flowering stage which coincides with MPR. Therefore, PVY is not prevented from entering the phloem in inoculated leaves during MPR. This work is ongoing.

Objectives 4 and 5. Identification and development of diagnostic marker for MPR
We have tried to identify a marker for the MPR stage using FTIR. We identified two markers that correlate with an increase in oxalate levels in source leaves from the tuber-development stage onwards, and a reduction in nitrate level at the flowering stage. These markers would be useful to predict MPR to help understand when plants had some protection against PVYO. However, since we have now shown that MPR is not effective against recombinant PVY strains and these recombinants are the a prevalent infection pressure, the use of these markers is probably of limited utility. However, the observation is of interest in studying the general mechanisms of MPR. These and gene expression studies are ongoing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project is still on-going but we have had preliminary discussions with groups in the UK (such as SASA and AHDB Potatoes) interested in aphid forecasting in seed potato crops to discuss how we might take the information and outputs forward to apply to UK crops.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C6EDB040-9BAC-4347-9B0E-699DDBC9C5E8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cb3c9342bd20.46275096</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.hutton.ac.uk/potato-virus-y</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A microarray is a laboratory tool used to detect the expression levels of large number of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome.

Inoculated leaf tissue samples were harvested at 1, 4 and 8 dpi and subjected to whole genome transcript profiling using the 60K array of the potato genome. Sequences of the expressed transcripts were received recently and we are starting to analyse the data. We hope to discover MPR-associated genes which are differentially expressed between PVYNTN and PVYO inoculated leaves as well as between the 6-leaf and flowering growth stages. Preliminary analysis after 2-way ANOVA and pairwise comparison (mock vs. each PVY strain) at each time point showed that a large number of genes were differentially expressed in PVYO and PVYNTN treated leaves at the 6 leaf stage compared to the same treatment at the flowering stage.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589d08ea8a2a61.42225797</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Microarray</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is an analytical technique used to identify organic and inorganic materials.
