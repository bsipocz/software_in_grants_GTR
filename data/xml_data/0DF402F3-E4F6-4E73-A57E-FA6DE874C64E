In particular the initiatives
related to employment and education, research and development (R&amp;amp;D), and climate change.
Employment and education: The 'Agenda for new skills and jobs' aims to ensure that people are equipped with the right skills to do the
jobs of today and tomorrow. BESTER also has the potential to contribute to the European tax base and provide employment opportunities both through the project
directly and through the commercial exploitation of the outputs. For example, this project directly creates or secures at least 6-8 jobs and in
order to exploit the outcomes, a European renewable chemical plant would likely employ 40-50 direct employees with many
indirect employees (scientists, engineers, construction etc.). Currently the only operating ABE plant globally is in the USA. For production
to be viable in Europe, second generation feedstocks needs to be applied, and plant economics need to be improved. The addition of fully
renewable esters to the product portfolio of an ABE plant will move manufacturing further up the value chain and improve product LCA
characteristics. Both of these will enable higher values to be sought in the market place leading to better plant economics.
Climate change: This focus on building ester capability into an ABE plant in order to improve economics also feeds into the aims of the
2015 Paris Agreement in which 195 countries agreed to tackle climate change.
Life Quality: Biochemical production technologies are likely to be economically relevant. However, increased quality of life stems not only
from increased monetary resources, but also from a more sustainable environment. This would improve the quality of air for EU countries as
a consequence of a considerable reduction of GHG emissions by the adoption of these biochemical production technologies.
Decarbonisation of industrial processes is a major element in the BESTER project.
R&amp;amp;D: The work in BESTER builds upon previous and current successful partnerships. GBL and UULM have previously collaborated on an
ERA-Net project (REACTIF), and GBL has worked with Borregaard on several projects demonstrating that BALI sugars are a good substrate
for growth and chemical production by GBL strains. SINTEF and UROS currently work together in ERASysAPP SYSTERACT, in which the
FAIRDOMHub is used for data management. SINTEF has previously worked with Borregaard, one of the world's largest integrated
biorefineries from lignocellulose, on biotechnological processes using BALI substrate. The project participants represent some of Europe's
leading experts in their fields. By combining resources and expertise, BESTER will maximise resources and reduce risks and costs.
Through strengthening the existing bonds and bringing in additional partners with complementary competences (PROC, ICL), the project will
yield high added value for European trans-national R&amp;amp;D and innovation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>176852</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R021740/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>18D298A9-FFE3-432F-B077-E3B703272E29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemical engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>63F3D26F-05D5-477D-9F77-C6C8AC47C7DD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Research approaches</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
