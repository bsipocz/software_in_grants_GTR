Before water reaches a customer's tap, it must pass through a train of processes to remove the impurities from the water before it is safe to drink. The bulk of the contaminants are removed from the water in the process of coagulation and flocculation. Here, a destabilising chemical, such as an iron or aluminium salt is added to the water which enables dissolved, colloidal and particulate material to aggregate into large, fragile particles called flocs. In most water treatment plants in the world, these particles are removed by a sedimentation or flotation process. Any fine residual particles remaining are then usually removed by a sand filter. Failure to remove these particles results in high turbidity in the filtered water, which can reduce the efficacy of disinfection and the particles can be a vehicle for more toxic compounds entering drinking water. For this reason, turbidity in drinking water is strictly controlled. In the UK, a target value for turbidity in drinking water is 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). Recent revision documents from the European Commission indicate that this will soon move to a mandatory value of 1 NTU, with a target value of 0.5 NTU.The properties of the floc particles that form has a strong influence on how well they are removed by the clarification and filtration processes. If the flocs are too small or break apart too easily, water quality is compromised. The composition and structure of the floc is a function of a number of factors, including the source water matrix, the coagulant and flocculation chemicals used and the mixing regime deployed. Measuring the character and the strength of the flocs can therefore provide some very useful information on how well they may be removed in water treatment systems. To date, floc strength tests have concentrated on characterisation of large scale floc breakage products. This can significantly underestimate the concentration of small particles in a heterogeneous system containing a wide range of particle sizes. However, it is the small particles (normally centred around 1 um for most filtration conditions used in practice) that can cause operational difficulties because they are least well removed in a filter. The intellectual contribution of this work is in developing an operationally applicable and relevant floc strength test that integrates particle size and particle removal in depth filtration. For the first time we will investigate floc strength in terms of the formation and concentration of small particles before and after floc breakage by measuring floc strength in terms of the small particles around 1 um. The project will therefore deliver a methodology to determine floc strength through understanding the formation of problem particles. In addition we will establish how the system water quality and coagulation conditions influence floc strength and the formation of particles that cause turbidity in drinking water. Finally we will develop coagulation control strategies to limit the formation of FBP to enable longer filter run times and more effective filtration which could be applied on full-scale water treatment systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Whilst the proposed work will be of great interest to those in other research groups concerned with particle characterisation, the direct beneficiaries of this research will be those working in potable water supply in the UK and across the world. Given that nearly all water treatment plants in the developed world utilise coagulation and floc formation, the outputs from this research will be very relevant to water utilities, contractors and water quality regulators, such as the UK Drinking Water Inspectorate. The development and implementation of a suitable floc strength test will help deliver higher quality drinking water quality by minimising turbidity in the treated water. This will be of direct benefit to the general public who consume this water. The Centre for Water Science at Cranfield University has very close working relationships with the stakeholders involved in potable water production which has given the Centre a strong track record in being able to inform and influence the water community. The results of this research will be disseminated via a knowledge transfer day workshop of the Cranfield led EPSRC Network on Potable Water and Supply (EPSRC seed funding) where opportunities and challenges associated with implementing the research will be discussed with water supply companies. The developed tools would then be available to be used immediately by those working in water production to increase filter run times by developing control strategies in treatment processes to minimise the formation of particles that cause turbidity in drinking water. An increase in filter run times has advantages in terms of reducing water loss and treatment costs associated with filter cleaning where up to 5% of the total water produced by a WTP may be used. Water regulators would benefit from the research by having a tool that could be used to help demonstrate best practice for control of particles in drinking water. One of the objectives of this research is to produce a roadmap to identify future opportunities to indirect beneficiaries where the particle characterisation and floc strength tools developed could be used in applications where control of particle size is critical. By developing the research roadmap, a platform will be developed which will identify exploitation routes of the floc strength test and particle characterisation tools. Firstly, this will enable the principal investigator (PI) and post doctoral research assistant (PDRA) to further develop their academic careers from follow on research proposals in directly linked research areas such as in understanding how upstream floc formation influences filter capture mechanisms. Secondly, this approach will also enable the researchers to identify more indirect applications of the particle characterisation tools such as in microbiology for control of pathogenic microorganisms in drinking water (such as enteric bacteria and parasitic cysts like Crytosporidium), wastewater treatment, paper manufacture and paint production. Here, the timescales of the benefits will be realised over a much longer timescale in 3-5 years time due to the time taken to break into different research fields. In addition to being able to develop their academic profiles from the research, the PI and PDRA staff working on this project will develop key research and professional skills that can be applied in employment sectors. One of the key challenges of academic research is to effectively communicate complex science to less specialised audiences. The main focus of the professional development to be undertaken as part of this project will be in developing the communication skills of the PI and PDRA. The PDRA will also enrol on a bespoke training programme run by the School of Applied Sciences that develops skills in written and oral communication, client relationships and commercialisation of research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100048</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Yorkshire Water</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Characterising polymer dosing for filtration with variable pH conditions</gtr:description><gtr:id>70734DA6-69C2-4627-B68D-AE79FC7BB77A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Better understanding of full scale polymer dosing practice for water treatment process scientists.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546331e2828d43.24604081-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Site for analysis to take place.
Access to source water and chemicals.
Intellectual contribution to discussions on polymer dosing.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Identified differences in polymer operation with pH changes for treatment of highly coloured, NOM laden source waters 
Dosing polymer at increasing pH resulted in significantly larger flocs that remained larger when exposed to higher shear rates, however there was also evidence that more, smaller particles were released when the pH condition increased from pH 4 to 5. This explained some of the observations seen at a live water treatment works where an increase in pH leads to an increase in headloss across the filters. 
The results of this work has provided a mechanism as to why filtration deteriorates: a change in floc property causing a change in filtration. At pH 5 the flocs were very large, being over double the size of flocs when no polymer was dosed. The implication of this being that the large floc that form when polymer was added block the pores of the filter and therefore increase the filter headloss. The obvious suggestion of this work being that more careful control of coagulation pH is required in order to ensure that the pH of the coagulated water is maintained below pH 4.85 to prevent these large, filter-blinding flocs from forming. 
This implies that lower pH could be used for treatment of the water, thereby reducing the coagulant dose and producing a floc that removes the need for additional backwashing.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>158000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NERC CASE</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>NE/L009218/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>7B559C60-AA9E-49C7-91D6-AD13B7E32695</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463373f46c574.10889333</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>To date, most tests that have been used for measuring floc strength have concentrated on characterisation of large flocs in the system using a parameter such as the median or maximum floc size before and after floc breakage. This is because the bulk of the floc also represents the bulk of the pollutants removed from the water in clarification systems. In many experimental studies, floc size measurements are made using an instrument that measures particle volume. Laser diffraction (LD) is the method most widely used for this purpose, where the instruments can size particles in the range 20-2,000,000 nm. However, it is the small particles that come into the colloidal size range that also need to be considered in the context of floc breakage as these are the particles that will challenge filters, cause operational difficulties and include micro-organisms. The scope of this work was to assess for the first time how a new nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) system was able to measure nanosized particles and determine if they may be used for measuring sub-micron sized floc particles effectively. The results were compared against two commonly used particle sizing instruments based on LD and dynamic light scattering (DLS).
The NTA required significant operator training and experience for measurement of particles and in most cases settings needed to be optimised for a given particle size range meaning that samples of unknown particle size and concentration cannot be effectively measured because prior knowledge of the sample is needed in order to select the appropriate settings. The results have highlighted some of the key issues associated with accurately measuring sub-micron sized particles quickly and easily. All of the instruments were successful in measuring particle size for mono-modal particles between 100-500 nm, but did not provide a good indication of particle concentration. When the instruments were challenged with more complicated particle systems composed of bimodal or unknown particle sizes, the instruments struggled. The NTA instrument is therefore appropriate for a qualitative understanding of nano sized floc particles. However, the limitations of the NTA means that going beyond measurement of bulk floc characteristics (those particles &amp;gt;10 um) is not currently feasible, because although the range of particle sizes measured may be accurate, no indication of particle concentration or distribution can be gleaned. 
The impact of this research has been the successful validation of an NTA for measuring nanoparticles relatively quickly, with little sample preparation beyond some dilution. The NTA instrument does have limitations, however it is another tool available for scientists and engineers for measurement of nano-sized particles in environmental sample . In our laboratories, the instrument has been used for measurement and understanding of water and wastewater floc particles, titanium dioxide particles and aggregates and natural organic matter colloids. Taking this forward, we will be using the NTA system to analyse and diagnose problems and associated with full scale water treatment plants, particularly those associated with filtration. 
The findings from this research were presented as an oral talk at the World Filtration Congress in Salzburg in April 2012. Two research papers are in preparation for publication, one detailing the calibration of NTA system in comparison to the LD instrument and the second investigating the measurement of floc breakage products using a combined approach of the LD and NTA tools. The post doctoral researcher who worked full-time on this project has successfully been able to use the knowledge and skills acquired in this work and has been able to secure a follow on position at Bangor University in the School of Ocean Sciences on a three year contract investigating particle size in situ in the ocean.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>For monitoring improvements in output water quality from drinking water treatment plants and optimisation of the treatment processes required for water purification.
