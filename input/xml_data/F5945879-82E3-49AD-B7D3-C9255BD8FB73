Peace settlements and military victories are assumed to bring an end to violence, yet they are often followed by high levels of crime and fighting among former enemies, even among former allies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Questions about post-war violence are particularly important in unrecognised states born out of violent struggles, as these are vulnerable entities in the international system from the very outset. Unrecognised - or de facto - states lack international recognition but function as state-like entities in that they control the population within their territories. While unrecognised states have been features on the international scene for decades, the fall of the USSR and subsequent separatist conflicts gave rise to several such state-like entities - Abkhazia, Chechnya, Nagorno Karabkah, South Ossetia, and Transnistria.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study theorises and examines the causes and consequences of post-war violence within these unrecognised states, following a two-pronged research strategy. First, based on statistical analyses of survey data, the study assesses how the inhabitants? experiences of criminal and political violence affect&amp;nbsp; their views of the unrecognised states and their regimes. Second, the study traces how the organisation and nature of war-time violence shapes post-war peace and stability (or lack thereof).&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79605</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Arranging and hosting stakeholder conference (de facto states)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA1DC157-D0FE-4BE8-A629-4CD8474854CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On September 11 and 12, 2014, scholars, policy-makers, and practitioners working on and in so-called de facto states came together at UCL to discuss questions related to security and governance. The project grew out of Dr. Kristin M. Bakke's ESRC-funded project on &amp;quot;After the War Ends,&amp;quot; which investigates state-building in de facto states born out of violent struggles.

De facto states are discrete territorial regions that aspire to separate from the internationally recognized states that they are officially part of. As such, de facto states are sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;breakaway regions&amp;quot; by their &amp;quot;parent&amp;quot; states. De facto states possess domestic sovereignty in the sense that they control and administer most or all of the territory they claim (this is what makes them stand apart from other separatist regions), but de facto states do not have international legal recognition as states. Rather, they become unrecognized states or partially recognized states, entities denied international legal sovereignty by all or many members of the existing community of states. 

Despite the lack of international legal recognition, many de facto states have proven to be remarkably enduring (think of Northern Cyprus and Taiwan). In the post-Soviet region, Abkhazia, Nagorno Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Transdniestria have survived as unrecognized or partially recognized states since the early 1990s, as has Somaliland in Africa. In Asia, Tamil Eelam functioned like a de facto state from 1986 to 2009, when Sri Lankan forces regained control of the territory, and in the Middle East, Iraqi Kurdistan has, more or less, functioned like a de facto state since 1991. Per one count (by Nina Caspersen and Gareth Stansfield), we have seen the emergence of 21 de facto states since World War II, and recent events in eastern Ukraine, as well as IS(IS)'s emerging control in Iraq and Syria, have brought fore the question of whether we are witnessing new de facto states in the making.

De facto states are not, by definition, born out of violent struggles, but most are, as existing states are generally reluctant to let part of their territory go without putting up a fight. As a result, both scholarly and policy interest in de facto states is often tied up with questions related to security, conflict resolution, and post-war governance. The conference at UCL situated de facto states within these wider questions. 

For a long time, neither scholars nor policy-makers outside de facto states knew much about their inner workings. The assumption was often that that these were unstable and crime-ridden entities. However, many de facto states have developed institutions of governance and provide public goods to the population within their boundaries. Like recognized states, they do so to varying degrees, and an emerging body of work has begun to analyze these dynamics. From a policy perspective, regardless of whether one wants de facto states to be integrated into their parent states or gain full international recognition, an informed debate about how these political entities function and how they are (or are not) prepared for either integration or independent statehood is important. The fate of de facto states matter not only for the population within these entities and their parent states, but for regional and international stability. 

The UCL conference was organized around six panels, which addressed questions related to governance, security, the role of third parties, de facto states' relationships to their neighbors and wider international community, displacement and human rights, as well as reconciliation. Each panel featured a mix of researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers, to facilitate discussion among people who are interested in-and knowledgeable about-de facto states from different perspectives. The conference featured speakers working on and in several different de facto states and (post-)conflict situations-Abkhazia, Iraqi Kurdistan, Kosovo, Nagorno Karabakh, Transdniestria, and Somaliland-and with expertise and experience related to governance, peace-building, mediation and conflict management, border changes, demographic changes, human rights, and reconciliation.

The conference began with a discussion about governance, featuring a presentation based on comparative survey evidence from Abkhazia, Nagorno Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Transdniestria, by John O'Loughlin from the University of Colorado and Gerard Toal from Virginia Tech. Liana Kvarcheliya from the Center for Humanitarian Programs, an NGO based in Abkhazia, followed up with an insider perspective on governance in Abkhazia. Donnacha &amp;Oacute; Beach&amp;aacute;in from Dublin City University provided an overview of election dynamics in the post-Soviet de facto states, and Mira Sovakar from Conciliation Resources discussed the nexus between governance and peacebuilding. 

The following panel addressed questions related to security. Kristin M. Bakke from UCL made an argument linking governance and security to internal legitimacy in the post-Soviet de facto states. Natella Akaba, Chair of the Public Chamber in Abkhazia, gave a presentation about the war in Abkhazia and its lingering effects, and Tabib Huseynov from Saferworld discussed the tensions between security concerns and legitimacy in Abkhazia and Nagorno Karabakh. Professor Gareth Stansfield from the University of Exeter talked about the Kurdistan Region in Iraq and the ways in which the recent threat of ISIS has shaped the Kurdistan de facto state.

The first day of the conference ended with a panel on the role of third parties. Stefan Wolff from the University of Birmingham drew on both his research and practical experience in discussing challenges of mediation, concluding that mediation only works if the parties want it to work. Keith Shannon, Deputy Director of the Easter Europe and Central Asia Directorate at the UK FCO, talked about his experience with mediation and contact programs in Transdniestria, based on his previous work as the UK Ambassador to Moldova. Roy Reeves, CMG, drew on his experience working for the OSCE and the EU, talking about the role of international governmental organizations in conflict management. Craig Oliphant from Saferworld concluded with a discussion about the role of confidence building from an NGO perspective.

The second day of the conference kicked off with a panel on de facto states' relationships in the neighbourhood. Lee Seymour from the University of Amsterdam gave a presentation on the consequences of border changes, arguing that adherence to existing borders might be destabilizing. Arda Inal-Ipa, from the Center for Humanitarian Programs in Abkhazia, gave an in-depth account of Abkhazia's relationships to Russia, Turkey, and Georgia, arguing for de-isolation. Arzu Abdullayeva, Co-chair of the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly in Baku, discussed the independent Civil Minsk Process and its role in conflict settlement in Nagorno Karabakh. Gentian Zyberi from the University of Oslo concluded the panel by talking about some of the challenges facing Kosovo, which is now recognized by nearly 110 states in the international system. 

The second panel of the day addressed questions related to demography, displacement, and human rights. Monica Duffy Toft from the University of Oxford gave a presentation on the relationship between demographic transitions and political conflict. Karen Ohanjanyan, Coordinator of the Nagorno-Karabakh Committee &amp;quot;Helsinki Initiative-92,&amp;quot; drew on his experience in discussing displacement, human rights, and dialogue on the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. And Juliet Schofield from International Alert gave the audience an in-depth account of developments related to demography, dependency, and (de-)isolation in South Ossetia. 

The conference concluded with a panel on dialogue and reconciliation. Melanie Garson from UCL discussed the relationship between reconciliation and the durability of peace agreements. Margarita Akhvlediani, Director of Go-Group Media in Tbilisi, drew on her experience in discussing practical observations with respect to reconciliation in the Georgian-Abkhaz context, and Dmitri Gavrilov from the Information Resource Center &amp;quot;Common Home&amp;quot; in Tiraspol talked about his work on reconciliation in the Moldova-Transdniestria context. Michael Walls from UCL gave a presentation about Somaliland, highlighting the role of clan relationships and dialogue. The panel concluded with a discussion of the role of civil society in moving forward the reconciliation process, by Rachel Clogg from Conciliation Resources. 


As stated above, the aim of the conference was to bring together and facilitate discussion among scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers working on and in different de facto states. As such, the conference was a chance to report some of my reserach findings to the potential &amp;quot;users&amp;quot; of this research (in de facto sttaes, as well as NGO practitioners and policy-makers in the UK) and to get their feedback. Many of the conference participants reported that they had found the conference and its comparative perspective useful.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546219e90488e2.00129683</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/spp-news/080914</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Pint of Sience talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6975013C-FA49-4FAD-A1C2-CBE1BE2E4D51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to participate in the &amp;quot;Pint of Science&amp;quot; festival, which aims for scientists and social scientists to engage the wider public through a series of talks in pubs, across the UK.

In terms of academic impact, so far, two published articles have emerged from the project. Both article were published in 2014, in highly ranked and visible journals, and have received attention in form of citations. The article &amp;quot;Help Wanted? The Mixed Record of Foreign Fighters in Domestic Insurgencies&amp;quot; was published International Security, which currently ranks as the no. one journal in International Relations, per the impact factor of World of Science Journal Citation Report. Research on foreign fighters is a growing sub-field. I was invited to be part of panels on foreign fighters for both the 2015 and 2015 annual meeting of the International Studies Association.

The other article, &amp;quot;Convincing State-Builders? Disaggregating Internal Legitimacy in Abkhazia&amp;quot; (with John O'Loughlin, Gerard Toal, and Michael D. Ward) was published in International Studies Quarterly, the flagship journal of the International Studies Association, which is currently ranked as no. 13 in International Relations. The findings speaks to debates on de facto states, post-war state-building, governance, and sovereignty, and in May 2015, I was invited to be part of a workshop on sovereignty at the Weiser Center for Emerging Democracies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

As for policy and societal impact, I have taken concrete steps to disseminate the findings to feed into public debate and engage stakeholders.

In May 2014, in the midst of a growing public and political debate (and worry) about the role of foreign fighters in Syria, I published a piece called &amp;quot;Foreign Fighters Don't Always Help&amp;quot; on the The Washington Post's Monkey Cage, which is a widely read blog. The article, which draws on my research published in International Security, makes the point that although the current debate tends to focus on the danger of foreign fighters returning home, we also need to focus on what these actors do to the struggles they join. In particular, we should worry about whether these actors weaken the rebel movements they come to support-which is likely to have negative implications for conflict intensity, duration, and dynamics. Following up on that, in July 2014, I was invited to give a lunchtime presentation on &amp;quot;Foreign Fighters: The Possible Perils of Helping Hands&amp;quot; to the Strategic Early Warning unit at the Cabinet Office. In a related fashion, in June 2015, I was commissioned to write a report on &amp;quot;Foreign Fighters: Assessing Their Influence at Home and Abroad,&amp;quot; for an Oxford University workshop organized by Prof. Monica Toft, the National Intelligence Council (US), and Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre, Ministry of Defense (UK) for their assessment on future trends.

Drawing on my research findings with respect to war-time and post-war legitimacy, published in the International Studies Quarterly article, I wrote a piece in response to the West's &amp;quot;degrade and destroy&amp;quot; strategy against Islamic State. Published in October 2014, the piece, &amp;quot;Islamic State: No-one Wants to Talk to Terrorists, but We Always Do-and Sometimes it Works&amp;quot; (with Govinda Clayton), was published on the widely read web-based blog The Conversation. One of the key points the article makes is that, in light of Islamic State's state-building efforts, the &amp;quot;degrade and destroy&amp;quot; strategy will work only if it manages to degrade the group's legitimacy as a governing over time been growing attention to Islamic State as not simply a terrorist organization.

Built into my ESRC grant application was finding for a stakeholder conference, which I organized at UCL on September 11 and 12. The conference, &amp;quot;Perceptions of Security and Governance in de facto and Partially Recognized States,&amp;quot; brought together leading scholars, policy-makers, and practitioners working on and in so-called de facto states to discuss questions related to security and governance. The program of the conference was developed in consultation with Conciliation Resources, which is a leading conflict resolution NGO. The aim was to foster an informed debate about how these political entities function and how they are (or are not) prepared for either integration or independent statehood is important. 

The conference was organized around six panels, which addressed questions related to governance, security, the role of third parties, de facto states' relationships to their neighbors and wider international community, displacement and human rights, as well as reconciliation. Each panel featured a mix of researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers, to facilitate discussion among people who are interested in-and knowledgeable about-de facto states from different perspectives. The conference featured speakers working on and in several different de facto states and (post-)conflict situations-Abkhazia, Iraqi Kurdistan, Kosovo, Nagorno Karabakh, Transdniestria, and Somaliland-and with expertise and experience related to governance, peace-building, mediation and conflict management, border changes, demographic changes, human rights, and reconciliation.

The conference began with a discussion about governance, featuring a presentation based on comparative survey evidence from Abkhazia, Nagorno Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Transdniestria, by John O'Loughlin from the University of Colorado and Gerard Toal from Virginia Tech. Liana Kvarcheliya from the Center for Humanitarian Programs, an NGO based in Abkhazia, followed up with an insider perspective on governance in Abkhazia. Donnacha &amp;Oacute; Beach&amp;aacute;in from Dublin City University provided an overview of election dynamics in the post-Soviet de facto states, and Mira Sovakar from Conciliation Resources discussed the nexus between governance and peacebuilding. 

The following panel addressed questions related to security. I made an argument linking governance and security to internal legitimacy in the post-Soviet de facto states. Natella Akaba, Chair of the Public Chamber in Abkhazia, gave a presentation about the war in Abkhazia and its lingering effects, and Tabib Huseynov from the NGO Saferworld discussed the tensions between security concerns and legitimacy in Abkhazia and Nagorno Karabakh. Professor Gareth Stansfield from the University of Exeter talked about the Kurdistan Region in Iraq and the ways in which the recent threat of Islamic State has shaped the Kurdistan de facto state.

Karen Ohanjanyan, Coordinator of the Nagorno-Karabakh Committee &amp;quot;Helsinki Initiative-92,&amp;quot; drew on his experience in discussing displacement, human rights, and dialogue on the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. And Juliet Schofield from International Alert gave the audience an in-depth account of developments related to demography, dependency, and (de-)isolation in South Ossetia. 

The conference concluded with a panel on dialogue and reconciliation. Melanie Garson from UCL discussed the relationship between reconciliation and the durability of peace agreements. Margarita Akhvlediani, Director of Go-Group Media in Tbilisi, drew on her experience in discussing practical observations with respect to reconciliation in the Georgian-Abkhaz context, and Dmitri Gavrilov from the Information Resource Center &amp;quot;Common Home&amp;quot; in Tiraspol talked about his work on reconciliation in the Moldova-Transdniestria context. Michael Walls from UCL gave a presentation about Somaliland, highlighting the role of clan relationships and dialogue. The panel concluded with a discussion of the role of civil society in moving forward the reconciliation process, by Rachel Clogg from Conciliation Resources.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4E535122-D698-4630-9043-A3FA1D7B946A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56375b74b87f47.43681117</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project set out to examine a widespread yet understudied phenomenon that has grave implications for both domestic and international security: the continuation of violence after the fighting in intrastate conflicts officially ends. Peace settlements and military victories are assumed to bring an end to the war, yet they are in some cases followed by high levels of criminal violence and, in other cases, by political violence among former enemies, even among former allies. In the worst case, post-war violence leads to war recurrence, but even continued violence at a level below outright war has adverse effects for the well-being of the population and the post-war societies' capacity to recover. The project hones in on post-war violence in so-called de facto states, also known as unrecognized states. Many of these political entities, typically born out of violent separatist struggles, have proved remarkably enduring, yet we lack systematic knowledge about them. 

Utilizing both survey-based statistical analyses and in-depth case studies, the project has contributed to knowledge about post-war societies, including de facto states, in the following ways:

1. The project has developed a theoretical framework that explains how post-war violence and people's perceptions thereof have implications for the internal legitimacy of post-war states. Internal legitimacy-broadly defined as confidence in the regime, the state, and its institutions-matters for any state's viability. And it is of great importance for the authorities' ability to rule in a post-war setting, particularly when, as in the case of de facto states, the authorities lack international recognition. 

The project has argued that internal legitimacy rests with how convincing the post-war authorities are to their citizens as state-builders. Relying on NSF-funded survey data from the de facto state Abkhazia (Bakke et al. 2014), we find that internal legitimacy is shaped by people's perceptions of the state's ability to provide for their security, which is one of the key features of what it means to be a state. We also find that internal legitimacy is shaped by people's perceptions of public goods provision beyond security, in particular related to economic development and democracy. 

The implications of these findings is that while post-war violence or lack thereof is important in its own right (for citizens' lives and well-being), it also matters for the ability of post-war authorities to create viable political entities. The post-war authorities' ability to be &amp;quot;good &amp;quot; state-builders, also in de facto states, matters for internal legitimacy and political stability-which, in turn, is likely to have repercussions beyond the state's (or de facto state's) borders. 

Along with my co-authors, I am in the process of writing a paper that expands on this already published article by adopting a comparative research design (based on NSF-funded surveys in four de facto states: Abkhazia, Nagorno Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Transdniestria) and including data not only on people's perceptions of post-war violence but also &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; measures of violence based on newspaper reports (Bakke et al. 2014b). 

2. Having established the importance of examining the consequences of post-war violence, the project has also developed a theoretical framework that aims to explain its causes, i.e. why we observe variation in post-war violence. While some post-war states are relatively free from continued violence, some have been the scene of criminal violence, others have seen political violence in the hands of actors challenging the new authorities, and yet others have seen violence in the hands of the authorities. 

The project argues that the post-war order that emerges is shaped by the organization of violence during the war itself. In particular, the project proposes that the post-war violence is shaped by the degree to which the war was fought by actors that were organized as cohesive groups. Empirically, the project examines the transformation from war-time to post-war order through a process-tracing approach that triangulates data from primary and secondary sources, including fieldwork (Bakke 2013), and I am in the process of expanding this part of the analysis to include data from an ESRC-funded survey in Nagorno Karabakh, conducted in fall 2013.
 
This study builds on the growing body of work that has highlighted the importance of understanding the organization of opposition and rebel movements (in particular, whether they are cohesive or fragmented), and it drives this research forward by arguing that war-time organization has implications also for the post-war order.

3. Neither the war-time organization nor the post-war order is the result of domestic factors only, and one of the new questions explored in this project, which was not initially anticipated, relates to the role of foreign fighters.

The international policy community is concerned about foreign fighters for a number of reasons. Western governments worry that by participating in wars abroad, foreign fighters will radicalize and gain skills they can put to use back home. Another worry, shared with governments of states fighting insurgencies within their borders, is that foreign fighters bring along manpower, weapons, know-how and (access to) financial resources, all of which may strengthen the domestic rebels and potentially prolong and spread the war. Yet, as we have come to see in Syria, the domestic rebels and population may grow sceptical of their foreign helpers. 

Indeed, as I argue and show in the context of Chechnya (Bakke 2014), which functioned as a de facto states from 1996 to 1999, it is not a given that foreign fighters strengthen the domestic rebel movement they join. While foreign fighters may strengthen a domestic rebel movement by boosting its coercive force through added resources and expertise, they can also weaken the movement's organizational cohesion and ability to mobilize supporters by introducing new ideas about goals and tactics. The entry of new goals and tactics can directly lead to movement divisions-even outright defection-if local resistance leaders are not on board. The introduction of new goals and tactics can also lead to difficulty for the movement leaders in garnering public support. In the Chechen context, these effects of foreign fighter influence proved detrimental to the ability of the de facto state's authorities to rule the republic. 

Not only do these findings give impetus to further study of the relationship between war-time organization and post-war order; it also highlights the fruitfulness of integrating two trends in the research program on violent conflicts in the last few years: the turn towards focusing on the transnational aspects of domestic struggles and the turn towards examining micro dynamics and intra-group relations.

First and foremost, it highlights the importance of systematically examining post-war violence and order, and more comparative research is needed. The empirics in this study focus on so-called de facto states, which have long been black boxes for systematic empirical research, but the arguments and findings speak to post-war states in general. Future research can examine the arguments developed in this project also in the context of recognized (i.e. not de facto) post-war states. There is a growing body of work on post-war states and societies, increasingly utilizing both surveys and fieldwork. Conducting research in these settings is both expensive and challenging (for example, I could not go to South Ossetia for logistical and security-related concerns), but the importance of systematically understanding how post-war states to (and do not function) and the determinants for the variation we observe, should hopefully give impetus for research councils to further this kind of research. Indeed, given the discussions at the stakeholder conference I organized at the end of the grant period, this kind of research would be welcomed by both state and non-state actors working with conflict resolution, post-war societies, and de facto states. 

The findings in this project should also give impetus to further comparative research exploring the long-term consequences of war-time organization. In the last few years, a number of studies have highlighted how the organization of armed groups and opposition movements (in particular, whether they are fragmented and cohesive) shape war-time violence, mediation, and bargaining outcomes, but we know much less about the longer-term effects on the post-war order. 

Though the study initially set out to focus on domestic dynamics, it came to shed light on the importance of considering the transnational and international actors that may shape both war-time organization and the post-war order. While, in this project, I have examined the influence of foreign fighters on rebel movement strength in the case of Chechnya, further research might want to do so in a comparative context. Again, this is a challenging endeavor given data limitations, but as policy concerns with respect to a number of ongoing conflicts (such as Syria and Iraq) should attest to, this is research with clear policy implications. Further research might also want to explore how other external actors-patron states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations-influence post-war states' (including de facto states') state-building capacities. This kind of research is of interest to the scholarly community, but of great interest to policy-makers and other stakeholder working on, in, and with post-war and de facto states.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3568445D-5A92-4EF3-9F1B-5B20C41EA583</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54a2a765103c74.41538173</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>As part of my ESRC-grant &amp;quot;After the War Ends,&amp;quot; I designed and commissioned, in September 2013, a public opinion survey in the de facto state Nagorno Karabakh.
