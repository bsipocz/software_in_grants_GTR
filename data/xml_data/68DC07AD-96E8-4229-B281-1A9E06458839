According to a recent study, workers in the United Kingdom suffer high levels of depression than those anywhere else in Europe. The survey found that 1 in 10 employees had taken time off at some point in their working lives because of depression problems. Novel strategies for tackling the problem of depression and preventing suicides are needed. We believe that new emerging technologies, in particular mobile ones, together with the possibility of mining large amount of data in real-time can help to tackle this problem in new and more effective ways. 

Existing interview-based studies have shown that depression is significantly associated with a marked decline of physical activity. The goal of this project is to investigate how mobile phones can be used to collect and analyse mobility patterns of individuals in order to understand how mental health problems affect their daily routines and behaviour and how potential changes can be automatically detected. In particular, mobility patterns and levels of activity can be quantitatively measured by means of mobile phones, exploiting the GPS receiver and the accelerometers embedded in the devices. The data can be extremely helpful to understand the behaviour of a depressed person, and in particular, to detect potential changes in his or her behaviour, which might be linked to a worsening depressive state. By monitoring this information in real-time, health officers and charity workers might intervene by means of digital behaviour intervention delivered through mobile phones or by means of traditional methods such as by inviting the person for a meeting or by calling him or her by phone.

In order to support these novel applications, it is necessary to build mathematical tools for analysing the mobility traces in real-time for the detection of gradual or sudden changes related to the emotional states of the individual. More specifically, we plan to devise analytical techniques for studying the relationships between human mobility patterns and emotional states. We plan to use existing datasets of human mobility and to collect data by means of a smartphone application distributed to people affected by depression. This can be considered as a sort of pilot study for a wider deployment of these technologies and it will provide a sound theoretical basis for further studies in this area. Finally, a key aspect of the proposed research work is the implementation of mechanisms for preserving the privacy of the individuals involved in the study.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We believe that the proposed research programme can have a significant societal impact. Indeed, depression is a major issue in the United Kingdom and has profound psychological, social, and economic implications for individuals, families and communities. The long-term impact will be in novel methods of intervention and support, based on the outputs of the proposed work. Indeed the analytical techniques investigated in &amp;quot;Trajectories of Depression&amp;quot; can be used as a basis for novel systems for providing real-time support to individuals when they really need it without a direct interaction with health officers. By doing so, individuals that are not collaborative because of their condition can also receive prompt help and attention in order to prevent a worsening of their condition and, in some cases, suicide attempts. Moreover, the techniques can also be used to concentrate resources on individuals that really need help at a certain point in time. To summarise, the project can really lead to the improvement of the well-being of thousands of individuals and it will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of delivery of Social Welfare services.

It is worth noting that Dr. Paul Patterson, Public Health Research Programme Manager at Youthspace, Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust is a member of the Advisory Committee and will help to steer the project in directions that will provide a direct benefit to the communities in the coming years. Dr. Patterson and the colleagues at the Stirling Suicidal Behaviour Research Laboratory will also help in establishing links to charities that are active in this area (such as Mind and The Samaritans).

Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of this work, the proposed research programme will benefit various communities in Computer Science, Health Sciences and Psychology. As far as Computer Science is concerned, we believe that the project will lead to novel insights and contributions in different areas including Ubiquitous Computing, Data Mining, Systems, and, potentially Security as discussed in the &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; section. With respect to Health Sciences and Psychology, for the first time, researchers will have the possibility of accessing quantitative data to validate theories and models that have been evaluated only by means of qualitative information, such as interviews. This can really lead to a step change in studying depression, especially in terms of its evolution over time and its impact on the daily life of individuals. It will provide new ways for providing direct help to them, for example through Digital Behaviour Change Interventions through mobile phones.

We are also planning an outreach programme for disseminating the finding of the project among young people. Activities in schools might also be an occasion for discussing issues related to depression and suicides in collaborations with charities working on these themes. The project will benefit from the fact that the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham is heavily involved in the Computing at Schools initiative. We also plan an exhibit at the Thinkthank Science Museum in Birmingham. We plan to engage with students in our Undergraduate and Master programmes by offering for example guest lectures on topics related to the project, discussing the use of mobile technology and large-scale data mining.

Finally, we believe that the outputs of this project can potentially be translated into commercial products in the future. We plan to work closely with NEC, our industrial project partner, in order to explore uses of the findings of &amp;quot;Trajectories of Depression&amp;quot;. The company has also expressed a strong interest in the computational aspects of the project, since it provides an interesting application scenario for investigating issues related to large-scale real-time processing and mining of personal data, in particular in the healthcare sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>94820</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Prof. Rory O'Connor</gtr:description><gtr:id>AFC9E5DA-AFFE-464B-A378-5842500496BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Current output: MoodTraces app.

The application is now available for download on the GooglePlay website: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nsds.moodtraces&amp;amp;hl=en_GB

We have also interacted with Prof. Rory O'Connor at the University of Glasgow and Dr. Paul Patterson for the definition of the questionnaires used in the data collection application.

We have then deployed the app and we have collected data from 28 users. We have defined a set of mobility metrics that can be extracted from the mobility traces of the users and, using the ground truth data collected by means of the Android application, we have identified a significant correlation between the changes of such metrics and the variations in the PHQ score. Such a correlation ranges from 0.336 to 0.432 when the mobility metrics are computed over a period of 14 days. Third, we have trained and evaluated personalised and general machine learning models to predict PHQ score changes from mobility metrics variations, obtaining very good prediction accuracies. For example, when the mobility metrics are computed over a period of 14 days, the general model achieves sensitivity and specificity values of 0.74 and 0.78 (respectively), whereas the average sensitivity and specificity values of the personalized models are 0.71 and 0.87 (respectively).

Finally, we have identified some interesting research questions related to causality and analysis of mobility traces, which was not presented in the original grant proposal. The causality versus correlation question is indeed a fundamental aspect of the proposed research work. In fact, if we are able to detect causality in the traces, we might be able to infer a set of potential causes of depressive states, which might be very helpful for researchers and health officers.

In order to study the presence of a correlation between the mobility traces and the emotional state of an individual, we have carried out a preliminary study exploiting the StudentLife dataset, collected from a single class of 48 students during a 10 weeks term at Dartmouth College using Android phones. StudentLife includes information about locations, stress and depression levels for each participant. Location data are collected at periodic time interval exploiting phone sensors (e.g., GPS and WiFi), stress levels are inferred from the answers to the surveys that are periodically administered to the participants by phone, whereas depression levels are obtained from the answers to the surveys that are administered only at the start and end of the term. Exploiting this information, we performed a preliminary study to understand the correlation between mobility traces and stress levels of individuals. The goal of this study is to determine whether it is possible to derive some features from the mobility trace of an individual (e.g., total distance covered, coverage area, etc.) that can tell something about the stress level of that individual. First of all, we pre-processed the location data of each student using a clustering approach in order to identify when the student was moving and when he/she was still in a significant place. For each stress report, we used the obtained mobility traces to derive some mobility metrics associated to a time interval of some hours that precedes the stress report. We considered the following mobility metrics associated to that time interval: total distance covered, gyration (a coverage measure), and variance of the movements from one place to another.

Our preliminary study shows that there is a correlation between the considered mobility metrics and the stress reports. When we consider the whole population of students, this correlation is not very strong. However, if we limit our study to the population of students experiencing a moderate or severe depression, such a correlation becomes significant. We consider other types of population obtained by clustering the users with respect to their personality - indeed StudentLife contains also the answers to standard surveys that are used for personality evaluation. The results show that for some personality traits the correlation between the considered mobility metrics and the stress levels is rather high.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We believe that the proposed work can have a considerable societal impact, because it might lead to novel and more effective ways of providing prompt support and behaviour interventions for dealing with depression and preventing suicides. The impact will also be economic, given the non-negligible loss of productivity due to depression in the UK and the cost of providing medical and psychological help to patients. 

With respect to the academic impact, we believe that the outputs in the area of data mining of mobility traces might be of strong interest for both computer scientists and social scientists, especially with respect to the techniques for extracting causality relationships from the data.

We are now in discussion with Takeda, a pharmaceutical company for random control trials of this technology.

We have also been approached by colleagues in other Universities to carry out further studies related to the use of mobile technology for monitoring and predicting mental health problems. In particular, we have been in contact with colleagues at KCL and UCL for the study of depression and schizophrenia. One of these collaborations is now ongoing with Prof. Richard Dobson (KCL/UCL Farr Institute) through a partnership at the Alan Turing Institute. This collaboration is funded by Intel, one of the industrial partners of the Turing.

In general, we believe that the metrics developed in this project can be used and improved by researchers around the world and they represent a novel contribution to the state of the art.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5D36C54F-5FBC-40A8-B1E5-07D42322159F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54623e2b165917.86717807</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/tod/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>MoodTraces is an energy-efficient Android application for smartphones (not tablets!), developed by researchers at the University of Birmingham, which periodically samples location, activity, application usage, and answers to questionnaires.
