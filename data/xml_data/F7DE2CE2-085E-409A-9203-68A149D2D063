With the development of modern life, more and more devices will appear in our home and office, and the trouble of fiddling with all these wires will eventually become intolerable. Wireless communication provides an attractive solution, owing to its unique mobility. Current wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth , have already enabled us to enjoy the unprecedented convenience of using internet, keyboard, headset, and other devices wirelessly. There are more wireless applications, such as digital imaging and video streaming, where a much higher data rate is needed. Ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) is an ultimate way of unwiring our life. By using an extremely large bandwidth spanning several gigahertzes, UWB provides short-range wireless interconnections with data rates of up to several gigabits per second, high enough to replace most cables in current home and office devices. In 2002, the Federal Communications Commission approved deployment of UWB in the United States. In a study conducted by Mason Communications and DotEcon for the Office of Communications, it is estimated that UWB can generate a net value of more than 6 billion pounds for the economy of the United Kingdom by 2020 under a European regulation. The above applications of UWB focus on achieving an extremely high data rate using the ultra-wide bandwidth. In other applications, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and wireless body area networks (WBANs), where power consumption is more important than data rate, UWB has also been explored to achieve extremely low power consumption at a low data rate. WSNs are used in surveillance and disaster area monitoring to improve public safety and increase environmental awareness. WBANs are used in hearing aids and health monitoring to diagnose disease and save life. Battery life is a key factor to both WSNs and WBANs. UWB device operates at an ultra-low power thousands or even tens of thousands times smaller than conventional wireless devices and is very suitable for WSNs and WBANs. The commercial use of UWB technology was proposed only nine years ago, and its regulation was passed only five years ago. Owing to its huge market value, UWB has attracted great research interest from both universities and industries in recent years. Much of this research focuses on designs of transmitters and receivers for UWB systems. In applications where high data rate is desired, Rake receivers have been widely used to achieve superior performances at the cost of a complex structure. Rake receivers require signal timing information, which is provided by synchronization. In the literature, a two-dimensional search for symbol timing offset and frame timing offset was implemented for synchronization. This search was also simplified to two suboptimal one-dimensional searches. The effect of synchronization errors on performances of Rake receivers was evaluated. Also, in applications where low power consumption is desired, transmit-reference receivers and energy detection receivers have been frequently adopted to achieve reasonably good performances with a simple structure. In this document, an integrated research program involving three related topics for investigation and the training of three research students is proposed. The research program aims to design new UWB synchronizers that achieve synchronization within a much shorter period of time than previous synchronizers to increase system efficiency and reduce implementation cost, to design new UWB transmit-reference receivers with improved performance that provide higher quality of service using less system resources than previous receivers, and to analyze UWB Rake and transmit-reference receivers with synchronization errors using more important performance measures than previous analyses and to optimize previous receivers based on these new analyses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>211628</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) has attracted great research interest in recent years, owing to its huge market in both low data-rate applications, such as wireless sensor, and high data-rate applications, such as wireless monitor. It is reaching every aspect of our life in health care, digital ecomony, defense and consumer electronics and more to provide convenience and to save cost. In all these applications, the key function of the UWB system is to transmit and receive the data reliably through a very challenging radio channel. This project has focused on the designs of receivers for UWB systems and the relevant techniques, such as relaying to extend its range, cognitive radio to provide backup and chaotic sequence to provide large capacity. There are three main receivers used in UWB systems: the Rake receiver, the transmitted-reference receiver and the energy detection receiver. This project has derived new theoretical results that further the understanding of these receivers and has developed new receiver designs that outperform existing ones. Thus, contributions to scientific knowledge as well as contributions to practical system designs are achieved.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>People work in this area will cite the
