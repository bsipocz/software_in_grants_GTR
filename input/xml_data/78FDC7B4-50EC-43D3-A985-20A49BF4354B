Growing body of evidence suggests that these cells can give rise to various other cell types. In example studies have demonstrated that shortly after birth pericytes can give rise to skeletal muscle cells. For yet unknown reasons their capacity to develop into muscle cells diminishes in ageing. The tentative stemness properties of pericytes make them an attractive target to treat muscular dystrophies as well as other muscle diseases and injuries. About 1 in 3500 boys is born with muscular dystrophy in Europe. The disease leads to gradual death of skeletal muscle cells, progressive muscle weakness, and is associated with severely shortened life expectancy. There is no cure available to treat this disease. Previous studies with dystrophic mice and dogs have shown that pericyte-derived cells can successfully repair skeletal muscles upon injection into blood circulation. The cells leave blood vessels and target the inflamed muscle, where they will give rise to muscle cells. However, the process remains relatively ineffective. Considering that pericytes are abundant along most blood vessels it might be possible to instruct them to differentiate into beneficial skeletal muscle cells directly, without the need for cell isolation and injection. Yet, for this aim it is important to gain a detailed understanding of how pericyte fate is regulated. This is because in addition to potentially beneficial cell types pericytes may also give rise to myofibroblasts. In muscular dystrophies myofibroblasts accumulate between skeletal muscle cells and secrete various proteins that increase muscle stiffness and thereby prevent the healing process. Thus, in order to fully harness the regenerative potential of pericytes we would need to limit their negative contribution in muscular dystrophy.
 I will study mouse embryonic development and adult skeletal muscles to show cells that can arise from pericytes. I will thereafter characterise the molecules that can guide pericytes to give rise to one or another cell type with an emphasis on finding ways how to influence pericytes to develop into skeletal muscle cells. This part of the project will rely on expert knowledge on cell microenvironment in Manchester and will make use of automated cell analysis techniques that can indicate possible pharmaceutical targets to manipulate pericyte fate. Finally, I will demonstrate why skeletal muscle pericytes lose their beneficial potential to contribute to skeletal muscle cells in ageing and whether it can be reversed. This study will for the first time address the stemness properties of pericytes throughout embryonic development and in tissue context in adults and will provide extensive novel information that can be used in regenerative medicine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Pericytes have well defines and specialised functions around blood vessels, including guiding blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) and regulating blood flow (vasoconstriction). Accumulating evidence shows that pericytes can leave their blood vessel associated niche and differentiate into other cell types. The pericyte progeny is poorly characterised due to the lack of truly specific markers. I will here take an innovative approach that makes use of a novel transgenic mouse line in which pericytes expressing two marker genes simultaneously will be labelled with red fluorescence and their progeny will be permanently marked by green fluorescent protein expression. Existing mouse models that allow specific tracking of adult skeletal muscle pericytes will complement the study. Using these methods I will for the first time map the fate of pericytes throughout embryonic development and in adult skeletal muscles. I will identify cell microenvironment conditions and signalling molecules that regulate pericyte differentiation into skeletal muscle cells. I will combine the fate mapping experiments and signalling pathway studies with direct imaging of pericyte differentiation in order to visualise their commitment into skeletal muscle cells and establish the possibilities of manipulating with pericyte plasticity. I will address the loss of pericyte myogenic potential in ageing and dissect the relative contribution of the aged tissue microenvironment to this change. I will show whether by exposing adult skeletal muscle pericytes to specific signals their regenerative potential can be reversed. The novel data on pericyte plasticity and lineage determination will be important in understanding the possible use of these cells in tissue regeneration.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic Impact. The proposed research will have a direct and immediate impact on biomedical research. The novel mouse model established in this work will be valuable in a wide number of research areas related to vascular biology, including cancer research, neurobiology and studies of cardiac diseases. Understanding the role of pericytes in regulating blood vessel development and function in these areas is of immense medical significance, but lack of suitable mouse models has hindered progress. In addition to pericytes, several other cell types lack known specific marker genes. The novel approach to visualise pericytes by a double-transgenic approach will pave the way to implementing a similar method to study other cell types that suffer from this limitation. The databases on signalling pathways and cell microenvironment conditions that enhance pericyte differentiation will benefit researchers focusing on cell differentiation. Knowledge of possibly simple combinations of cell microenvironment components that guide cell fate will make it possible to apply the results in stem cell studies. I will present the results at high-level international conferences to facilitate collaboration and aim to published my work in leading journals.

Societal impact. The outcome of the work will benefit muscular dystrophy patients. Various forms of dystrophy are very common (i.e. 1 in 3500 boys is born with Duchenne dystrophy), yet there is no cure available. Current cell and gene therapy has shown only limited efficacy in improving patient's life. Pericytes are capable of differentiating into skeletal muscle cells, but unfortunately in dystrophic muscle may also give rise to myofibroblasts and enhance tissue fibrosis. By identifying signals that regulate pericyte fate these cells can be either directly targeted in the patient (if signalling pathways are highly specific) or isolated and activated in vitro before transferring them back to the patient. The potential benefit of this research is not limited to congenital dystrophies. There are significant socio-economical implications for the ageing of Western European population. Increased muscle weakness (age related atrophy) causes reduced mobility and leads to lower quality of life. My project targets the diminished myogenic potential of perivascular cells in ageing and will demonstrate whether this can be reversed. If we knew how to activate and drive pericytes towards skeletal muscle fate we could use this to target age related muscle weakness, in particular in patients suffering from various diseases (i.e. cancer), but also in case of acute skeletal muscle injuries in young adults.
 
Economic impact. I will identify pathways and molecules that regulate pericyte differentiation towards beneficial myogenic regenerative fate. These compounds can be combined to pharmaceuticals to target skeletal muscle diseases. The power of high throughput screening of chemical modulators by pharmaceutical industries can further narrow down the molecular pathways to achieve a cell-type specific effect. It is possible though that suitable safe drugs already exist but have not been tested for skeletal muscle repair, in which case there will be an immediate medical impact on patient care. The wider economic impact is based on increasing the mobility of patients suffering from muscle diseases but also from age related muscle weakness, thereby reducing their dependence on care services.
 
Educational/Public impact. In this study I will address one of the fundamental questions in developmental biology on the differentiation plasticity of cells. Pericytes have clearly well defined functional properties around blood vessels, but can give rise to cell types with very different roles, like the contractile skeletal muscle cells. Such an intriguing phenomenon is of interest to students of biology and to wider audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>295137</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU Munich)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Characterisation of pericyte fate in the central nervous system</gtr:description><gtr:id>A802C4F4-E1D1-4728-80AD-58F552B630EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is still underway and direct outputs are expected in the next two years.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d48fdb76f2e6.70888689-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr. Marisa Karow is expert in the central nervous system pericytes and stem cells and leads the efforts to characterize the fate of pericytes in the nervous system.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have carried out extensive experiments to label mouse pericytes and their daughter cells.

Cell culture experiments and limited animal studies revealed their potency to give rise to other cell types. Lack of specific marker genes and thus suitable animal models has prevented to fully characterise pericyte fate in diverse organs. The key aim of my fellowship was to establish a transgenic mouse model that would enable specific labeling of CD146+NG2+ perivascular cells and identifying their differentiation potential throughout mouse life (from early embryonic development to adults). I have succeeded in generating the transgenic mouse model in which CD146+NG2+ perivascular cells are labelled by simultaneous expression of red and green fluorescent protein expression. As these cells differentiate they lose the expression of the red fluorescent protein but maintain the green fluorescent protein expression that is maintained throughout the subsequent cell generations. 

This novel mouse model enables me to study the extent in which pericytes contribute to tissue growth. I have carried out in depth characterization of the new transgenic line and demonstrated its suitability for studying perivascular cells in diverse mouse organs. By analyzing pericyte gene expression I found that CD146+NG2+ cells represent a unique vascular cell type and differ from various progenitor and stem cells that are present in diverse organs. I found that in the early development of the aorta vascular smooth muscle progenitor cells are marked by CD146+NG2+ expression. These cells proliferate rapidly to give rise to most of the aortic smooth muscle cells. However, already by fetal stage the frequency of CD146+NG2+ cells decreases. Still, even in mature arteries a minor population of CD146+NG2+ cells is maintained as a potential reserve progenitor cell pool that may be used in repairing vascular injuries.

The hereby generated transgenic line will open up new opportunities to study the fate of perivascular cells in mouse models of human diseases. It has been proposed that in addition to participating in tissue regeneration, pericytes can contribute to fibrosis and hamper the repair process. To maximize the potential use of this mouse model I have and am still establishing collaborations to study different disease models. Together with my work in healthy mice this collaborative network will establish the true plasticity of pericytes and can open up new possibilities in targeting these cells in regenerative medicine.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In accordance with the aims of achieving the proposed &amp;quot;Academic Impact&amp;quot; I presented my work at the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Stem Cell Biology meeting in October, 2015. Subsequently I was offered the possibility to talk of this project at the International Society of Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Conference in 2016. I presented the data also at the Society of Developmental Biology annual meeting in 2016. These meetings have provided me with necessary feedback and have enabled to start preliminary collaboration projects. The major results of the fellowship are currently prepared for publication. These peer-reviewed publications will prove the suitability of the novel transgenic model and will aid in applying for funding for large-scale collaborative research projects. 
The achievement of the societal and economic impact will depend on the results of the proposed experiments that still need to be validated and published. I am involved as a collaborator in Wellcome Trust funded clinical trial on using mesoangioblasts (in vitro cultured skeletal muscle pericytes) in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This has introduced me to a network of leading experts in the field of muscular dystrophy that can help in translating promising results from the current fellowship into future clinical trials.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F89D4F83-9D1D-43C0-81AF-2F11871170D1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56924cf1d91072.46272343</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>CD146 (MCAM - melanoma cell adhesion molecule) is widely expressed in developing tissues and in metastatic tumor cells.

Pericytes, like many other cell types, lack a unique marker gene. This makes their labeling in mouse tissues and the characterisation of their fate impossible. We have developed a novel strategy whereby one pericyte marker gene drives CRE recombinase, which activates the expression of flippase recombinase and red fluorescent protein under the control of a second pericyte marker gene. In this manner, only cells that are positive for both of the marker genes are labelled by red fluorescent protein, and not cells that express either one or the other gene separately. This approach enables specific labelling of pericytes, and by crossing to a third mouse model, the flippase reporter strain, all the daughter cells of flippase expressing cells will permanently express green fluorescent protein. This is the first pericyte-specific mouse model that we expect to be of wide general use in vascular and stem cell biology. In addition, the developed method proves the feasibility of labeling cell types that so far have been difficult to study due to the lack of a single unique marker gene. We will distribute the DNA constructs for the generation of additional mouse lines for CRE inducible expression of flippase and red fluorescent protein.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9A05DF98-D31C-4786-82BE-477F40E5916B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We will submit the description of the developed method for publication in 2016.
