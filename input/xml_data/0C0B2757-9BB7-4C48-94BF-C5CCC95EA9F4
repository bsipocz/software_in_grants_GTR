Opportunities include fully funded PhD Scholarships, CASE Awards that facilitate links with new industrial partners, Doctoral Prizes to allow the continued development of PhD research, and Vacation Bursaries that permit undergraduate students to participate in small scale scientific research projects. 
Over recent years, the EPSRC DTP has had impact on a broad range of subjects:
 Fully funded PhD Scholarships have been awarded to the departments of Physics, Mathematics and Statistics, Computing and Communications and Chemistry
 CASE Awards have been made to students based in Physics, Engineering, Mathematics and Statistics and Computing and Communications
 Doctoral Prizes have been awarded to develop research in Computing and Communications and Physics
 Vacation Bursaries have been awarded for projects in Physics, Computing and Communications, Chemistry and Psychology and the Lancaster Environment Centre
The allocation of EPSRC DTP funds has also been aligned with the strategic development of research centres and institutes at Lancaster University, which includes the Data Science Institute and the Material Science Institute. Both institutes seek to strengthen the University's commitment to interdisciplinary thinking in a way unique to the UK context.
EPSRC funded students are part of the Science and Technology Graduate School and the wider postgraduate research community at Lancaster. Details of the Graduate School can be found at http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/postgraduate/. 
Faculty based research training for PhD students and indeed training across the University is aligned to Vitae's Researcher Development Framework. The Graduate School Research Training programme is designed to enhance research skills and capacity, providing PhD students with vital transferable skills, whilst also bringing together students within the Faculty to discuss their research. For further information regarding the Research Training on offer within the Science and Technology Graduate School see http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/postgraduate/postgraduate-research/graduate-school-research-training/. 
All PhD students are encouraged to complete a Development Needs Analysis when they arrive at Lancaster, to help identify their specific training needs. There is also in place a schedule of appraisals by which the progress and development of all PhD students is monitored. Appraisals take place at regular, 6 monthly intervals where progress is discussed and requirements for future development are identified.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1754202</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509504/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
