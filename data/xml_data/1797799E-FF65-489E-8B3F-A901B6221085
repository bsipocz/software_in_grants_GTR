Ozone data produced by the operational system from MetOp are of insufficient quality in the troposphere for the Air Quality forecasting applications being developed within the GMES/Copernicus MACC-II framework, Met.Office or other operational centres. The RAL Remote Sensing Group's algorithm [Munro, 1998] has been developed through NERC/NCEO to produce tropospheric ozone data from MetOp's uv-nadir spectrometer GOME-2 which substantially exceeds the quality provided of the standard operational products. This has led to the inclusion of the RAL scheme in the ESA Climate Change Initiative (Essential Climate Variables) Ozone project and to request for operational data provision. Further improvements to tropospheric quality is achieved by adding (via joint retrieval) information from the thermal infra-red sounder IASI. Similarly, the Group's IASI methane scheme developed in NERC/NCEO is unique in delivering global height resolved information on this critical greenhouse gas. This methane processor is to be used in the NERC consortium grant GAUGE.

Due to the large data volumes and CPU requirements, combined with the time-critical acquisition of auxiliary data, real time processing of the MetOp data with RAL's schemes has not been viable. Looking ahead to CEMS, the resource required for dedicated NRT processing cannot be guaranteed due to the sharing of this resource with many other users 

The resource requested here will make use of the existing CEMS-academic infrastructure, data and management, but will provide the essential, dedicated minimum number of cores to enable delivery of the Near Real Time products.

In the case of ozone, our partners provide total columns, stratospheric profiles from limb-sounders or height-resolved data from ir nadir sounders whose height-sensitivity differs from that of the uv nadir sounders for which we are responsible. In the case of aerosol, our partners provide stratospheric profiles from limb sounders, optical properties from ir nadir sounders to augment particle size and type information from vis/near-ir wavelengths for which we are responsible, or else aerosol optical depth and other properties from vis/near-ir sensors with which to compare to ours.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Based on schemes for height-resolved ozone and aerosol retrieval developed through NERC NCEO and applied extensively in ESA's Climate Change Initiative (C3S), our team has involvement in the first phase of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, led by ECMWF.
