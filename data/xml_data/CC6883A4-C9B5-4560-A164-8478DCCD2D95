The FAO has ranked potato as the world's third most important food crop based on its high yield, nutritional value and less stringent requirements for irrigation and arable land to grow compared with many crops. However, there is an urgent need for the development of new varieties with genetically improved agronomic performance, particularly adaptability to harsh cultivation environments such as low rainfall and temperature, resistance to disease, and high tuber yield and quality. A major challenge is posed by the polyploid nature of the potato genome. Polyploid organisms have multiple sets of chromosomes per cell. When polyploid cells divide, they show much more complicated chromosome pairing behaviour compared to diploid cells with two sets of chromosomes, creating a wider range of outcomes for recombination (gene shuffling) and gene segregation (partitioning). Polyploidy has played a key role in the evolution of plants and animals, particularly flowering plants, many of which are currently polyploid, while the rest have experienced polyploidy in their evolutionary history. Potato is an autotetraploid with four copies of the same genome and shows tetrasomic inheritance, a characteristic shared by many other important crops including leek, sugarcane, alfalfa and some economically important aquaculture species, including Atlantic salmon and trout. 

To develop new potato varieties with genetically improved performance requires knowledge of the number and location of genes that affect the target traits. Most observable traits in nature are quantitative or complex, including key agronomic traits, such as yield and resistance to disease, as well as most traits relevant to health and disease, in humans and other animals. Therefore understanding how phenotypic variation in quantitative traits is genetically controlled provides an essential and rational basis for plant breeding. Discovery of abundant DNA sequence variants in the genome of most species provides a source of information for locating genes that underlie quantitative trait phenotypes, the so called mapping of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). QTL mapping provides estimates of genome locations, the number and effects of the genes controlling a quantitative trait. Theory and methods for QTL mapping have been well established and QTL mapping is routinely practiced in diploid species. However, the same type of study lags far behind in autotetraploid species, primarily due to the lack of appropriate methods for these analyses. Since inheritance in autotetraploids differs markedly from that in diploids, it is inappropriate to use the methods developed for diploids to conduct the same analysis in autotetraploids. 

This project will deliver the scientific basis and novel analytical tools for DNA-marker assisted mapping of QTL and other quantitative genetic analyses in autotetraploid species. The methods to be developed will take proper account of the essential yet complex features of autotetraploid inheritance. We will carry out experiments to sequence an outbred segregating population of cultivated potato for evenly distributed DNA sequence variants in the potato genome. The sequence data will be integrated with phenotype data of several agronomically important quantitative traits from the same population to enable mapping of QTL for these traits using the analytical methods to be developed. This will provide the first example of QTL mapping practice on a rigorous tetrasomic basis. Accomplishment of this project will open unprecedented opportunities for basic genetics and genomics research in autotetraploid species, and facilitate genetic breeding for elite autotetraploid crop cultivars and aquaculture animal varieties.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Dissecting the genetic variation of quantitative traits into chromosomal regions (Quantitative Trait Loci, QTL) is an effective first step for unveiling the molecular architecture governing quantitative genetic variation and the mechanisms maintaining such variation in nature. In one of many potential applications, QTL mapping provides breeders with map information of agronomic quantitative traits for performing marker assisted selection and thereby significantly enhancing breeding efficiency. Theory and methods for QTL mapping have been well established for diploid species and QTL mapping is now routinely practised in almost all diploid species, including plants, animals, and humans. However, the same kind of study is rare, if not non-existent, in autotetraploid species, primarily due to the lack of appropriate methods for conducting the relevant quantitative genetic analyses. Although efforts have recently been made to develop such methods, none of them can be used to model and analyse data from QTL mapping experiments with autotetraploid species on a rigorous scientific basis.

In the proposed project, we will develop novel theoretical models on a strict tetrasomic basis and statistically appropriate methods for marker assisted mapping of QTL in outbred segregating populations of autotetraploid species. These methods will take full account of all essential features of tetrasomic inheritance in gene segregation and recombination. We will apply these methods to map the genetic basis of a series of 29 agronomic traits, including flowering time, tuber yield and quality etc., in a potato segregating population. The population consists of 351 individuals created by crossing two autotetraploid cultivars divergent for a series of agronomic and morphological quantitative traits. We will carry out optimized RAD-sequencing in this population to identify genome-wide genetic markers and integrate this data with phenotype data we have collected for QTL mapping analysis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>To feed the rapidly expanding human population, we are currently facing a serious need to boost agricultural production. This challenge urges the development of a multifaceted approach to developing new crop varieties with enhanced characteristics. Genetic modification will undoubtedly have its role to play, but for the most part, this will depend on traditional, genomically informed plant breeding. To develop new cultivars with enhanced performance for complex agronomic traits such as yield or disease resistance requires knowledge of the number of genes affecting the trait, their actions and interactions, and their genome locations. 

Our work will benefit geneticists and breeders by delivering new methods and analytical tools to enable the genes underlying complex quantitative traits (QTL) to be appropriately dissected in autotetraploid species. This group includes many of the most important crops including cultivated potato, the world's third most important food crop, leek, sugarcane, alfalfa and some economically important aquaculture species, including Atlantic salmon and trout. Application of these new methods and tools will facilitate the marker assisted selection of agronomic traits in such species, thereby improving the efficiency of breeding for elite autotetraploid varieties. It also opens unprecedented opportunities for basic genetics and genomics research in autotetraploid species. This project is therefore perfectly aligned to the first BBSRC strategic priority of agriculture and food security. 

The global food security challenge is further intensified by climate change and urbanization. For example, yields of our most important food crops decline seriously because of climate driven shrinkage of their cultivation area. There is therefore an urgent need to develop a new generation of crops tolerant of diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. Potato may be grown with less stringent requirements for environmental conditions than other food crops such as rice or wheat, and thus it is an increasingly important crop for coping with climate change. The experimental data, materials and analytical methods to be generated in this project will contribute an informative guide for crop, particularly potato, breeding. This makes a valuable contribution to the BBSRC strategic priority of &amp;quot;generating crops adapted to the challenges of future environments.&amp;quot; 

The proposed work will help to fulfill the BBSRC aim of providing skilled researchers for academic research in quantitative biology, specifically statistical genetics, by generating an opportunity for PhD projects and training the RA with both experimental skills (e.g. NGS) and analytical skills for handling sophisticated biological datasets. Skills in computer programming and algorithm development are becoming increasingly important in bioscience, which has experienced huge increases in the scale of data produced in genome projects. These skills will therefore provide a solid basis for future research success in almost any field of modern biology. Moreover, support to the project will benefit the UK scientists' international leading role in the field of autotetraploid genetics and genomics, and thus contribute to the wider economy and to society.

We will continue our active involvement with the potato industry and breeding institutes, including PepsiCo (USA) and the Qinghai Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences (China). We are also committed to reaching the wider community of plant breeders and businesses, e.g. through various outreach activities at NIAB Innovation Farm. We will also incorporate our work into teaching of the Masters courses (e.g. MSc Molecular Biotechnology) at the University of Birmingham, to attract the interest of UK and overseas students. The public will also be engaged through various activities, including science days at the Birmingham &amp;quot;Think Tank&amp;quot; museum.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>396196</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Mr Fengjun Zhang at Qinghai Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences of China</gtr:description><gtr:id>39C9B4C9-D051-41F1-AD1A-171C12AB4D8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration has led to publication of a multi-disciplinary research paper.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7fdb12b9251.40853601-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaboration partners helped us with

Development of robust methods for simplified genome sequencing of large plant/crop populations.
Although the new generation sequencing techniques have opened a great deal of research opportunity for genome-wide genotyping, the cost of re-sequencing the whole genome still represents a bottleneck for implementing the technique for genotyping large populations. To address this issue, we have developed an optimized simplified genome-wide sequencing method (opRAD_seq) for genotyping large plant/crop populations. The computer guided opRAD-seq experiment design enables the flexibility of customized targeting of genome regions to be sequenced and confers a high efficiency to minimize presentation of non-nuclear DNA in the final sequencing data. Efficiency and robustness of the opRAD-seq protocols have been experimentally tested for genotyping diploid and tetraploid Arabidopsis and potato genomes. A paper reporting the research has been published as 
Jiang N, Fengjun Zhang, Jinhua Wu, Yue Chen, Xiaohua Hu, Ou Fang, Lindsey J. Leach, Di Wang, Zewei Luo* (2016) A highly robust and optimized sequence-based approach for genetic polymorphism discovery and genotyping in large plant populations. Theor. Appl. Genet. 129: 1739-57.

The research lays a solid basis to fulfil Objective 3 of the present project, i.e. to collect genome-wide genotyping of sequence variants in the segregating potato populations. 
(2). Development of novel statistical methods for calling tetraploid genotypes from genomic DNA sequence data 
SNP genotype calling from data of DNA sequence reads has been well developed and practised in diploid species (e.g. H Li Bioinformatics 201121: 2987-2993). However, the corresponding method is unavailable for tetraploids. Analogous in spirit to Li (2011), a likelihood based method has been developed for calling tetraploid genotypes from sequence reads, and we are testing the method by analysing sequencing data of our potato opRAD_seq experiments. A manuscript based on the development is under preparation. 
The progress made in this respect partly fulfils Objectives 3 (genetic map construction of DNA sequence polymorphic markers in autotetraploid potato) and Objective 4 (marker assisted mapping of tetraploid potato agronomic traits). 
(3). Development of statistical methods for quantitative genetic analysis in autotetraploid species
A quantitative genetic model bridges the genotypic effects of genes underlying a polygenic quantitative trait to the phenotype of the trait and is essential for any genetical analysis with quantitative traits including those in the present project. However, a theoretically rigorous and practically feasible method is still unavailable for quantitative genetic analysis in autotetraploids, which represent many economically and evolutionarily important plant and animal species. Under support of the project, we are developing quantitative genetic models based on the principle of orthogonal scale contrasts of the linear statistical model for quantifying genetic effects of autotetraploid species and the corresponding statistical methods for the model based analysis. We tested the model and methods through simulation study and are implementing the model and method to analyse phenotype data of about 10 agronomic traits collected from multiple year field trials of an outbred potato segregation population. A manuscript based on the development is under preparation. 

The progress made fulfils Objective 1 of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The analytical methods and experimental protocols developed so far by the project will be directly beneficial to plant/crop and animal geneticists or breeders for their genetic and genomic analyses to be performed on a rigorous scientific basis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D501C82C-1D43-4F8E-8468-92235BBCD454</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9469d4d3890.99818916</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.statisticalgenetics.info</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CA82EE4B-1DAD-4397-9E45-1CFC61D9F83E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Downregulation of DNMT3A by miR-708-5p Inhibits Lung Cancer Stem Cell-like Phenotypes through Repressing Wnt/?-catenin Signaling.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9367248b20a5f73288245be5be35b16a"><gtr:id>9367248b20a5f73288245be5be35b16a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Liu T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1078-0432</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa90506cceef1.18556318</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>67803F86-E652-4ED4-9947-7A0DE416302B</gtr:id><gtr:title>A highly robust and optimized sequence-based approach for genetic polymorphism discovery and genotyping in large plant populations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>TAG.
