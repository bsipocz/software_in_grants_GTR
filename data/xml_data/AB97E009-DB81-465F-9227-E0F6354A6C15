Six thermo-TRP channels has been reported including TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPM8 and TRPA1, with TRPV1 serving as the heat sensor; TRPM8 as the cold tranducer and TRPA1 as the extreme cold mediator. Thermo-TRP channels also enable us to detect environmental irritants, and are implicated in diversity of pathological processes including thermal, mechanical hyperalgesia, inflammatory and chemical-induced pain, which is believed to be mediated by TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channel; and cold analgesia, which is caused by the activation of TRPM8 ion channel. You may have such an experience of immersing your burning hands into cooling water to have a relief, a process involving activation of TRPV1 and TRPM8 ion channel, respectively. During inflammation and tissue damage released inflammatory mediators such as NGF, bradykinin sensitizes TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channel, explaining the most aspects of heat hyperalgesia and inflammatory pain. In contrast, bradykinin instead inhibited TRPM8 ion channel and thus making pain getting worse by sensitizing TRPV1 and inhibiting otherwise TRPM8 mediated analgesic effect. We will be interested in finding out how bradykinin produced inhibitory effect on TRPM8 channel; particularly we ask whether it?s caused by G protein signalling complexes. Remarkably we also identified PKCbeta as the endogenous TRPV1 binding protein to inhibit TRPV1 channel maturation and function, and found several thermo-TRP channels had constitutive and regulated modification of ubiquitination, a form of protein modification and acting as a sorting signal destined for degradation. We will be interested in dissecting out how PKCbeta downreguates TRPV1, and how ubiquitination regulates thermo-TRP channel trafficking and function with an ultimate aim to understanding how those thermo-TRP channels are differently modulated by even the same inflammatory mediators and signalling molecules, understanding their molecular determinants underlying those processes would provide fundamental basis to develop attractive novel drugs for the pain relief and treatment of hyperalgesia. We will investigate those queries using a combination of molecular biological, cell biological, electrophysiological approaches together with confocal imaging in both transfected HEK293 cells and DRG neurons.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Thermo-TRP channels expressed on somatosensory neurons enable us to detect environmental irritants, and are recognized as key players in thermosensation, inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia. We will aim to investigate negative regulation of thermo-TRP channels!? function with the following three main objectives using a combination of molecular biological, cell biological, electrophysiological approaches together with confocal imaging in both transfected HEK293 cells and DRG neurons.
1) Modulation of thermo-TRP channels, TRPV1, TRPM8 and TRPA1 by G protein signalling complexes. Both calcium imaging and whole cell patch will be used to study the effect of G protein activation and blocking on TRPM8-mediated current and bradykinin-induced inhibition of TRPM8 channel; we will identify major involved G protein subunit and use inside-out excised patch to test direct inhibition of TRPM8 channel by applying purified G proteins; possible direct interaction between G proteins and TRPM8 will be investigated by coimmunoprecipitation and pull down assay; similar approaches will also be used to study the role of G proteins in the activation of TRPV1 and TRPA1. We will attempt to explore the molecular determinants underlying the different gating of thermo-TRP channels by G proteins and chemical compounds by constructing chimera channel between TRPV1 and TRPM8. 
2) Molecular mechanisms underlying down-regulation of TRPV1-3 by conventional protein kinase C. We will map mutual interaction region between TRPV and PKCbeta as before; identify subcellular TRPV degradation compartments using proteasome and lysosome inhibitors; investigate whether PKCbeta could increase TRPV ubiquitination leading to the degradation?(also objective 3 below);we will quantify and correlate expression of TRPV1 and PKCbeta in DRG neurons; investigate functional downregulation of TRPV1 by PKCbeta in DRG neurons using patch clamp.
3) The role of ubiquitination of thermo-TRP channels in their trafficking and function. We will identify E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of different thermo-TRP channels by coimmunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assay; delineate ubiquitin binding sites on thermo-TRP channels by site-directed mutagenesis; Immunocytochemistry will be used to quantify channels internalization and recycling; western blot will be employed to probe degradation of channels; membrane protein biotinylation will be used to quantify surface channel expression following ubiquitination modification; Functional effect of ubiquitination on thermo-TRP-mediated current and desensitization will be studied by patch clamp.
 The work would help to satisfy public curiosity about pain and everyday life experience, and provide valuable basis for the development of novel analgesics for treatment of inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia and thus be beneficial to human health.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>504807</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited neuroscience talk in NeuroTalk-2014 Nanjing , China</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>60BFBC0F-AEBB-4E54-93DF-30EC277280DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference title: BIT's 5th annual world congress of NeuroTalk 2014, theme: From unresolved mysteries to market.

also reguested this construct to investigate the modulation of TASK ion channel by G proteins with me as a collaborator.

This G protein construct is valuable to investigate the ion channel regulation by G proteins, particularly valuable to discriminate the direct action of Galpha q protein on effectors from those caused by downstream signalling pathways activated by G proteins.

Prof. Alistar Mathie in the University of Kent also requested the 3Gqiq chimera for his research.
