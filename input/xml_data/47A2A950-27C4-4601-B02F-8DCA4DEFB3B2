Although we are beginning to understand the nature &amp;amp; magnitude of changes in the circulation of the North Atlantic over the last 10,000 years, terrestrial responses to these events are still poorly understood in terms of timing, magnitude &amp;amp; spatial pattern. It is imperative to rectify this deficiency in order to generate &amp;amp; test hypotheses to explain the processes of change, to understand the strength of relationships between oceanic &amp;amp; terrestrial climate change, &amp;amp; to enable future soil conditions &amp;amp; water resources to be predicted using computer models. Plan of work This project will investigate four sites located on a transect along the eastern seaboard of North America, from northern Newfoundland to Maine. This region was highly sensitive to past changes in ice sheet mass balance &amp;amp; ocean circulation. The selected sites are all raised (rain-fed) peat bogs, which provide superb climate archives. Plant &amp;amp; animal (testate amoebae) fossils preserved in well-dated cores extracted from these bogs will be used to reconstruct past changes in Bog Surface Wetness (an index of surface water balance) over the last 8500 years, at a time resolution of 10-100 years. The same core samples will be analysed for stable isotopes of oxygen &amp;amp; hydrogen. The spatial &amp;amp; temporal distribution of the heavy isotopes of these elements in precipitation is related to air temperature, &amp;amp; hence to atmospheric circulation. The isotope signal captured in the cellulose fraction of Sphagnum moss closely tracks that of the precipitation used by the plant for cellulose synthesis. Hence, fossil Sphagnum from raised peat preserves a clear signal of past changes in climate &amp;amp; atmospheric circulation. Modern precipitation along the eastern seaboard of North America is derived mainly from the Atlantic Ocean. A strong temperature contrast exists between the Arctic waters of the Labrador Current, which flows southwards along this coast, &amp;amp; the warm waters of the Gulf Stream further offshore. Past isotopic ratios in precipitation falling over coastal areas will have been strongly influenced by changes in these ocean currents &amp;amp; in the heat transport by the Gulf Stream. By combining the oxygen &amp;amp; hydrogen isotope records, we will estimate the deuterium excess, an index of the conditions prevailing at the sea surface when evaporation occurred, including the extent of sea ice. The stable isotope data will be compared with isotope measurements on ice cores from Greenland &amp;amp; Canadian ice caps, and more cautiously, with estimated isotope values for surface seawater &amp;amp; lakes that have been derived from sediment analyses. Hence, analyses of fossils &amp;amp; stable isotopes from the same core levels will allow us to reconstruct the timing, magnitude &amp;amp; spatial pattern of the terrestrial response, as well as exploring the impact of different causal factors such as meltwater discharges, changes in atmospheric &amp;amp; ocean circulation &amp;amp; solar variability on the climate of the study area. In this way, insight will be gained into the mechanisms that have driven climate change over the last 8500 years. Hypotheses to be tested: 1) Between 8500 &amp;amp; 6800 years ago, the climate of the study area was strongly influenced by repeated discharges of glacial meltwater from the decaying North American Ice Sheet to the north, resulting in cooling &amp;amp; increased bog wetness. 2) After the disappearance of the ice sheet, 6800 years ago, the climate of the study area was indirectly influenced by cyclical variations in sea ice extent, ocean currents &amp;amp; deepwater formation north of Iceland.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>163590</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>PRECIP Project Research Outcomes



Geochronology - A New Tephrostratigraphy Famework



The PRECIP project has recently located ultra-distal tephras in four study sites from Newfoundland Nova Scotia and Maine. These tephras have been geochemically characterized and traced to source volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and to Alaska. The fine volcanic ash layers represent the first finds of ultra-distal tephra in terrestrial records from Eastern North America and their identification demonstrates that tephra isochrones can be extended right across the continent. This finding is important because it establishes a high precision chronological framework for the study of the Holocene in eastern North America. The earliest identifiable tephra is the Mazama ash, which dates to 7650 cal. BP. Details of the full tephrostratigraphy from eastern Newfoundland have been published in:

J., Mauquoy, D., Street-Perrott, F. A., Woodman-Ralph, J. (2012) High-precision ultra-distal Holocene tephrochronology in North America. Quaternary Science Reviews 52, 6 - 11.



Peat-based reconstructions of hydrological change inferred from Holocene bog surface wetness records (BSW):



Over the last two years the PRECIP project has developed the most detailed and longest records of Holocene water table change in ombrotrophic bogs yet produced from Atlantic Canada and Maine. In the north of the study transect the records span the period 7500 cal. BP to present and the longest records from Nova Scotia cover the whole Holocene. The past water table reconstructions have been completed for all of the main study sites and they show significant down-core variability that will allow us to assess regional patterns of hydrological change in relation to the hypotheses being tested. The records will be pinned together using high quality age-depth models based on the ultra-distal tephras and AMS radiocarbon dates.



Past water table records were reconstructed using a combination of plant macrofossil and testate amoebae sub-fossil identifications. Testate amoebae surface samples from the four main study sites, and a wide range of further sites from across the study region, were used to establish a transfer function for the reconstruction of past water table variations. The transfer function has been published in:

Journal of Quaternary Science. doi: 10.1002/jqs.2584.



This study benefitted from additional data collected as part of a collaboration with the Universit&amp;eacute; du Qu&amp;eacute;bec &amp;agrave; Montr&amp;eacute;al (UQAM).



Development of Stable Carbon and Water Isotopes as Palaeoclimate Proxies:



Results from the array of modern samples of bog and leaf waters reveal that the different bogs fall along different evaporative lines. This is a noteworthy finding because it assists in interpretation of isotopic variability down-core and importantly, between sites. The spatial patterns of different isotope parameters exhibit the expected large-scale gradients polewards and into the interior of the continent, but also suggest that the Gulf of St. Lawrence plays a significant role as a local moisture source in summer.



Both carbon and oxygen isotopes in modern cellulose show an isotopic fractionation as one moves further from the water table. This trend has not been identified previously and would indicate that the Sphagnum isotope signal can integrate several signals within it. Initial tests using the measures of distance to water table provided by the testate amoebae to &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; the isotopes for this enrichment effect indicate that its impact on the overall trend in the isotopic data is small when viewed over centennial to millennial time scales. Further work is on going and hydrogen isotopes will shortly be added to the dataset.



Analysis of modern inter-plant variability indicates the range of uncertainty observed in the isotopic data. These findings suggest that approximately 10-15 plants sampled from a single level will provide a robust mean signal and a workable oxygen-isotopic uncertainty range (95%) roughly equivalent to machine uncertainty (ca. &amp;plusmn;0.3 per mille).
