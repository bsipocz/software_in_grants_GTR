- Improving knowledge about emerging social media technologies and usage amongst armed forces personnel and their families in order to assist future strategic planning.
- Developing new capacity to anticipate and intervene in social media management (e.g. intervening to pre-empt rumour diffusion, trolling, misinformation).
- Improving MOD capacity to respond an increasingly socially networked world where technological and behavioural change is likely to be rapid (e.g. geo-tagging tweets and associated security implications regarding location identification). 
1. Our innovative use of qualitative and quantitative methodologies including network sampling, topological analysis and user-mapping will enable insights into how our research communities use online social media to communicate and become enrolled into particular communities. As well as providing a) the ability for MOD and Royal Marines to better understand these trends the research will b) provide recommendations on MOD guidance and policy on social media and c) via established algorithms and detailed qualitative methods, deliver a framework which allows the detection and anticipation of the formation of issues around morale, homesickness, and broader issues of concern.
2. Our qualitative methodologies, especially participatory mapping with Royal Marines and their families, will facilitate more nuanced understandings of geographical and social mapping of online social media behaviour including networking. This approach, especially as participants are asked to reflect on their perceived social media and the quantitative visualization of social networks, will allow families, friends and service personnel to better understand the complexity of social media and its potential wider impact on the morale of group, unit and battalion, as well as wider public awareness. 
3. Enhancing co-operation within central government departments and other interested stakeholders concerned with social media usage and associated challenges including security risk. The employment mediation agency (ACAS) have warned that billions of pounds are lost every year addressing costs associated with cyber bullying, trolling, defamation, freedom of speech and invasion of privacy - regulating the personal/professional usage of staff in agencies like the HMRC is a matter of growing concern. The analytical tools and software prototypes developed within the project will have value in data and network science as well as commercial value in social media analytics. Our work will have future impact for other government departments and large organisations in terms of better understanding how personnel (e.g. FCO overseas posted staff) use social media technologies to interact with families and friends in the UK, and the relationship between these interactions for the structure of organisations and how they are perceived, both internally and externally. There are other public authorities that grapple with the issuance of formal guidance on social media technologies and their usage. These would include Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for International Development, the Prison Service, the Department for Communities and Local Government. 
4. Our work will interest social media consultancies and organizations (e.g. Storyful) and think tanks who work on social media technologies both present and future and produce twitter listing, social media memes and content feeds, or examine the relationship between social media and their implications for defense and security (see Arab Spring, Gaza conflict etc.). With the appointment of a project advisory board, to include representatives from these four interested constituencies working in close collaboration with DSTL, the project will offer wider implications and recommendations for those organisations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>237556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ministry of Defence presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CFC94D53-5B30-4D1A-B343-8C5E6ADF2150</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a focussed presentation and extensive discussion with invited participants from different MOD departments engaged in digital communication, social media training and security.

In particular, they have been employed to restructure internal communications, as well as influencing education and policies in relation to digital technologies/social media usage by military personnel and their families. 

One example of exploitation within the Ministry of Defence is a UK-India programme where the findings are used as part of a project on psychological resilience. Another example is the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory's 'Warfare in the Information Age' project, where findings will be used to address emergent concepts where social media is relevant. 

We have also been informed that the findings are being considered at a 3-star Chief of Defence Personnel level, and will inform programme requirements. 

However, due to the sensitive nature of the findings and the security clearances needed to gain further information about the ways in which the data have been used, we are not in a position to provide detailed accounts of the direct impact of the research on policy and practice. It should be stressed that the researchers themselves have not given specific information about how project findings have been employed by key stakeholders, but have only received a general indication of their use throughout the defence community.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>65B6FC7A-96FC-4BCB-905A-E64FAA7CBF76</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5730742fd39ee9.31496544</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Social media has become central to military life, making it a critical component of future policy development and welfare planning. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and WhatsApp challenge the Ministry of Defence's traditional communication and social structures. 

Here, we outline the most significant findings and suggest how they might influence policies and procedures on social media, which is what we originally set out to do.

'Digital by default'. 
The availability of digital technologies in the Services has made personnel and their families avid social media users. More than 70 per cent of personnel aged 18-34 use social media several times a day, whilst 70 per cent of personnel aged 35 or above use it at least once a day. Seven per cent of personnel do not use social media. For families, this is only two per cent. 

Facebook is the preferred platform with over 80 per cent of all personnel and 90 per cent of all families using it, across the Services. 
WhatsApp has been informally integrated into some military units to seamlessly distribute messages within work teams, replacing traditional top-down communication channels.
Twitter is used by only a quarter of personnel across the ranks. Yet our analysis of network data indicates that certain military groupings can be identified on Twitter simply by virtue of their connections. 
LinkedIn, which is primarily used by senior personnel, is often used without the same level of care as Facebook, and can lead to unintended exposure. 

***

Management of Expectations. 
One of the main observations from the research concerns the management of expectations. There is now an expectation that social media will be available throughout the deployment cycle as noted by most junior personnel and their families.
If expectations are not met, increased disgruntlement and a decrease in morale are just two of the potential consequences evidenced by the research. Where access is limited, unavailable, or seen to be of poor quality, our findings suggest that junior personnel in particular find innovative ways of connecting using different mobile devices. This can lead to an array of security concerns as users are unable to control how messages are transmitted, and who has access to such messages. This is of particular concern when non-UK servers are used.

***

Ad hoc approach to training. 
The research has revealed an ad hoc approach to social media in education and training across the Royal Navy, the Army, and the RAF along with a lack of coordination between the three Services. It also revealed little evidence of any coherent framework for dealing with the intentional and/ or thoughtless misuse of social media. 

On average only around 40 per cent of personnel have received any form of social media training. This figure is higher for personnel aged 18-34 (around 50 per cent) and lower for personnel aged 35 or above (between 30-40 per cent).
Respondents who had received social media training noted a reliance on out-of-date examples in training materials and a lack of consistency. Research revealed limited knowledge of relevant social media guidelines, instructions and awareness campaigns amongst military personnel at all ranks. The perception of disciplinary action relating to the abuse of social media are many and varied, and sometimes unfair, amongst personnel. No or little difference was detected between the ranks and Services. There is no social media training or education in place for families. This was seen as particularly problematic by personnel across the ranks. 

***

Generation gap. 
The research has identified a generation gap. Usage and expectations differ between senior and junior personnel as noted above. Awareness and training varies. 

The level of expertise held by many junior personnel is being overlooked by the more senior personnel. This finding is consistent across the Services. An unwillingness on the part of some senior personnel to engage with, or attempt to understand the nature and purpose of social media use, is evident throughout the Services. There is a reluctance to exploit the pool of knowledge embedded within the junior ranks.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As part of our key findings we have set out a number of recommendations that we believe the military as a whole as well as the individual Services (the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force) should take forward in order to benefit from research outcomes. 

A full report will be available in January 2016, which will set out a complete list of recommendations. Here, we outline some of the overall recommendations in no particular order:

1. The research has revealed an extensive use of social media amongst personnel and their families regardless of Service and rank. We therefore recommend that the military embraces social media to a much greater extent and encourages responsible usage through investments in education. Social media cannot be understood as one entity, it is important to consider the specific features and usages of each platform.

2. It is critical that the military manage the expectations of personnel and of Service families in order to uphold morale and wellbeing. We recommend that each Service develops and provides clear and up-to date information about social media access before deployment and before re-assignment to a new location in the UK or overseas. This is also important in relation to recruitment and retention. Therefore, institutional expectations in terms of social media access and use must be clearly publicised and expectations must be seen to be fair. 

3.There is an urgent need for improved and consistent training and education procedures across the ranks and across the Services. It is crucial that training materials are regularly updated and make use of recent examples. Social media guidelines should be consistent across the three Services in order to present coherent and clear policies. We therefore recommend a higher degree of coordination between the Royal Navy, the Army, and the RAF in terms of social media. Developing specific training materials and education packages for military families is also strongly recommended. 

4. A clear and consistent policy on sanctions related to the misuse of social media is needed. Sanctions should be perceived to be fair if they are to be effective. They should emphasise the importance of compliance and explain the relevance to the military institution and to the individual. Sanctions might be used more as an educational tool rather than as a mechanism for disciplining personnel.

5. Personnel might hold social media expertise that can benefit the military. In many respects, the military establishment is lagging behind the new generation of social media users within their own ranks. In developing appropriate social media policy to meet current and future expectations from personnel, we recommend that the military finds ways of utilising the knowledge and skillset that this 'new generation' of military personnel possess with respect to social media. This will be particularly important in relation to future recruitment and retention.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A8807851-70F9-4DA0-9D77-1570123F041C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55f155db3dcdb4.51097389</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E64595D0-98B5-4215-B732-19BFB2E2D64F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Twitter users change word usage according to conversation-partner social identity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Networks</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7044a66f43a8b1f48a41ab805d078e2e"><gtr:id>7044a66f43a8b1f48a41ab805d078e2e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tamburrini N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>55b26f920b15c3.72759535</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>84D0A17E-41EF-45C8-91B9-4CED113D5024</gtr:id><gtr:title>Article</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Conversation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/16d0b46c80b4eb851add931d033cbda8"><gtr:id>16d0b46c80b4eb851add931d033cbda8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jensen, R.
