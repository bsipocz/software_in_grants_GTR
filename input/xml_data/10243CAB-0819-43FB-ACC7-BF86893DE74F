Many of them suffer physical or psychological consequences as a result of their role. Although the GP is supposed to co-ordinate their support, in many cases that does not happen. Mid Hants Primary Care Trust in association with the carer?s charity, the Princess Royal Trust for carers, are setting up a scheme to support carers in the community in which GPs refer carers to the Princess Royal Trust when they are identified so that they can receive a comprehensive information pack and a tailor-made assessment. This project aims to evaluate that scheme by randomly allocating carers referred to basic information or the complete package. By comparing the groups we can assess the effectiveness of the full package, as compared to simple basic information, in terms of health of the carer and cost. If the scheme proves to be effective it could be the basis for many other schemes elsewhere in the country resulting in better carer support and possibly less health consequences long-term for the carers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>There are six million carers in the UK - usually friends or relatives of a disabled, elderly or frail person who provide help and support for no payment. Carers experience physical and psychological problems with up to half suffering from stress related illnesses. Most have seen their GP recently and think the GP can make the most difference to their lives. Unfortunately carers often feel their GPs do not understand their needs or do as much as they could to help. GPs do not feel it is their role to support carers unless a problem arises even though recent Government initiatives have placed them at the centre of carer support. 
Mid Hants Primary Care Trust in association with the carer?s charity, the Princess Royal Trust for carers, are setting up a scheme to support carers in the community. When GPs identify a carer a prescription will be generated referring the carer to the Princess Royal Trust. They will contact the carer and send comprehensive information. Each carer will then be invited for interview to assess needs and improve carer support. The aim is to evaluate the service in terms of carer health and cost. 

This is a randomised controlled trial in which carers will be assigned to receive either basic information or the full package of support. All participants will be interviewed at baseline, three and twelve months after recruitment. The main outcome measures will be the mental health and vitality subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire. This questionnaire measures physical and mental well-being. Carers with unmet needs score poorly on these particular subscales. If the new scheme results in needs being met, scores on these scales should improve relative to those receiving only basic information (control group). Other measures will include quality of life, burden of care, service use and cost of care. 

As these measures cannot provide all the information we want about the scheme, we will chose a small sample of carers and referring GPs to represent broad range of views after the main interviews are complete. They will be interviewed with a tape recorder, allowing them to tell us what they think about the scheme with no restrictions imposed by pre-set questionnaires. Tapes will be transcribed and points raised grouped to give a coherent overall picture, enabling us to interpret the earlier interviews more fully and identify areas for improvement within the scheme.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-06-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2003-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>237517</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8A2FBC5C-6D21-4C8D-A2D2-084E013B62B3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cohort study of informal carers of first-time stroke survivors: profile of health and social changes in the first year of caregiving.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social science &amp; medicine (1982)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/77a6db165ec09f529bac7a7976a443a0"><gtr:id>77a6db165ec09f529bac7a7976a443a0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Simon C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0277-9536</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>G7AzMENaaWX</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EB2BEB4F-1085-44F5-A11E-C92F9E3702BB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Formal support of stroke survivors and their informal carers in the community: a cohort study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health &amp; social care in the community</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/77a6db165ec09f529bac7a7976a443a0"><gtr:id>77a6db165ec09f529bac7a7976a443a0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Simon C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0966-0410</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>Q38gAEqnABp</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G106/1165</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>AAFE74BF-2594-40A4-9487-23A469C7A3C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.6  Psychological and behavioural</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
