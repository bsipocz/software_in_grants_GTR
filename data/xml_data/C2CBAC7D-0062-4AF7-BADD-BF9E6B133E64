The word complex refers to the ignorance of the mathematical community half a millennium ago - complex objects are often simpler to study than real objects. From this perspective one should ask the question when is a given object actually real? With complex numbers, quadratic equations always have 2 solutions - this is precisely why complex numbers were first introduced into mathematics. But this is not quite true - sometimes the 2 solutions are actually the same. This is an example of where do things break down - special equations have only one solution not two (or rather, a repeated solution). Where things break down, or equivalently, where objects are singular, is known as the discriminant.Another example comes from looking at kaleidoscopes. If you take one apart you will find two mirrors set at an angle of 60 degrees to each other. This angle is crucial - move it slightly and you will get a jumble of images and the nice symmetric pattern is lost. Is 60 (=180/3) the only angle for which you get a nice pattern? No: 90 (=180/2) will work, as will 45 (=180/4). In fact, any angle of the form 180/N, for N=2,3,4,... will produce is nice symmetric, kaleidoscopic pattern. The mathematics used to describe symmetries is called group theory , and the groups associated to these special angles are examples of objects called Coxeter Groups. These groups describe symmetries of objects.Now imagine one point inside the kaleidoscope. It will have an image in each mirror, and each image has yet more secondary images etc.. When the angle between these mirrors takes one of these special values one only gets a finite number of images: Coxeter groups are finite reflection group. The original point I asked you to imagine was inside the kaleidoscope. What happens if the point is actually on one of the mirrors? Normally a point has a reflection - this is what we mean by a mirror image. But a point on a mirror is its own mirror image - the point and its image coincide. Such a point will still have a finite number of multiple images (because it will be reflected in the other mirror), but the number of images will be less than for an ordinary point inside. These mirror points correspond to a an object known as a discriminant. It is not an accident that this same word has been used twice - the same mathematics underlies both areas. So where are these two questions to be applied?Take three numbers and multiple them together. The answer does not depend on the order you do the calculation. The process of multiplication is commutative: AxB=BxA and associative (AxB)xC=Ax(BxC). But mathematicians can multiple other things together than just numbers. Vectors have size and direction / think of a weather map covered with arrows where the direction of the arrow shows the direction of the wind and the size of the arrow the speed of the wind. Can one multiple such vectors together in such a way that the multiplication is both commutative and associative?The answer to this question is yes , and this leads to a mathematical object known as a Frobenius manifold. Frobenius manifolds are amazing objects, for all sorts of reasons. They sits at the crossroads of pure mathematics and applied mathematics, as well as mathematical and theoretical physics.Basics examples come from the study of kaleidoscopes, as described above. However, Frobenius manifolds are complex objects, and one can thus ask the original questions: when are objects real? and where do things break down . Frobenius manifolds have huge symmetries, but these are often hidden and have to be extracted carefully and another idea of this proposal is to study their symmetries, and how the trio of ideas: reality, symmetry and singular objects, interact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? The beneficiaries of the proposed work are academics working in the general field of integrable systems and their application. This is a very large field which cuts across traditional boundaries of pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. It utilizes techniques drawn from algebra, geometry and differerntial equations to study certain problems, manu of which originally arose in mathematicsl physics (e.g. topological quantum field theory). Given this background, the beneficiaries of this research can be expected to be drawn from a very wide range of research communities within mathematics and physics. How will they benefit from this research? They will benefit from the use in their own research of the ideas and techniques that will follows from the succesfull realization of the project's aims. The timescales will also be much longer than the length of the grant period. The project seeks funds for a short term visitor programme (length 3 months) to kick start various research programmes. Thus the full impact of the proposed research will only occur many months, if not years, from the end of the visitor programme. What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research? Results will be submitted for publication in leading international jouranls, and posted prior to that on the ArXiv web site (now a traditional way to disseminate research). In addition, copies will be availbable from the PI's website which will include other preprints, copies of conference presentations and links to published articles. Talks on this work will also be given at various future international conferences. To further dissemination of the results, the two visitors will be invited to speak at one of the LMS Classical and Quantum Integrability meetings organised by the Universities of Edinbugh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt, Leeds and Loughborough. As the visitors are international (from the EU and Canada) they will also disseminate the results themselves. A review article is also planned on tt*-geometry, which would explain recent advances in the field (which have been mostly geometric) to the integrability community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16032</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7B8F2DCB-2991-4656-9681-E8B2E4DC9E40</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dubrovin's duality for F-manifolds with eventual identities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8054245efaefa4803c071fa4c2db63c2"><gtr:id>8054245efaefa4803c071fa4c2db63c2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>David L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe2fe2b882e23</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>73B20399-A048-48A8-B6A1-F371264767CF</gtr:id><gtr:title>WORKSHOP ISLAND 3 ALGEBRAIC ASPECTS OF INTEGRABILITY</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Glasgow Mathematical Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/973301741276f8315392463bb83999c8"><gtr:id>973301741276f8315392463bb83999c8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Feigin M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f952952e9d54f0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>639C199A-800D-4227-899B-601E70D50B04</gtr:id><gtr:title>Symmetries of F-manifolds with eventual identities and special families of connections</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/583e7d46cb2a0da9162678e460c674c3"><gtr:id>583e7d46cb2a0da9162678e460c674c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Liana David (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>r_322165366363cc3230</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H019553/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9C124926-5968-486F-9B51-CCEB6C4E9650</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>65</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>65</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
