This Open NERC Knowledge Exchange Fellowship will help policy-makers and practitioners achieve these goals by producing best-practice guidelines for upland natural process restoration or 'rewilding'. This will be achieved by bringing together a network of primarily NERC funded academics, with practitioners, policy-makers, professional bodies and businesses to exchange knowledge and experience. Success will help safe guard natural heritage for future generations, alleviate major national challenges such as flooding and water quality, and provide more resilient rural communities and economies. Rewilding is an emerging approach within inter-disciplinary conservation science. It is proposed as a complementary method to established biodiversity conservation by re-establishing natural processes to allow ecosystems to restore and sustain themselves. Where successful it will deliver a sustainable and cost-effective approach to conservation by reducing the recurrent costs associated with direct management.

The overall aim of this Knowledge Exchange fellowship is to facilitate the restoration of naturally functioning upland ecosystems in Britain. The uplands are an important starting point because the impacts of actions here cascade down through river catchments with the flow of water, sediments and nutrients. The critical, overarching, natural processes considered for restoration will be predation, herbivory, disturbance and hydrology. The key objectives are: 1) to bring together academics, practitioners, policy makers and businesses in three workshops to co-produce best-practice guidelines to inform policy on natural process restoration; and 2) to disseminate these guidelines through direct engagement with stakeholders and through the creation of an online platform of resources. 

Rewilding Britain is a UK charity that aspires to see habitats expand, wildlife multiply, and communities flourish with new opportunities. An important ambition for Rewilding Britain is to work with the academic community to collate, synthesise and disseminate the best available research to their partners, government bodies, landowners and the public. They wish to use this collaboration to create and maintain an online 'Rewilding Knowledge Hub' to engage stakeholders and the public.

While rewilding presents an exciting opportunity, it currently lacks a specific evidence base to properly assess its feasibility, value, risks and associated costs. There is, however, a considerable amount of relevant fundamental and applied conservation, ecology, ecohydrology, and socio-economics research that could aid the development of rewilding policy and best-practice. NERC has been an integral funder of much of this research. This Knowledge Exchange project will collate and synthesise the research of academic partners including Prof. Y. Malhi, Prof. D.W. Macdonald, Prof. W. Sutherland, Prof. R. Brazier, Prof. A. Newton, Dr. S. Carver, Dr. P. Jepson, and the applicant Dr. C.J. Sandom. 

This synthesised knowledge will serve as a primer for a two-way knowledge exchange with the project's practical and policy partners through two workshops on the approaches, value, risks and costs of rewilding. A third workshop will be dedicated to co-produce best-practice guidelines for natural process restoration. Project partners include Rewilding Britain, John Muir Trust, Wild Europe, Woodland Trust, and Conservation Capital. Through stakeholder engagement and the development of best-practice guidelines, land managers will be able to identify and select appropriate cost-effective actions to reinstate upland natural processes as a result of this project. This will result in nature-based socio-economic development in the uplands that cascades downstream with the flow of water.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22178</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Colette Beckham, Chief executive of Cornwall AONB</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7EB6EC7F-B6A5-43E0-B988-1521E643C9F3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Meet with the chief executive of the Cornwall AONB to discuss if, where, when, and how rewilding could be a supported land management strategy within the Cornwall AONB.

Outcomes: Colette Backham shared with me the aims and the responsibilities of AONBs, and the particular issues facing the Cornwall AONB. There was important discussion about the AONBs responsibility to protect the 'natural beauty' and 'landscape character' of the region. Colette believes that while this is a vague goal, it is a goal that resonates strongly with local stakeholders. There is also a strong sense that rewilding could be considered a threat to the landscape character of the region. However, she also highlighted that in some regions stakeholders are actively allowing change because they, for example, don't want fences erected to manage grazing intensity because they don't want fences to restrict access. She also indicated that she is in discussion with a farmer who wishes to consider beaver reintroduction on their land. She also indicated that a Knowledge Hub about rewilding ideas could be useful.

Impacts: Colette wishes to attend the workshop I am organising as part of my NERC KE fellowship to engage policy-makers, practitioners, and academics on: When, Where and How could ideas around rewilding be used to better support biodiversity and society in Britain's uplands post-Brexit?

Next steps: Send invitation to the workshop, and offer support for current rewilding related activities occurring in the Cornwall AONB.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58aee6ef828400.39088424</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Phone call with Rebecca Isted - Forestry Commission</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C2686B95-3D40-4D29-88D5-BA429125B30E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss how rewilding is and could be used in the forestry commission. Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps. 

Outcomes: Research gaps identified: 1) Explore the extent to which natural tree regeneration is being used as a means to restore woodland. 2) Explore whether favourable condition designations can be usefully altered to allow more favourable conservation. Advice and guidance needs: 1) Identify regions where natural tree regeneration is a viable approach to woodland regeneration. 2) Explore how knowledge about the landscape of fear and indirect effects on herbivores can be used to more naturally regulate herbivore numbers. 3) Develop best-practice policy to guide species reintroduction for ecological, social, economic benefits based on the updated IUCN species translocation guidelines. 4) Highlight and promote further research into processes associated with soil.

Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding in the Uplands. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps.

Outcomes: Rewilding means different things to different people, with George Monbiot driving a radical agenda that is threatening some farmers. There is a need to determine if alternative business models could be established in the uplands. He believes there is a useful discussion to be had around the potential for rural upland communities to deliver ecosystem services. He does not think that there is currently much scope to deviate from management based on recommended guidelines. He believes there is considerable relevant scientific evidence available that could be useful, but that it is behind a paywall. Thinks a Knowledge Hub of relevant information would be useful.

Impacts: Paul wishes to attend the workshop I am organising as part of my NERC KE fellowship to engage policy-makers, practitioners, and academics on: When, Where and How could ideas around rewilding be used to better support biodiversity and society in Britain's uplands post-Brexit?

Next steps: Send invitation to the workshop</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b061272fec73.70062153</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Phone call with Norman Cowling - Dartmoor Preservation Association</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54D74009-CA36-47F2-A3BB-B8E8DA4449BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss what rewilding means, if, how, where and when it could be used, identify the practical and policy barriers to rewilding, identify research gaps.

Outcomes: Rewilding is a spectrum, ranging from low intervention management to George Monbiot's more radical vision. 

Barriers: There is a sense that people do not want the change in the landscape that these visions of rewilding will cause. The common land structure, multiple different common areas that have different rules and rights but combine to form one large area makes cooperation difficult. 

Opportunities: There is a realisation that biodiversity is in decline, and there is a sense that some would like to see a more natural set of processes function in the landscape.

Research gaps: We need to improve our ability to predict what will happen under rewilding, and communicate it effectively with stakeholders.

Next steps: Invite Norman to the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7a163bf25b8.54131192</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Phone call with Chris Kaighin</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CDBD6E79-0CDE-46FD-83D1-54846BD05211</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss what rewilding means to Natural England. Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding in the Uplands. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps.

Outcomes: 
Meaning: Rewilding is being discussed but there is no official policy on rewilding in either Natural England or DEFRA. However, Natural England is involved with the Wild Ennerdale project, which he considers to be consistent with a rewilding project. NE are seeking to deliver resilient landscapes, and CK believes rewilding could be consistent with this ambition.

Barriers and Opportunities: The continued decline in biodiversity in Britain suggests we can't manage for all species directly, so rewilding presents an alternative approach. The current requirements of favourable condition of certain habitats and species is limiting the opportunities for experimentation in National Nature Reserves (Great Asby Scar was given as an example of this)

Research gaps: 1) Determine the potential for favourable condition to be determined by the functioning of ecological processes. 2) Can rewilding help deliver resilient landscapes? If so, when, where and how? 3) Can the outcomes of rewilding be reliably predicted?

Next steps: Invite Chris to the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ba75d70d4244.70438112</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Upland Alliance Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>84B0718D-03D7-4CB3-AC74-ACEF84772597</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a stakeholder workshop run by the Upland Alliance and hosted by DEFRA. The workshop had three main aims:

&amp;quot;? To share insights on how to motivate and support upland land management;
? To explore the potential impacts of four upland support scenarios as a means to
identifying key issues, concerns and opportunities for future policy;
? To collate recommendations for policy planning and evidence-gathering.&amp;quot;

I contributed to a workshop discussion group on Vibrant Cultural Landscapes. My contributions were recorded and logged in the outcomes report published by the Uplands Alliance. Rewilding was an important part of the discussions. I discovered some willingness from some practitioners and policy-makers to consider rewilding opportunities. This workshop has led to host of further meetings to discuss the potential role rewilding could have in the British uplands.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58aee35012fca9.29511072</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://uplandsalliance.wordpress.com/events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Phone conversation with Patrick Thompson RSPB</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9B38F397-FA69-4AE7-B62A-3874D2D9AE97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended Purpose
Discuss how rewilding is and could be used by the RSPB in the uplands. Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps.

Outcomes: The RSPB is interested in the opportunities rewilding presents. They recognise that rewilding means different things to different people. To the Pat, rewilding means working with ecological processes, and believes this is consistent with RSPB policy for some time. The RSPB is currently developing their own position on rewilding, and Pat has recommended speaking to Gareth Cummings about it.

Barriers: Coping with multipurpose landuse and a nature based approach to management can be challenging. Brexit is creating a tension in the conservation community with some seeing it as a risk and others an opportunity.

Research gaps: Determine whether rewilding can reduce management costs. Determine to what extent rewilding can help restore ecosystem services. 

Knowledge Exchange: Believes a website can fail to engage people, but a regular conference/workshop and forum could be useful.

Next steps
Pat will send information about the RSPB work on connecting health and nature. I will invite Pat to the rewilding workshop. Pat will put me in touch with Gareth Cummings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9cae79f2255.73770754</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Phone call with Keith Jones - Forestry Commission</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4D49E76-CE7C-47DF-82CE-CBA61587CB2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss how rewilding is and could be used in the forestry commission. Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps.

Outcomes: The focus of the discussion about rewilding was on tree regeneration. Tree regeneration to help alleviate flooding is a key issue currently and one that is closely connected to the debate around rewilding. The FC is looking for evidence based solutions, and currently this means woodland regeneration in small catchments (&amp;lt;100 km2) that include settlements facing a flood risk is being considered. More research is needed to identify the best opportunities for using this approach, and to identify which other circumstances would make tree regeneration particularly worthwhile (e.g. tourism, biodiversity, water quality). Keith believes rewilding must be subject to proper Environmental Impact Assessments, just as a woodland creation project would need. This raises the question: how could an EIA be carried out for a rewilding project and its associated uncertainties.
Keith indicated that the discussion I had with him promoted discussion of this issue within the Forestry Commission.

Next steps: Invitation to workshop but Keith is unable to attend. I have asked for a possible replacement. Opportunity to follow up with key questions and develop a research agenda in this area.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b802626f6f14.02505314</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Christopher Price - CLA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1FAD4C33-1B53-40FE-9955-5296F7687113</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss what rewilding means to the CLA and its members. Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding in the Uplands. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps.

Outcomes: 
Meaning: Rewilding includes a spectrum of activities, to some it signifies excitement, to others fear. 

Barriers and Opportunities: Where rewilding includes species reintroductions, clear exit, mitigation and compensation strategies are needed. Rewilding needs support from both land owners and managers, and their views may not align. Rewilding needs to take place over large areas. The CLA may be more willing to support innovative approaches like the Nature Improvement Areas in the future. 

Next steps: Invite Christopher to the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6ee4997eb26.91731747</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Robin Milton (NFU)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D7CD5D1-DBC5-4967-AFC2-EA3C396139CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss what rewilding means to farmers. Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding on farmed land. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps.

Outcomes: A very constructive discussion was held in which Robin was able to describe how practices on his farm land have changed. He reported that they have taken some land out of agri-environmental schemes to increase production, allowing less favourable areas to have more dedicated environmental work. Robin also discussed ways in which he would like to see the subsidy system altered. He believes there needs to be more support of ecosystem services and natural capital, but thinks these concepts are two complex to form the basis of policy directly. He believes subsidy should be put in place to support grassland as the primary unit, but also supporting special features such as trees, hedgerows, ponds and woodland. He would like to see more freedom for farmers/land managers to devise and implement their own schemes in consultation with DERFA and Natural England.

Next steps: Invite Robin to the workshop. Take up invitation to meet more NFU people.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ba5e70834b92.35596704</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Kevin Bishop CEO Dartmoor NP</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4EE8A9B0-41F1-477A-A08D-AE8B12DEB261</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss how rewilding is and could be used in Dartmoor. Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps. 

Outcomes: 
Rewilding is seen as spectrum of ideas ranging from reduced management to the wholesale change in approach put forward by George Monbiot. 

Many see the value of many of England's treasured landscapes as a mix between natural and human processes, and that removing the human element lessens the value of these landscapes. Dartmoor seeks to facilitate discussion between land owners/managers to find common ground. A rewilding approach could threaten this because ecological processes tend to work over large areas. Dartmoor is employing restoration of peatlands in a way that could be considered rewilding. Dartmoor is also increasing the skills of farmers so that they are able to do their own monitoring of SSSIs.

Research gaps: Identifying to what extent rewilding is already happening within Dartmoor.

Next steps: Invite Kevin to the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b98f4a726730.13872621</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Phone call with Fiona Howie</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>135B63C7-AB3C-454A-9396-1BDA44D4792D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss what rewilding means. Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps. 

Outcomes: Rewilding means different things to different people. The spectrum ranges from less intensive management to animal reintroductions. The former is seen as broadly acceptable, while the latter creates nervousness. The role of ecological processes are not part of the debate yet.

Research Gaps: There needs to be a strategic debate about what types of rewilding are appropriate where.

Barriers: A barrier is that nature led management might not provide the multipurpose landscape that is desired in national parks.

Opportunities: Brexit is being seen as an opportunity, particularly linking funding to the delivery of ecosystem services. Disseminating knowledge relevant to rewilding would be seen as helpful.

Next steps: Invite Fiona to the 2nd of May workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c287488431b3.66159725</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Nigel Stone and Sarah Bryan of Exmoor NP</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8204953B-899F-477D-B454-3B09A29A416B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss how rewilding is and could be used in Exmoor. Identify risks and opportunities of rewilding. Identify policy barriers. Identify research gaps. 

Outcomes: 
Rewilding lacks a clear definition, and is usually associated with tree regeneration and the reintroduction of large predators. There is also a feeling it is being targeted in places that are already wild, rather than rewilding areas that have been most disturbed by people. There is a sense that rewilding is already taking place on Exmoor, through reduced management by some land owners/managers.

Research gaps identified: need to identify what rewilding is occurring to date. There is a need to clarify what rewilding means and entails. Exmoor are considering management strategies that could be seen as a form of rewilding. 

Brexit is seen as both a risk and an opportunity for the environment. Changes to subsidy regimes may allow a more diverse approach to farming.

Next steps: Invite Nigel and Sarah to the workshop. I have arranged to speak at the Exmoor Commoners Association AGM about rewilding after Sarah connected us.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9863e3f2943.97456285</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Phone call with Paul Esrich - Malvern Hills AONB</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BF534D1E-81C3-41E4-9F33-C68C10D7CA22</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intended purpose: Discuss what rewilding means, if, how, where and when it could be used, identify the practical and policy barriers to rewilding, identify research gaps.

Outcomes: Current legislation (the designation of favourable condition of protected species and habitats) is a potential barrier to working with natural processes to conserve/restore biodiversity and ecosystem services. Research could seek to identify whether some species should protected because of their important function within ecosystems rather than based on their rarity. This could be a way of assessing favourable condition of ecological processes. There is a need to experiment to determine when and where different types of rewilding could be useful. 

Next Steps: Invite Paul to the Rewilding in the Uplands workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd6874aa5bc2.93537838</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Submitted evidence to Environmental Audit Committee enquiry into 'The Future of the Natural Environment after the EU referendum'</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE8FF54B-7E7A-4980-8EDE-97B3720A06BA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7cd5048ab74.81275544</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/WrittenEvidence/CommitteeEvidence.svc/EvidenceDocument/Environmental%20Audit/The%20Future%20of%20the%20Natural%20Environment%20after%20the%20EU%20Referendum/written/37496.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation and contribution to the POST-note on Rewilding and Ecosystem Services</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F2D581C5-2D7E-4CF2-8D96-E963D9C1E2C3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ccbbdbe259.34555532</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS7sWZ6tXSAhVMIMAKHejaCpYQFggiMAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fresearchbriefings.files.parliament.uk%2Fdocuments%2FPOST-PN-0537%2FPOST-PN-0537.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHJKnx7ipOOiEZTAqHoCStFzpBE8Q&amp;sig2=NDQBWGlzZWoIcyQt6xxI1w</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P005926/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5020ECC8-E0E8-434D-BDD5-663A9C04EFA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E03855F0-1A26-4F21-8789-578E6A9BAC49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape  Architecture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>99C0726F-47B0-4500-8B73-4DD0C60E31DF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Water Quality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
