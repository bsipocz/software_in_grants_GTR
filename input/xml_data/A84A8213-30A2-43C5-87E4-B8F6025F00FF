The competition between companies in markets is regarded as the quintessential element of the British economy. However, this depiction of the British model overlooks the fact that employers cooperate in important ways with each other to gain collaborative advantages for their businesses. This project focuses on the collaboration of British businesses in EOs. These EOs focus on the role of businesses as employers and they are concerned with a variety of aspects related to work and employment relations. These EOs include traditional employers' associations, but also new types of EO that have emerged over the last decade such as employers' forums and collective employer bodies that focus on training and corporate social responsibility. Even though a wide range of EO activities can be observed, there has been barely any research on the contemporary role of British EOs. This project aims to address this research gap. 
 
The project will analyse the various role and activities of EOs. These offer services and represent the interests of their members, which includes providing legal assistance, coordinating and organising joint training initiatives, lobbying government, conducting collective bargaining, providing assistance in implementing government policies and drafting up codes of conduct. These activities of EOs provide collaborative advantages for their members For example, EOs provide services or coordinate training programme cost-effectively for their members. This is particularly advantageous for smaller companies that do not have separate HRM or legal departments. EOs help companies avoid business risks, e.g. the infringement of equality and diversity laws. Effective implementation of legislation in cooperation with EOs contributes to building sustainable businesses. In addition, EOs self-regulate and develop code of conducts for businesses in order to avoid regulation by the government. Beyond examining the various activities of EOs, the project will also assess the wider impact of the work of EOs for stakeholders in society such as employees, labour unions and the government. 
 
In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of EOs in the UK, the project will conduct in-depth empirical research using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The project seeks to discover all EOs in the UK, compile a comprehensive database and collect key information on each EO (e.g. activities, function, members, governance and services). The project will also identify different types of EOs, which might include employers' forums, traditional employer associations, public sector EOs and collective employer bodies focusing on training. Case studies will be carried out on each type of EO, in order to achieve a more fine-grained understanding of their work and functioning. Additionally, the project will conduct surveys of members of key EOs and analyse the relationship between EOS and their member businesses. 
 
The project will establish a close collaboration with EOs. Research findings and good practices of EOs will be widely disseminated through publications in practitioner magazines and academic journals, an edited book, presentations to EOs themselves and an international practitioner-academic conference at Cardiff Business School in 2015. In addition, the project will create the first web page with a focus on EOs. The web page will provide useful information and research outcomes to all interested stakeholders, including businesses, staff of EOs, employees, politicians and the wider public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will significantly benefit a number of different audiences, including businesses, EOs, employees, government and the wider public. The various activities for reaching the different beneficiaries are detailed in the Pathways to Impact document, this section focuses on explaining how different users would benefit from this research. 
 
Businesses. This research project will explain how EOs produce collaborative advantages for businesses. Such advantages include: The provision of services by EOs might be more cost effective and reliable for businesses compared to market-based solutions. Coordinated training initiatives jointly may reduce costs and contribute to a steady supply of skilled employees. Self-organise employee relations through EOs might help to avoid more heavy handed government regulations. Representing interests of employers jointly might be more powerful than individual interest representation. Implementing legislation with the support of EOs might help to avert business risks as violation of laws can be costly. However, these are merely hypotheses and there is no systematic research on the role of EOs currently. Exploring and analysing the role of EOs and communicating the findings widely to the business community will demonstrate to employers how they can use EOs to build competitive and sustainable enterprises. 
 
Employers' Organisations. This project will be undertaken with the cooperation of EOs. The various dissemination and engagement strategies will ensure that mutual learning can take place and research findings are communicated to EOs. The project aims to identify good practices. However, the project will not simply prescribe best practices, as the strategies of EOs will differ, but it will aim to facilitate a dialogue about improving practices within the EO population and between EO practitioners and academics. The international academic-practitioner conference will be organised in the same spirit: to facilitate learning and exchange across borders. 
 
Employees and Labour Unions. EOs crucially shape and influence work and employee relations; for example EOs develop social codes of conduct, implement corporate social responsibility strategies, undertake collective bargaining, organise training initiatives and influence the government's regulation of work and employment relations. As employees and labour unions are affected by these activities, they will be interested in learning more about the work of EOs. 
 
Government. Governments have different instruments at hand to organise the economy. In some instances governments facilitate market-based coordination and solutions, but sometimes the regulation of economic activities is more appropriate. The self-regulation of associations such as EOs provides an alternative pathway between markets and government regulation. Effective self-regulation can relieve governments from regulating a potentially complex area of society. Thus, it will be beneficial for policy makers to further understand how EOs shape work and employment relations and how self-regulation can be improved. 
 
Public. This research seeks to explain how businesses gain collaborative advantages by cooperating in EOs. This suggests that markets are not necessarily always the superior mode to organise economic activities as is widely assumed, instead the research aims to specify under which condition collaboration and collective action can produce positive and beneficial outcomes for the economy and society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250758</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organizing Stream at SASE conference 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>84FE8A4C-BEB6-4862-B045-231D07D3DB84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organized a conference stream (mini-conference) on employers' organisations at the SASE conference in 2015. 17 papers were presented in this stream.

Professor Cathie Jo Martin, Professor of Political Science at Boston University, is one of the keynote speakers. Professor Martin is a former chair of the Council for European Studies and specialises in the relationship between business and social policy.

The conference will focus on employers' collective action and organisation which is an established, but also growing, feature of business systems. In many countries employers' associations continue to set industry-wide terms and conditions through collective bargaining with trade unions. In other contexts, where industry bargaining has collapsed, long-established employers' associations continue to exist but with a different function and purpose. In these cases, training initiatives and delivery of services to member firms have grown in importance.

Other employer and business organisations lobby governments with the aim of influencing employment and labour policies while recent decades have seen the emergence of new forms of employers' organisations. These are single issue organisations which focus on CSR and equality and diversity.

While employer organisations are well established, and the range of their activities is broad, collective action by employers is an underexplored area. The ambition of this conference is therefore to extend theoretical and empirical understanding of this significant yet neglected institutions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6d9dea1e900.00291411</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://business.cardiff.ac.uk/news/conference-examines-employer-collective-action</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop 'Employers and Their Collective Organisations in Contemporary Capitalism'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D5F6F415-EE86-4C82-82C2-37A10BF4977A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop took place on March 24, 2015 at Cardiff Business School.
