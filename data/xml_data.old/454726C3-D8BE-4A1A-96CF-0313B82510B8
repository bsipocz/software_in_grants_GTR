For example, one may be interested in studying spillovers and externalities in technology diffusion across firms and industries, or impacts of friendship networks on the educational outcomes of students. There has been a growing interest in the discipline of economics to account for such interdependence via explicit economic modelling. Interactions between agents arise naturally in most social and economic research that often influence decisions taken by governments and firms. Ignoring such interactions in empirical analysis when they are in fact present would lead to misleading findings and poor prediction accuracy. Recognising this has led to new developments in both theoretical modelling and statistical techniques. In particular, spatial econometrics, the field that develops methodological tools to study or allow for such interactions, has witnessed rapid advancements. 

While the idea of interdependence between economic agents is highly intuitive, quantitative modelling requires explicit mathematical formulations of such relationships, inevitably imbuing some degree of arbitrariness into any given analysis. Practitioners typically face uncertainty about many, if not all, aspects of model specification and the current absence of testing methodology to detect model misspecification undermines confidence in the reliability of subsequent econometric analysis. This project aims to produce much-needed testing procedures to assess correct specification of models, which is a crucial assumption made in theoretical econometric works to obtain validity of existing estimation and inferential methods. Such testing methods will be a major advancement to the field. 

We aim to establish solid theoretical foundation for a ground-breaking development of specification testing procedures in a spatial setting, and to produce user-friendly automated codes that implement our tests in popular software programs used by empirical researchers. To do so, we will rely on an existing work of PI, Co-I and P.C.B. Phillips, and extend its results to continue developing testing procedures in spatial models, which present significant challenges. Careful theoretical studies need to be undertaken to refine the tests to optimise the power properties. 

The main benefits of our research would be helping practitioners avoid inconsistent estimates and misleading conclusions arising from fitting misspecified models and also achieve more accurate forecasts of future outcomes. This is crucial as fitting different models to the same data could often lead to contrasting findings, hence selecting the right model is of paramount importance in empirical research. Our procedures will help practitioners choose among competing models and will have practical implications via improving the quality of econometric analysis and prediction on which policy recommendations and decisions taken by governments and the private sector are based. The applicability of spatial econometrics and our methodologies extends well beyond economics to other social sciences, such as regional science, urban planning, quantitative geography, environmental studies and mathematical social network (in fact, researchers from these disciples actively contribute to developments in spatial econometrics). These are fields that generate and foster active interdisciplinary research and have major policy impacts.

Our testing procedures can and should become a routine and integral part of any spatial econometric applications, as practitioners are inclined to test the critical assumption of correct specification that underpins the validity of their findings. To this end, the creation and dissemination of automated codes will play a critical role. Given the complexity of this task, the research assistance in coding we apply for as part of this grant is crucial for the success of the project</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main non-academic beneficiaries of this project will be economic analysts at government agencies, central banks, international organizations such as IMF and World Bank, and in private sector, for example those working on forecasts of house prices and housing demand at banks and building societies. These practitioners carry out empirical research to produce evidence-based policy assessment, forecast future economic variables and simulate contrasting policy outcomes based on insights into the real world gained from statistical analysis of data. Their works influence policy recommendations and decisions taken by governments and private sector. 
Spatial econometric techniques enable practitioners to incorporate possible interdependence between countries, regions, firms and individuals into their empirical analysis. There is a growing recognition of the need for such spatial modelling in wider research community outside academia, see e.g. ECB working papers by Ozyurt and coauthors (2014, 2015), IMF working papers Baldacci et al. (2011) and Silver and Graf (2014) and working papers of Millo and coauthors (2011, 2014) of Generali group, the third biggest insurance firm in the world. Failing to account for these interactions when they are in fact present would lead to misleading findings arising from biased/inconsistent estimates and poorer forecast performance. Ozyurt (2014) of ECB enumerates a large number of recent real-estate studies which &amp;quot;show that the incorporation of the observed spatial relationship improves the accuracy of the predicted market values and time indicators&amp;quot;. 
To date, theoretical justifications for estimation and inference procedures in spatial econometric models all rely crucially on the strong assumption that the model is correctly specified. Confidence in subsequent analysis is undermined by the lack of testing procedure to assess this key assumption. The present project fills this hole in the current set of available techniques. This will enable practitioners to make better-informed model specification, generate greater confidence in the validity of subsequent econometric analysis and improve precision of forecasts. 
For example, understanding of house price movement is enhanced by accounting for interdependence between houses within and across different neighbourhoods. While this idea is highly intuitive, formal modelling of such interaction requires the practitioner to choose mathematical forms of such relation and also how determinants of house price other than that of neighbouring units affect the outcome, which inevitably are subject to arbitrariness. The present project will produce the much-needed testing procedures to assess whether the model specification being used is acceptable in the light of data. Such testing is crucial in any application of spatial econometric techniques.
As with any emerging academic field, it takes time and resources for academic advancement to seep through to wider community. The leading initiatives for dissemination in this field are Spatial Econometric Association's (SEA) annual 4-week summer schools for practitioners and graduate students and its annual conference which attracts heavy participation from practitioners. We are already in touch with the SEA about our research and possible collaboration in future to effectively disseminate the project's output given its synergy with the existing methodology of inference and estimation. By joining forces with these exiting efforts, this project will contribute to the process via offering a key advancement to the field of overcoming one of its most severe current limitations. We therefore anticipate the project's impacts will long outlive its duration.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>233556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P011705/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A4E8C76-15D3-44F2-9A84-72ADCE4DC97D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econometrics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF887C15-B29F-4C4C-8420-88AF17A8FFE1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Financial economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
