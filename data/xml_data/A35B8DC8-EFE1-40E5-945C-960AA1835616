expression</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/K008021/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>A relatively small number of genes can react rapidly to changes in and around the cell and regulate other genes to coordinate an appropriate cellular response. These master control genes are very important for medicine as their misregulation is often involved in diseases such as cancer, asthma and stroke. In addition, a similar rapid change in the activity of genes is required for the production of proteins for medical and industrial applications. 

Because the master control genes also need to be able to turn off quickly, their products have to be degraded fast. However, this creates a problem, as it is hard to accumulate sufficient product if it degrades quickly (if someone is eating your pancakes as quickly you bake them, you never get any yourself). We have recently shown that a modification to the gene product allows a delay before degradation occurs, making it possible to both accumulate product and remove it quickly (if you agree that pancake eating only starts after everyone, including you, is at the table, a pile of pancakes can accumulate and then be removed even faster). 

In this project, we will measure this delay during the stimulation of cell growth with growth factor and determine if it indeed plays such a big role. We will investigate which genes use a delayed decay and what causes differences in the delay between genes. Interestingly, we found that a compound from the traditional medicinal mushroom Cordyceps, cordycepin, reduced the activity of many master control genes for inflammation and cell growth. It inhibits the process that causes delay in decay of their products, which may explain how the drug works. We therefore want to find out if cordycepin indeed works this way and if it is a good candidate for a novel class of cancer drugs (by inhibiting mostly growth factor activated genes) or if it has effects on too many other genes, which would lead to nasty side effects.

Our findings will be important for the understanding of the regulation of master control genes and are therefore likely to benefit medical research and the industrial production of proteins. The work on cordycepin may ultimately lead to new medicines for cancer and inflammatory disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Rapid and transient transcriptional induction is a property of a small number of important regulatory genes involved in processes such as inflammation, cell proliferation and cellular stress. Such induced mRNAs must be unstable, because otherwise they persist beyond the transcriptional pulse. Using mathematical modelling, we have shown for the first time that the existing model for mRNA degradation, exponential decay, gives a poor mRNA pulse. In our delayed decay model, the delay caused by first deadenylating an mRNA causes a big improvement in induction. A transcription pulse timed to match the delay gives optimal transient regulation. We also show that, contrary to the standard texbooks, not all mRNAs receive a poly(A) tail of a similar size, indicating that the delay can be regulated both by adenosine addition and removal. We show that the poly(A) tails of growth factor induced mRNAs indeed change during induction. We therefore propose that the poly(A) tail plays a major role in the efficiency of transcriptional regulation.

In this project, we wil investigate the synthesis, decay, polyadenylation and deadenylation of constitutive and growth factor induced mRNAs to investigate the importance of the deadenylation delay for the expression of different classes of genes. We will use methods recently developed in our laboratory and others, including 4-thiouridine labelling to determine mRNA stability, PCR based poly(A) tests on thiouridine labelled RNA, siRNA knockdown of factors and treatment with cordycepin to disrupt the delay machinery, and reporter assays using inducible genes with fused sequences that potentially regulate the delay by influencing polyadenylation or deadenylation.

This work will make a major contribution to the fundamental understanding of the regulation of gene expression. It may ultimately contribute to novel cancer and anti-inflammatory therapy, as well as to improved transgene design for the biotech industry.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The major result of this work will be a change in the fundamental understanding of the regulation of gene expression. Soon after publication of the work, this understanding will impact nearly all areas of biology, medicine, agriculture and biotechnology where the regulation of gene expression is studied, this includes both academic and industrial research. 

In industry, the potential of drugs targeting the polyadenylation machinery for cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs is already creating some interest, and we expect that this project will make this research really take off, generating work in the pharmaceutical industry and perhaps leading to marketable drugs and larger economic impact in the long term (5-10 years after the project end). In addition, the knowledge acquired is likely to lead to better recombinant genes for the expression of proteins of commercial interest, increasing the productivity of transgenic cells and organisms (within 5 years after the project end). 

In 15 years, this research could lead to improved therapy for a variety of diseases, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, both through the development of drugs targeting the polyadenylation machinery and through improved understanding of the causes of disease.

This project is a unique training opportunity for two researchers to reach in depth understanding of computational molecular biology, an area where there is a great shortage of expertise both in academia and industry. At least one of these researchers is therefore likely to have a long term successful career in this area and benefit industry or academia for the coming 40 years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>545040</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Potsdam</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Polyadenylation in plants</gtr:description><gtr:id>59C2624F-D4FF-4691-ABA2-A772A63541C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A publication has resulted (Kappel et al.)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546cc19232bd11.05047497-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Most of the research is done by the partners, we provide expertise and help with looking at poly(A) tails</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We trained a student in our method for poly(A) fractionation and the collaborators used this to study poly(A) tail changes in plants.

We started a collaboration with Prof. Vicky Chapman of the Arthritis UK Pain Center, leading to the discovery that the polyadenylation inhibitor cordycepin is an effective analgesic in a rat model of osteoarthritis. Arthritis Research UK has now funded a project grant to investigate cordycepin as a drug lead. This work is likely to lead to new therapy for osteoarthritis and perhaps chronic pain in general in a relatively short timespan. The award from Arthritis Research UK was widely picked up by the press and featured in national newspapers as well as the local BBC news.

A new avenue that we are exploring is the question of why Cordyceps fungi make anti-inflammatory compounds. A potential explanation is that the fungus uses them to suppress the insect immune system during infection. In collaboration with Dr. David Chandler (University of Warwick), we are investigating if cordycepin enhances fungal infection rates in insects. This could lead to improved effectiveness of fungi as natural pesticides.

In April last year, we had the first meeting of the Cordycepin Consortium, which included crop scientists, clinicians (oncology, respiratory disease, arthritis), medicinal chemists and distributors of Cordyceps food supplements. 

In addition, we hosted a summer school for 6 (2014) and 8 (2015) secondary school students aged 15-18. They actively participated in the research in our laboratory for a week and all stated that they were very motivated to study biological sciences as a consequence.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>05CADA9D-1570-49F5-ABFC-21CA697FB391</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545ba8e7b943e7.05233825</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our data indicate that polyadenylation, the last step in the synthesis of mRNAs, is much more regulated than we previously thought. We found that polyadenylation is especially important for the very fast regulation of gene expression that happens when tissues are responding to damage or infection. This has led to another project in which we are testing if inhibition of polyadenylation can reduce the consequences of defective tissue repair in a model of osteoarthritis.

We have developed a number of new methods for measuring and calculating mRNA stability and polyadenylation in the last stages of this grant that are likely to be helpful to other researchers in the field.

Here are our outcomes by the original aims of the project:

Aim 1:Preparing the system. 
We did not attempt to find a growth factor replacement for the serum stimulation (see reasons below). We did characterise the thioUTP levels in cells and this work is included in a manuscript that is currently under review.

Aim 2: Measuring and modelling kinetics of mRNA accumulation during the GF response
We had done some initial modelling to determine the number of measurements needed to distinguish between our mathematical models of mRNA synthesis and decay using thiouridine labelled and total RNA, but a more detailed analysis by the mathematical researcher on the project, Graeme Thorn, indicated we needed a decay as well as an accumulation phase for accurate modelling. As this would considerably increase the number of samples required for RNAseq (and the cost), we opted for an initial study of serum response genes in total RNA to test the models and measure poly(A) tails over time. This led to novel insights in the function of the poly(A) tail and to the discovery that the intial poly(A) tail size is regulated during the serum response. This work has been submitted for publication, but because our work changes concepts that have been in the textbook for years, we're being asked to provide large numbers of additional controls, which have taken a lot of time.

To we used a time course of thiouridine labeling of RNA, which allows for isolation of the accumulated newly made RNA, followed by a washout period to generate a synthesis and decay profile. RNAseq was performed on thiouridine labelled and total RNA over 9 time points, allowing us to study thousands of mRNAs, including constitutively expressed ones. We are currently preparing this work for publication.

Aim 3: Measuring and modelling of poly(A) tails during the GF response
As described above, we were successful in developing methods to measure initial poly(A) tail size of individual mRNAs and this has been submitted for publication. In addition, during the project, several publications came out describing high throughput methods for measuring poly(A) tail size and our discovery that poly(A) tail size is regulated in the nucleus made it highly desirable to measure poly(A) tail size in newly made and/or nuclear RNA. However, the existing methods were not up to this challenge. During this project, we made a start with developing our own improved method and are now continuing this development in collaboration with the Babraham Institute.

Aim 4: Determinaton of poly(A) metabolic factor requirements for the GF response
We did an extensive siRNA screen to determine which polyadenylation factors could be involved in the regulation of initial poly(A) tail length. Frustratingly, nearly all the factors that had an effect primarily caused a down regulation of transcription of the serum response genes, indicating there is a very tight coupling between transcription induction and increased polyadenylation. This clearly needs a more extensive investigation. A BBSRC PhD student (Kathryn Willams) is continuing this work.

Aim 5: Determination of sequences required differential poly(A) metabolism and GF response
Because the challenges of measuring initial poly(A) tails to the standards required by the reviewers of our first paper submission and the investments we made in developing a high throughput method for poly(A) tail measurement, this part of the study was not completed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are hoping that our work will be used to develop novel medicines for cancer, inflammatory disease and degenerative diseases.
