Electronic Corpus of Tyneside English</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/H037691/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The increasingly widespread use of Information Technology (IT) in most spheres of human activity since the mid-20th century has facilitated &amp;amp; continues to generate digital electronic natural language text/audio/graphics on a huge scale. Arts &amp;amp; Humanities (A&amp;amp;H) research has benefitted from this in that the volume of such materials available for study has greatly increased. Moreover, other fields like Statistics, Information Retrieval &amp;amp; Data Mining have provided computational tools for analysis/interpretation of data abstracted from these A&amp;amp;H resources. A major aspect of the impact of IT &amp;amp; allied subject areas on A&amp;amp;H research has been the creation of discipline-specific collections via digitisation of legacy materials or synthesis of these with new ones. After several decades' activity, the volume of such collections both in the UK &amp;amp; worldwide is both very large &amp;amp; showing no sign of receding. \nAs the number of domain-specific collections has grown, a variety of conceptual/technical issues having to do with the preservation/re-use of such resources have arisen. \n\nThe AHRC's DEDEFI call focuses on two of them: \n(i) Given that such collections are typically generated in academic environments for academic use &amp;amp; resourced by public funding bodies, how can one ensure their longevity so that the financial/human investment in them is not wasted, i.e. how can they be made sustainable?\n(ii) How can the potential of the collections be extended beyond HE to schools/museums &amp;amp; to the general public, that is, how can they achieve even greater social impact?\n\nThe present application addresses these two issues with respect to an existing AHRC-funded collection, the 'Newcastle Electronic Corpus of Tyneside English' (NECTE) (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/necte). NECTE amalgamated two legacy databases of Tyneside English, the 'Tyneside Linguistic Survey' &amp;amp; the 'Phonological Variation &amp;amp; Change in Contemporary Spoken English' project, into a single resource. This process conformed to global standards for the documentation/digitisation of such data &amp;amp; was undertaken using the latest IT technology available. NECTE was intended primarily as a resource for academic linguistic/socio-historical research. Since its publication on the Web in 2005, it has been extensively used both by its creators &amp;amp; by other researchers for that purpose. \n\nThis proposal aims to develop NECTE in ways that enhance both its sustainability and impact. In overview, the objective is to augment the corpus content in several respects &amp;amp; to create a new website that supersedes the existing one &amp;amp; makes the content more accessible to academic/non-academic users in ways appropriate to these respective communities. The augmentation comprises updating to the current global documentation standards, linking the corpus with recently collected/digitised Tyneside speech (2007-2009) as well as digitized photographic materials from collections at Beamish (http://www.beamishcollections.com/rrc/photo.asp), the Northern Region Film &amp;amp; TV Archive (http://www.nrfta.org.uk/) &amp;amp; Tyne &amp;amp; Wear Museums &amp;amp; Archives (http://www.tyneandweararchives.org.uk/).\nFor academic users, the new website offers download facilities &amp;amp; documentation that are essentially identical to those of the existing NECTE website, though the latter would be updated to reflect new standards &amp;amp; the changes to the content already described. For non-academic users (especially those in the educational/museum sectors), the website offers topic-based browsing of the resource such that, selecting different menus will present the user with linked audio/text/photographic data. By doing so, we will meet the challenge of preserving/enhancing the value of the Linguistic 'Time Capsule' that is NECTE by using state-of-the-art technologies to accommodate the quite distinctive web searching behaviours &amp;amp; demands of the 'Google Generation' (Kuiper et al. 2008;Nicholas &amp;amp; Rowlands 2008).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal impacts on the UK's society &amp;amp; economy by 'enhancing quality of life &amp;amp; creative output', &amp;amp; more specifically by (i) 'providing innovative content &amp;amp; support for the creative and cultural industries, working in partnership with museums, galleries, and other cultural organisations', and (ii) by engagement with school curricula. The aim is to promote community cohesion/social inclusion by fostering awareness of shared history and of cultural/linguistic identity in the Tyneside area.\n\n(I) WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?\nDECTE is designed to impact upon:\n-Academics involved in the project, their students &amp;amp; the linguistics research community more generally (academic benefits are explicitly described in the relevant section of Je-S).\n-Primary/Secondary/FE educators &amp;amp; students.\n-The museum/cultural heritage sectors &amp;amp; the general public.\n\n(II) HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?\n2.1 The DECTE team/Advisory Board &amp;amp; the linguistics research community more generally:\n-The DECTE team and Advisory Board gain by: (i) forging links between non-academic &amp;amp; academic constituencies; (ii) expanding their experience of/acquiring skills in KT/CPD &amp;amp; (iii) by ensuring sustainability of a corpus to which two of the collaborators have already devoted considerable research effort, yielding them international reputations in corpus linguistics.\n-Netskills enhances its existing experience of &amp;amp; reputation in the provision of Web-based training materials for the Museums, Libraries &amp;amp; Archives, and Schools sectors. \n-The academic community gains an enhanced corpus for research.\n\n2.2 Primary/Secondary/FE educators &amp;amp; students:\nStudents/teachers gain access to an IT resource designed for use across the primary/secondary curriculum, providing:\n-Familiarity with &amp;amp; provision of teaching materials related to local linguistic/cultural heritage.\n-Awareness of the link between the historical development of the North East &amp;amp; its distinctive dialect.\n-CPD opportunities in English Language for teachers without formal qualifications in the subject.\n\n2.3 The museum/cultural heritage sectors &amp;amp; the general public:\nThe museum &amp;amp; cultural heritage industries gain access to a resource configurable for a variety of exhibition formats relating to Tyneside history, language &amp;amp; culture. Because the general public is the primary consumer of such exhibitions, the visitor experience will be enhanced. \n\n(III) ENSURING BENEFITS FROM THIS RESEARCH:\nBenefits are ensured by the ethical conduct of the project &amp;amp; implementation of copyright/IPR agreements between the project team, consultants &amp;amp; collaborating partners with respect to corpus/website creation &amp;amp; access. Additionally, the following communication &amp;amp; engagement plans are proposed as timetabled:\n\n-Teachers in secondary education\nThe A-level conferences we have run successfully for the last 2 years have provided a forum for exchange between teachers at secondary &amp;amp; tertiary levels. The next conference in March 2010 will consult teachers on our plans for DECTE &amp;amp; pilot ideas for a related CPD workshop in December 2010. We will use our mailing list of 148 schools across the country, our blog &amp;amp; relevant 3rd-party websites to (i) disseminate information about &amp;amp; invite feedback on DECTE &amp;amp; (ii) advertise the CPD workshop &amp;amp; curriculum materials. \n\n-Students in secondary education\nUsing the above contacts, we will run workshops &amp;amp; conferences on DECTE, targeting a variety of learner groups. These activities are planned at strategic intervals to gain feedback on DECTE as a learning resource.\n\n-Museum &amp;amp; cultural heritage sectors &amp;amp; the general public\nEvents involving DECTE are planned in conjunction with local museums &amp;amp; cultural groups: Newcastle Discovery, Beamish, Tyne and Wear Museums &amp;amp; Archives. DECTE will be launched at a Newcastle University public lecture &amp;amp; the project website blog will follow t</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>185037</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Durham University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Encounters Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>C179A9F1-73FE-4ACB-A2D5-E9F1FF486999</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b95a440cb95a442a-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Between 2006 and 2009, Trevor Wishart (http://www.trevorwishart.co.uk) was the Arts Council of England Composer-in-Residence at Durham University.

It focused on the rich linguistic and literary heritage of the North East of England. There is a general perception in the rest of the British Isles that the North East is synonymous with 'Geordie', and that one dialect speaker from the area will therefore sound pretty much like another, no matter which part of the region they're from. Fortunately, the North East has been the focus of quite a lot of dialect research that shows how wrong this is, identifying some of the language features that distinguish different parts of the region. In this talk we discussed some of these differences. We also explored how other parts of the region, such as the border areas of northern Durham, seem to show a mix of features. Having thought a bit about the language, we then considered the ways in which leading local poets, like Tommy Armstrong and Basil Bunting, used the distinctive voice of their region to depict so vividly life in the North East. The talk went down really well and there was a lot of lively discussion and debate. Subsequent reports from The Stanley Education Centre suggest that the event really got people thinking about the relationship between dialect and literary works of the region.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b01d73028646.81604137</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Talk of the Toon: The Diachronic Electronic Corpus of Tyneside English</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F5E0DA66-521F-40DD-914B-6280F5ABF8B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented at the Vitae Yorkshire and North East Hub Public Engagement Competition (Pecha Kucha), Durham Town Hall, 6th April 2011.

Arts &amp;amp; Humanities (A&amp;amp;H) research has benefitted from this in that the volume of such materials available for study has greatly increased. Moreover, other fields like Statistics, Information Retrieval &amp;amp; Data Mining have provided computational tools for analysis/

interpretation of data abstracted from these A&amp;amp;H resources. A major aspect of the impact of IT &amp;amp; allied subject areas on A&amp;amp;H research has been the creation of discipline-specific collections via digitization of legacy materials or synthesis of these with new ones. 



As the number of domain-specific collections has grown, a variety of conceptual/technical issues having to do with the preservation/re-use of such resources have arisen. The AHRC's DEDEFI call focused on two of them: (i) Given that such collections are typically generated in academic environments for academic use &amp;amp; resourced by public funding bodies, how can one ensure their sustainability? (ii) How can they achieve even greater social impact?



&amp;quot;A Linguistic 'Time-Capsule' for the Google Generation: The Diachronic Electronic Corpus of Tyneside English&amp;quot; (DECTE) project addressed these two issues with respect to an existing AHRC-funded collection, the &amp;quot;Newcastle Electronic Corpus of Tyneside English&amp;quot; (NECTE) (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/necte). NECTE amalgamated two legacy databases of Tyneside English and this process conformed to global standards for the documentation/digitisation of such data &amp;amp; was undertaken using the latest IT technology available. NECTE was intended primarily as a resource for academic linguistic/socio-historical research. Since its publication on the Web in 2005, it has been extensively used both by its creators &amp;amp; by other researchers for that purpose.



The DECTE initiative (2010-2012) developed these resources in ways that enhanced both their sustainability and impact. In overview, the objective was to augment the corpus content in several respects &amp;amp; to create a new website that superseded the existing one &amp;amp; made the content more accessible to academic/non-academic users in ways appropriate to these respective communities. The augmentation comprised updating to the current global documentation standards, linking the corpus with recently collected/digitized Tyneside speech (2007-2009) as well as digitized photographic materials from collections at Beamish (http://www.beamishcollections.com/rrc/photo.asp) and the Northern Region Film &amp;amp; TV Archive (http://www.nrfta.org.uk/).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>For non-academic users (especially those in the educational/museum sectors), we have created another website called &amp;quot;Talk of the Toon&amp;quot; (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/decte/toon) which offers topic-based browsing of the resource such that, selecting different menus presents the user with linked audio/text/still and moving image data. By doing so, we have met the challenge of preserving/enhancing the value of the Linguistic 'Time Capsule' that is DECTE by using state-of-the-art technologies to accommodate the quite distinctive web searching behaviours &amp;amp; demands of the 'Google Generation' (Kuiper et al. 2008; Nicholas &amp;amp; Rowlands 2008).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4D4E0C0E-3818-4A7A-84B3-75693F89DFE4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1800528514.94450977638500</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ncl.ac.uk/decte/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>DECTE is an amalgamation of the existing Newcastle Electronic Corpus of Tyneside English (NECTE) created between 2001 and 2005 (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/necte), via an AHRC Resource Enhancement Award, and NECTE2, a collection of interviews conducted in the Tyneside area since 2007. It thereby constitutes a rare example of a publicly available on-line corpus presenting dialect material spanning five decades.
The present website is designed for research use.
