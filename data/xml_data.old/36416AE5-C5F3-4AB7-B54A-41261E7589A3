My intention (see 'main objectives') is to facilitate a university-based writing initiative which embraces diverse forms of theatre and performance writing, is non-hierarchical and is driven by conceptual and formal enquiry. I will subsequently discuss and analyse the process and its outcomes as an example of emerging dramaturgical practice.\n\nOutline\n\nSeven writers and myself will each contribute ideas towards an initial weekend devoted to discussing conceptual questions surrounding narrative in the 21st century theatre. What kinds of stories are possible? Is narrative a problem? What interesting approaches currently exist and what might be conceived? What are the difficulties or possibilities inherent in theatrical conventions of representation, including character, situation and dialogue? The subject has been chosen in response to an observed fascination with narrative structures and the process of story production in new work of recent years. \n\nWriters will be encouraged to look beyond their own immediate projects in order to bring influences, stimuli, anecdotes and performance practices to share with others. A writer may bring a literary work (not necessarily dramatic), a workshop, a film, a question for discussion or some other thought-provoking contribution. Each will run a short session - about one hour each. \n\nTwo professional dramaturgs will be invited to observe the weekend, in order to consider its potential for informing dramaturgical practice. However, it is hoped that all those attending, including myself, will participate as writers in the first instance, engaged in offering provocations and creating work together. For this reason, the dramaturgs invited to attend will be selected partly because they also have their own artistic practice.\n\nAt the end of the first weekend, participants will each be invited to write a short performance text in response to the various discussions and stimuli. They will be encouraged to try out new ideas and to take risks, rather than to try to write something that is necessarily 'successful' and complete. Collaborations are possible. Experimental approaches will be positively encouraged.\n\nThese texts will be analysed and staged by students on the 'Dramaturgy' module at the University of Winchester and where writers desire, there is the possibility of working together with students to generate or revise text. Students will be encouraged to think about the offers that a text makes and to make creative responses in their staging. In other words, there will be a sense of fluid exchange with students, rather than an expectation that the performers are there to serve the writers.\n\nThe writers will meet again for one day, to view the performances of these texts. There will then be a discussion of the work and ideas that arise, followed by a separate discussion of the project and the potential development of 'Writing Space'.\n\nOutcomes and dissemination\n\nThe project has two sets of outcomes. My own principle objective, as outlined previously, is to analyse the process, examining its actual and potential contribution to the development of new writing. However, eight experimental, work-in-progress texts will also be produced as a result of the project and will form part of its documentation.\n\nThe project findings will be disseminated via a report on the 'Writernet' website and the 'Space Between Words' website, at a conference for the Literary Managers' Forum, and at a conference held by Space Between Words, also in 2008. An article will also be submitted to a peer reviewed journal. Written documentation, including photographs, will be distributed to all those involved in the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-07-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12940</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Commissioned performance text, performed by students</gtr:description><gtr:id>A07BE71A-1E06-4A90-A75F-9382CE13D28B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-1505615153.8208268a712da2e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Please Forward to Hans-Thies Lehmann - by Steve Waters</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Commissioned extract of community play, performed by students</gtr:description><gtr:id>B397ADDD-DD03-49C9-97EF-D0BEC3A13EB9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact on the subsequent development of the community play was reported.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-3391626685.2911806a712cc64</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Commotion Time - extract - by Sarah Dickenson</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Commissioned text, performed by students</gtr:description><gtr:id>9198915C-7C1F-4DEC-9D10-695AF93D3AA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bennett went on to develop this work further, drawing on it to create subsequent work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-2632233447.052756a71351a2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Dog, by Emma Bennett</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Commissioned performance text, performed by students.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4790EF15-9B99-4AF7-ABEA-5FC07F430BE9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-8537958058.098291a70dbc56</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Kind Regards, Leanne  by Tanya Ronder</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Commissionied performance text, performed by students</gtr:description><gtr:id>7B06C530-39AB-4D88-BF03-458C043D12EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MacDonald wrote about this piece subsequently, in the special issue of STP, related to the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-7239717615.060245a7133adc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>In Bed - by Claire MacDonald</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Commissioned performance text, performed by students</gtr:description><gtr:id>A32C9EE4-577E-421F-8EA9-89A70044985A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-9696056619.003468a713fed6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Prompt, by Michael Pinchbeck</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Commissioned performance text, performed by the author</gtr:description><gtr:id>B4E6FBC9-8034-4323-AC87-077C55B44DF1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Makishi went on to draw on this piece of work in creating a further performance in other contexts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-5855644350.737002a713e932</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>How Can I Show You My Love? by Stacy Makishi</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>New performance text, performed by students.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DA80513E-B2FA-40BA-B50D-55A09E0CEF82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This piece took inspiration from Elinor Fuchs' essay 'Visit to a small planet', and subsequently led to communication with her, and meeting in 2010.

Feedback gathered from participants confirmed their sense of its usefulness to their creative practice. The texts were compiled as part of a special issue of Studies in Theatre and Performance, to provide a useful teaching resource. I have received personal communications suggesting that these and other publications have been useful to teaching and research elsewhere.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5E829C3E-345E-420A-AFD1-0759CD653EE0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544108669dfef3.89540771</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project demonstrated the potential for developing new writing through exchange between writers whose work is dissimilar in terms of form, aesthetic and process.

Key findings suggested the fruitfulness of this approach, often producing unexpected revelations about individual work and resolving anxieties about the creative process by suggesting completely new perspectives. It was also interesting to see writers exchanging ideas and themes across works commissioned out of the same process, suggesting that writing might be a more social activity than commonly supposed, without being 'collaborative' in an obvious sense. 

These findings led me to propose a 'radically inclusive' dramaturgy, which would embrace all forms of performative writing, including, but not privileging the play text. I also proposed that the more social understanding of the writer's work might inflect assumptions about a writer's needs and process.

The project process offered an alternative model to the 'rehearsed reading', which could be viable elsewhere. It is difficult to establish to what extent this innovation played its part in encouraging expanded approaches to dramaturgical work with writers, although this now appears less unusual than it did in 2008.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This offers a potential model for literary management to adopt in terms of new writing schemes, or for writer's groups to adapt to enable links and conversations with other kinds of writers and theatre/performance makers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>102B17AB-E9E9-410B-A3B7-201F5C6EC2F3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3646162816.925126775fcd02</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://expandeddramaturgies.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3956050E-E3DB-4EE5-AC11-0C607332924A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Learning to Write Spaces</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Contemporary Theatre Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4b275411489d2e326e8859ee3bae6f17"><gtr:id>4b275411489d2e326e8859ee3bae6f17</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Turner C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54410225f409e7.78040384</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FB44219D-7CC0-4531-9A56-6A34CBC9809F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Something to Glance Off: Writing Space</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7350d33422c81671ec28f9780fe7a2b4"><gtr:id>7350d33422c81671ec28f9780fe7a2b4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cathy Turner (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>m_127078150613a36e08</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FD8CE2E4-1C0F-4EFB-8230-45435AA73C2E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Writing for the contemporary theatre: towards a radically inclusive dramaturgy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Studies in Theatre and Performance</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4b275411489d2e326e8859ee3bae6f17"><gtr:id>4b275411489d2e326e8859ee3bae6f17</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Turner C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54410347286b12.85948912</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B5D142C6-9633-42A4-AB77-BABA24059687</gtr:id><gtr:title>Getting the 'now' into the written text: developing dramaturgies of process.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7350d33422c81671ec28f9780fe7a2b4"><gtr:id>7350d33422c81671ec28f9780fe7a2b4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cathy Turner (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>m_454584010113a36ebc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F012489/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2DB2E75A-C815-466B-A26B-60EB301AD722</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dramaturgy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
