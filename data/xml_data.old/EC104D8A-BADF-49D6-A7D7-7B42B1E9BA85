As the embryo grows and develops, its cells begin to specialise. The cells set aside to make the foetus start off as a blank slate - each cell can make every cell type of the body. This property is called pluripotency. In the embryo, pluripotency is a transient property that disappears as cells sequentially specialise into specific tissues. This process of specialisation is called differentiation, and eventually generates all the cells of adult body. However, during early development it is essential to set aside some cells that have the capacity to form a new embryo. These cells are called germ cells and in mammals they are the precursors of sperm or eggs. While the sperm and egg appear very specialised, upon fertilisation they form a new embryo and then more pluripotent cells and the cycle begins afresh. Thus, the germline cycle forms the perpetual link between the generations. Herein lies the paradox of germ cells - although overtly specialised, they are the only differentiated cell type that can produce pluripotent cells in the next generation. We do not understand how these conflicting demands are controlled and regulated in germ cells. In fact, the cell potency, or the range of differentiation options available to a given cell, has not yet been empirically verified in germ cells. Therefore further work is needed if we are to understand the properties and potential of this critical cell lineage. This knowledge will influence our understanding of embryonic development and inform how we can direct stem cells to make useful cell types. 

The first goal of our research programme is to test the potency of early germ cells by injecting them back into early mouse embryos. This generates a hybrid or chimaera. Using modern techniques it is possible to monitor the injected cells and track their behaviour. Proper assessment of cell potency requires demonstrating contribution to functional tissues in an adult organism. We will therefore perform these experiments in the mouse, a species for which all the necessary tools exist to perform such an analyses. In vivo experiments are essential if we are to fully understand the fundamental properties of this unique cell type. 

While this fundamental scientific question is our primary motivation, we also aim to to answer questions relevant to human fertility and regenerative medicine. 

Recent advances have enabled early germ cells to be induced from stem cells. These in vitro derived cells are capable of making sperm and eggs, which in turn can make live mice. If applied to human cells, this research has the potential to revolutionise fertility treatments. If these cells are to be successful as a medical treatment it will be necessary to assess whether they are equivalent to normal germ cells, or whether they have a memory of their stem cell origin. We will use the assays described above to test their cell potency. The results will inform strategies to translate this technology to the clinic safely. 

Chimaeric animals are emerging as a transformative approach in biomedical research. Recent advances mean that the prospect of growing human organs in another species is now real. There are ethical considerations with such techniques, which require an ongoing dialogue between basic scientists, clinicians and society. Further work is required to understand how cells behave in chimaeras, in particular how easily cells may colonise the germline. One recently described method is to inject more differentiated cells to embryos to bias their contribution. Under normal conditions these cells would die but by inhibiting cell death it has been possible to overcome this barrier, allowing the generation of region specific chimaeras. We will test whether by inhibiting cell death in germ cells it is possible to colonise the germline directly, a question with direct relevance to the ongoing use of chimaeras in regenerative medicine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are traditionally considered unipotent, as during normal development they only give rise to the gametes. However, upon fertilization they form the totipotent zygote, a single cell with the potential to generate an entire organism. Furthermore, PGCs are the cell of origin of pluripotent teratocarcinomas and can form pluripotent stem cells in vitro with remarkable efficiency. These contradictory observations challenge the interpretation of PGC potency. A conclusive assessment of the potential of PGCs throughout their development is required to designate their potential. We will inject PGCs to pre-implantation mouse embryos to assess their developmental potential in chimaeras. We will compare early and late stage PGCs to assess the relationship between germline differentiation and potency. This knowledge will influence our understanding of embryonic development and inform how we can direct stem cells to make useful cell types. 

We will test whether in vitro culture or derivation impacts PGC potency. This information will inform strategies to translate in vitro gametogenesis technology safely, which may ultimately impact the treatment of human infertility. 

We will study whether inhibiting apoptosis influences the behaviour of PGCs in chimaeras and whether it might allow improved contribution or direct germline contribution. This may influence how chimaeras are used in regenerative medicine approaches. 

Finally we will study ectopic PGCs to ascertain whether the gonadal environment influences PGC development and potency. We will assess whether the gonadal niche is required to mature PGCs, trigger epigenetic reprogramming and restrict their potential. Ectopic PGCs are believed to be the cell of origin of extragonadal teratocarcinomas, which may develop due to lack of appropriate developmental cues to restrict their potency. Identification of such a signal may allow the development of more efficacious and better-targeted therapies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic Impact: The academic impact is fully stated in the 'Academic beneficiaries' section. This proposal has clear implications across a range of fields including stem cell and developmental biology, reproductive biology and epigenetics (including epigenetic reprogramming and transgenerational effects). 

Public engagement/education: The project is likely to have educational impact and allows for various ways of public engagement. The work has the potential to challenge the textbook description of how an embryo develops and how cells differentiate. As such, this may impact secondary and higher education in science and medicine. A direct impact on secondary education will be possible through engagement and outreach activities with young people in the local area. In secondary education, the PI is the module lead for a Stem Cell and Reproductive Biology Module at Imperial College and will challenge his students with the basic questions in this grant, in real problem-solving classroom scenarios. Advances in stem cell biology and reproductive science have the ability to capture the public's imagination. The basic conceptual questions asked by this project will allow a broad discussion with the public about the potency and potential application of cells - which is not only desirable to spread a broader understanding of science but essential to ensure there is sufficient public support so that the promise of stem cells and regenerative medicine are realised. Public outreach will be achieved through annual science festivals and by investigating how best to utilise social media to maximise public interaction. Public and educational outreach can be instigated from the very start of the project and has the potential for a lasting impact well beyond the lifetime of this grant. 

Industry/IP: While socio-economic impact is of course difficult to predict, the project is likely to generate patentable IP for a range of commercialisation purposes and industry applications in regenerative and reproductive medicine as well as agriculture. Experiments with in vitro PGCs may well impact in vitro gametogenesis (IVG) approaches with commercial relevance in reproductive biotechnology. If direct germline contribution of injected PGCs can be demonstrated this may have application in agriculture for generation of transgenic mammalian species in which ES cell technology is not available (all non-rodent species). 

Law/ethics/policy making: The use of interspecific chimaeras in regenerative medicine approaches is accompanied by legal and ethical dilemmas. For instance, there are concerns about the possibility of human gametes being formed in non-human species. By studying the behaviour of cells in chimaeric animals, including their potential germline contribution, we will be able to offer empirical insights on the topic to policy makers and will actively seek dialogue and respond to upcoming consultations. 

Medicine: The work has the potential to inform translational approaches, most notably in the fields of IVG and regenerative medicine, seeking to update underlying biology knowledge so that current strategies can be modified and improved for patients' benefit and safety. In particular, improving IVG technology may impact the treatment of human infertility. Furthering our knowledge of the biology of ectopic germ cells - including their epigenetic status and potency - may be informative regarding the underlying biology of teratocarcinomas and germline tumours. This may highlight alternative therapeutic targets. While current chemotherapy has a high success rate, more effective drugs could reduce chemotherapy toxicity and treat resistant tumours.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>472382</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R002703/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9898EFC8-73AB-4E1E-A207-04A486D9F1A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal developmental biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6EF57B2-8ACD-48E6-9B45-98507446B053</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigenetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CF8D454F-63BF-45A6-8974-473A3150758A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stem cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>195B48B4-2BC5-4DEB-BA1A-323A90D8730D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tissue engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
