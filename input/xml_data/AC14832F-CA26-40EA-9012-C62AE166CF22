It will be within the European Union, have continued links to the rest of the United Kingdom and face competitive pressures from world markets. We can learn a lot from other small nations, whether they be independent states or federal units.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project examines the experience of small states in northern Europe, Quebec, and stateless nations in Spain and Belgium. It examines institutions, modes of policy making and the cultural norms that sustain the. It constrasts states with high levels of spendng with those with low levels; states with pluralist models of policy making with those practising social concertation; and neo-liberal and social democratic models. It identifies the key factors underpinning each and compares these with conditions in Scotland.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the nature of the initiative, there is an unusually strong emphasis on non-academic users. The aim is to inform the debate on Scotland's constitutional future by clarifying options and exploring their implications. 
The first set of beneficiaries are the policy-makers who will prepare the options and define the details of what is meant by independence, or extended devolution. It is difficult to influence politicians and political parties directly, as their positions will be increasingly entrenched and they will look to defend them. The research, however, will provide ideas that can be used to challenge the parties and force them to define their proposals more rigorously. The research will also be communicated to MPs and MSPs and to parliamentary committees in the form of written and oral evidence. The second group of policy influentials are the civil servants. It is not for them to define policy goals but they do need to translate them into practical proposals and advise politicians on their implications. There will be succinct briefing papers and the researchers will be available for consultation on all aspects of the research and the findings. This builds on practice developed in recent years of developing links with policy practitioners, recognizing the conventions of civil service neutrality, discretion and anonymity. 
The second set of beneficiaries are people and groups in civil society. There is a number of organizations, think tanks and forums devoted to debating the constitutional issue in Scotland and exploring the options, some of them challenging the terms of debate set by the main parties. They are always looking for new material and evidence presented in a user-friendly manner. Given the nature of this project, there is also a strong interest on the part of business, trades unions and the voluntary sector in the implications of change for their role, status and influence. 
The third set of beneficiaries are the citizens, who will be asked to make a decision in the referendum of 2014 and in subsequent elections. There is a strong public interest in the independence question but a lack of understanding which is a result of the fact that citizens have got their information from the political parties, who have their own motives for presenting their case in particular ways, and from the media, who have not always done a good job in clarifying the issues. The way to reach the public is via the media by providing good analysis in a readily comprehensible form. Some sections of the media are highly partisan and sensationalist, but there are also responsible journalists looking for good analytical material and prepared to take the time to read and use it. It is also important to communicate the findings to the media and public outwith Scotland, in other parts of the United Kingdom as well as abroad.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>148451</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oslo</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Norway, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Small States in the Modern World.

This worked at several levels.
1. We worked with both the UK and Scottish Governments at civil service level in the two years before the Scottish referendum. The latter were particularly interested in what small states might do, but also what Scotland might do under enhanced devolution. Civil servants attended our conference in March 2013 and we organized an academic practitioner seminar in Edinburgh in May 2014. I also made two presentations in the offices of the Scottish Government and have discussed our findings with officials of the government of Catalonia. We are continuing to work with Scottish civil servants on taxation and welfare in the context of further devolution and the small state examples feature in this. 
2. I have addressed meetings organized by the voluntary sector and the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organizations. They are interested in the lessons from the Nordic countries about social policy and welfare. I also addressed a meeting organized by the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce.
3. We targeted the general public with a short, reader-friendly book, Small Nations in Big World. There were public launches of the book in Edinburgh and Aberdeen and a presentation during the Edinburgh Festival. The book sold 300 copies and a second edition is about to appear. It is being translated into Catalan and the president of the Catalan government personally requested a copy to read. The book has also attracted interest in Ireland. The small nations work was a theme in our public meetings around Scotland during the referendum. Details of these activities are given in the appropriate section.
4. We have worked with the media and between this project and the following large grant project on the referendum, I did over 200 interviews in English, French, Spanish and Italian, reaching a Scottish, a UK and an international audience.
5. On the academic side, I organized two meetings, in Oslo and Berlin, in collaboration with Harald Baldersheim of the University of Oslo. The result is an edited book on small states, in press with Edward Elgar publishers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A54F130B-B43C-4A8B-B73F-AF7CB8095674</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463566b44e637.56514148</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Small states can be viable in modern Europe. We identify two models of adaptation, the market-liberal and the social-investment models. There is an aspiration in Scotland to adopt a Nordic-typle social investment model. This is possible but it would require internal institutional change. After the No vote in the referendum this issue is still relevant as Scotland needs to develop its own tax-welfare balance and social model.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are currently working with Scottish Government officials on taxation and welfare options for Scotland.
