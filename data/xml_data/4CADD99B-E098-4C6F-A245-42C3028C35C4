The project aims to create a full analysis of Scottish knowledge networking in this period. The interwoven relations of people, ideas and methods created Scotland?s leading edge internationally in the mid-20th century. We shall analyse and explain the influence of Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson in this network of Scottish educational research, and in intelligence theory and applications. The catalytic effects of the Scottish Council for Research in Education, the interest of the Educational Institute of Scotland and its members, and the financial support of the Carnegie Foundations in New York, all helped to organise the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey. The intensive and voluntary nature of the considerable Scottish activity in mental testing and educational research is unusual and has never been explained properly. The focus of this study will be on: the specific locations and cultural contexts of scientific research; the exchange in international networks of ideas, methods and results; the intellectual history of key individuals; and the relation between statistics and text, and between scientific advance and the governing of education systems.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296425</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Social Policy</gtr:department><gtr:description>David Bartholomew</gtr:description><gtr:id>D1C6C0B4-ACCE-4703-86D6-C65C8D934701</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two published papers have appeared from this collaboration, and one more is submitted.

Entrance to the exhibition is free, and it is open to the public.

Piles of intriguing ledgers and personal mementos will feature in an exhibition reconstructing the life and work of Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson. Sir Godfrey - who led the world's only nationwide IQ tests, in Scotland - was an innovative educator who firmly belived that educational opportunity should not be linked to social staus. From the 1920s onwards he advocated comprehensive education. Thomson was based at the Moray House School of Education, now part of the University of Edinburgh. His greatest legacy for today's researchers was to test the intelligence of almost every Scottish 11-year-old child in 1932, and again in 1947. 

For the first time, the Scottish Mental Survey's unique ledgers will go on public view, with a selection of sample pages on show. The ledgers hold the world's only record of IQ-type scores from full national year-of-birth cohorts.

Sir Godfrey's findings have formed the basis of much of the cutting-edge research at the University of Edinburgh since the late 1990's into how the brain ages, led by Professor Ian Deary. His team studies the now-older people who took part in the Scottish Mental Surveys.

Ian has spent the past decade investigating Sir Godfrey's life, and in 2008 he rescued a mass of never-before-seen documents and objects from Thomson's family home in Edinburgh, just before it was demolished. A selection of those artefacts, portraits and documents feature in the exhibition, telling the story of who Sir Godfrey was and what his motivations were.

Ian Deary said: &amp;quot;Godfrey Thomson saw mental ability tests as an imperfect but useful means to give poor children a chance in life. He was determined to look past pupils' social status, and try to see their underlying ability. By all accounts he was modest, not motivated by money, and happy to share academic wins, which in part led him to fade from the history books. I'm delighted we are now able better to understand and evaluate the pioneering work of this multi-talented and elusive man.&amp;quot;

We explained the most important element in the development and maintenance of the 'Scottish School': the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE), a specific national cultural and political response to the modernisation of Scottish schooling. SCRE was a network representing key institutions (EIS, Directors of Education, Universities, training colleges) and significant actors which in turn mobilised wider networks. A pioneering research culture, in the UK and Europe, was formed with its own forms of inquiry, tools, institutions and models of engagement. The study explored the cultural, intellectual and social context of educational research in Scotland and its relations globally, in particular Scotland's involvement in the IEI, Boyd and the teacher testing movement, and the intellectual arguments used to explain society and the use of testing.



The project revealed the full range of the work of Scottish actors, particularly Thomson, in advancing theories of intelligence and assessment technologies, which underpinned the innovatory Scottish Mental Surveys of 1932 and 1947, and were recognized in the core American and British debates on intelligence. For example, we have revealed the importance of Thomson's 'bonds' model of intelligence, a theory we have shown was equal to that of Spearman's 'two factor' model, and explored the debates and discussions between Thomson, Spearman and Thorndike. Thomson pioneered the use of factor analysis and maximum likelihood estimation: innovative work on a new mathematical model is taking Thomson's ideas into contemporary brain studies.



A major component and outcome of the project has been the collection, catalogue, conservation and deposit of core documents and texts in Edinburgh University Special Collections. This material, with its analysis, is the basis for the claim for a significant 'Scottish School'. This new archive has created a novel, coherent collection from earlier holdings, combined with a major university retrieval process of undiscovered material relating especially to the scientific, testing lab and university research leadership of Thomson (and colleagues) at the combined research and training department (Moray House). This archive is now linked to other sites, connecting elements of the 'School' together, and will enable future researchers to research the significant work of the 'School', for example, in research organisation or on the history of testing. Until now, this rich period of Scottish theoretical, methodological and policy innovation, in psychology and educational research, has not existed as a place or subject of study. 



The project has revealed the possibilities of studying disciplinary, scientific and the national/international in educational research and psychology through period, place and space by the re-analysis of contemporary documents; the relational study of separated events, institutions and actors; the flow of scientific data and processes, and the significance of cross border exchanges; and through the close examination of tools, concepts, training and projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The collection of original archival materials has been lodged with Special Collections at Edinburgh University and is now available for others to view and use. 
The collection of pre-existing archival materials remains with the study and is available as a resource for other researchers. 
Findings from the study have helped with planning further grant applications, and understanding more of the background to the follow-up studies of the Scottish Mental Surveys.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8601C5D0-44E4-4993-986A-15178E846705</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3482209782.5652087762398e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ces.ed.ac.uk/SSER/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The Centre's statistician, Dr Mike Allerhand, developed an R package in order to implement the Bonds theory of intelligence first proposed by Godfrey Thomson.
