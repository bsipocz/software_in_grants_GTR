The Network will develop programmes for policy and business managers, focused on &amp;quot;data-driven&amp;quot; approaches, as well as high-end quantitative training in urban informatics for urban researchers, analysts and planners. The network would be open to researchers and practitioners who could both contribute towards and benefit from involvement. It will be both multidisciplinary and international, open to academics from a wide range of disciplines including urban studies, social policy, business and organisation studies, engineering, computer science etc. who see the network as an opportunity to draw together expertise on data analytics focused on business and cities and share it, through a set of managed activities. It will include the junior and early career researchers, as well as PhD students. Where appropriate we would liaise with the Doctoral Training Centres to develop engagement and participation in our network.

The recruitment for our set of activities will be based on the following approach:
Academic training: we will target disciplines which can benefit from exposure to Social Analytics and that suffer from lack of skills in this area. These include social policy, business studies, urban studies etc. but we will consult with the DTC to identify these areas more precisely.
Business and policy training: we will target sectors that have access to data but lack the capacity in Social Analytics to fully benefit from it. We will consult with organisations like city and central governments and ICAEW, CBI and Insitute of Directors to identify the specific companies that can benefit from training.
Visiting scholars: our objective is to improve foster collaboration between the UK academic community and academic centres which are the forefront of research in Social Analytics. We will then reach out to academics from other UK institutions and overseas partners to develop new research and knowledge exchange relationships. 

Three strands of activity are envisaged:

a) a set of user-focused seminars offered by a mix of academic and non-academic experts, the main objectives of which are to improve organisations' understanding of techniques for the analysis of a variety of historical and real-time data, to share the best practice around analytics and to develop collaborative links between major users and university researchers. 

b) the development of a training programme arranged into three different tracks, tailored to the requirement of different sectors, but allowing significant crossover. The tracks will fully utilise the business analytics and urban analytics research agenda of BLGDRC and UBDC

c) a programme of visiting fellowships which could be held either by external academic, including overseas, experts or by senior/middle managers of user organisations. Fellows will be tasked with the development or implementation of analytical techniques involving the use of real-time data in combination with other types of data, using the resources of the Centres</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This section describes the approach the network will adopt to maximise the impact generated by its activities among beneficiaries, users and stakeholders over the lifetime of the award. In particular, the strategy will enable the network to accelerate the impact of its main streams of activities via a range of mechanisms centred on the exchange of ideas, individuals and knowledge with user and stakeholder communities.

The objectives of the Impact strategy are the following:

1) to increase our key stakeholders' awareness of the Centre's activities as well as build their support into its fabric.

2) to ensure that the results of our research are instrumental in driving positive changes in the behaviour of the beneficiaries of the Centre's activities.

3) to ensure that impacts from the Centre's activities are captured and communicated to external partners, stakeholders and the general public.

The impact strategy the Centre will deliver is composed of the following four areas of activity:

1) Communicate and engage with a diverse group of users, stakeholders and general public.

2) Grow the network of influence and relationships through our Knowledge Exchange activities.

3) Build on the network of data providers and users to generate impact. 

4) Develop a new and dynamic model of two-way dialogue with users and stakeholders.

Non-academic beneficiaries of the Centre include a range of organisations and individuals, operating at several levels. 

Key beneficiaries include:

1) Businesses will benefit by having access to training activities, which will build their capacity in big data analytics to support their decision-making.

2) Local government researchers and policy makers will benefit as both data owners and data producers. The network will demonstrate how they can use social analytics in a novel way and extract new information to support their policy-making processes and service delivery.

3) Government department researchers and policy makers. The methodological developments and training activities will provide a model of relevance for all areas of the UK. The likely impact is significant as new ways of utilising big data are developed.

4) Practitioners such as urban planners and city managers will have access to training activities and the visiting scholar programme, as well as specialist expertise and novel methods in data analytics.

5) Citizen scientists with a keen interest in data and social analytics will be able to enhance their knowledge and capacity through public seminars and training activities.

6) General public. The general public will benefit through more informed policy-making and an awareness of the benefits Social Analytics provides including public engagement around the re-use of data for social research. We expect findings to be reported in news media and to stimulate public debate.

Direct impacts on beneficiaries in knowledge exchange and capacity-building will be evident in the development of the strategic network and delivery of the training and outreach activities. Impacts on policy debates will be evident through the use of the network's expertise, publications and white papers. The indirect impacts on society as a whole (via the effect of research influence on policy and practice) are more difficult to specify but we anticipate the BOK we create will be widely used.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99456</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Iowa State University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>SASNet Fellowship Programme: Dr Anuj Sharma, Iowa State University</gtr:description><gtr:id>D59ECAB6-0306-4109-9544-B8C430B49DB2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcome from this collaboration to date has been in the form of improved capacity within the field of data analytics covered in the training.
