Why do some people choose Coke, and others water, to accompany their dinner or to quench their thirst? We know very little about the psychological processes underlying these behaviours. While the motivation for unhealthy food has been researched extensively, the motivation for sugary drinks remains understudied, despite their negative health implications. Up to 19% of daily calorie intake consists of sugar from drinks, and the consumption of sugary drinks contributes to weight gain. The consumption of sugary drinks is a main contributor to poor dental health and to overweight, which cost the NHS &amp;pound; 3.4 billon and &amp;pound; 4.7 billion a year in England alone (Public Health England, 2014). Especially given the recent media attention, many consumers are aware of the health implications of sugary drinks, but struggle to successfully reduce their intake. Therefore, it is important to understand what underlies the motivation for sugary drinks, and how we can effectively assist consumers in replacing sugary drinks with healthier alternatives such as water.

We propose that sugary drinks gain their attractiveness through consumption and reward simulations. In other words, when people see or think about a sugary drink, they spontaneously simulate (i.e., re-experience) the sensation and the reward of consuming it, such as its taste, the resulting energy boost, and the quenching of thirst, based on their previous, rewarding experiences. These simulations trigger a desire to consume sugary drinks, particularly when feeling thirsty. Although evidence exists for the role of such simulations in the motivation for food, no previous studies have applied this account to drinks. Our research will first systematically test this simulation account of the motivation for sugary drinks, and then use it to stimulate healthier choices in innovative ways. 

In Subproject 1, we will investigate the specific simulations that are triggered bsugary drinks and by water. Building on recent pilot data that we have collected, we expect that sugary drinks will trigger more consumption and reward simulations (&amp;quot;cold&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fizzy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tasty&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;refreshing&amp;quot;) than water, particularly among high consumers of sugary drinks, and particularly when thirsty. In Subproject 2, we will link these consumption and reward simulations to the motivation to consume sugary drinks and water. To this end, we will use a novel method to assess motivation unobtrusively: we will measure the degree to which participants slightly lean forward on a Wii balance board when viewing images of drinks. Such subtle approach movements have been shown to reflect motivation and desire. We predict that more consumption and reward simulations will be associated with leaning forward more toward sugary drinks images, especially among high consumers of sugary drinks and especially when thirsty. 

Finally, in Subproject 3, we will use these findings to develop an intervention approach to help consumers replace sugary drinks with water. Typically, advertisements for sugary drinks focus heavily on consumption and reward, whereas advertisements for water focus on purity and health benefits. We propose that motivation for consuming water can be increased by boosting consumption and reward simulations, in a similar way as for sugary drinks. Thus, we will test whether using images and words that trigger consumption and reward simulations for drinking water makes water more attractive and increases water choices, and reduces choices for sugary drinks. We will test this in both online and field experiments with actual consumers in naturalistic settings. 

Together, these experiments will help us understand what makes sugary drinks so difficult to resist, and how health practitioners, intervention developers, and industry can boost the motivational appeal of healthier alternatives to stimulate healthier beverage choices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposed research has great potential for impact on industry partners and the public. 

Industry partners
To increase the impact of our work in applications in the food and drink industry, we have established connections with a key industry partner, Danone, with a keen interest in healthy beverages. Danone is one of the world's leading bottled water companies and has three major water brands, Evian, Volvic, and Badoit. In developing this project, Dr Papies has consulted extensively with senior research scientists at Danone Research Centres in the Netherlands and France, who have advised on the current proposal and support it fully (see attached letter of support). 
While researchers at Danone have a lot of expertise on the health benefits of water and on the expectations that water consumers have from drinking water, it is clear that they will benefit from insights into the exact psychological mechanisms underlying the motivation for sugary drinks or water. Our pilot findings, which pointed to strong qualitative differences in the simulations that are triggered by sugary drinks and by water, were of great interest. It is clear that our research may have significant implications for the ways to best market bottled water to make it attractive to consumers and facilitate the development of healthier habits - a key goal of Danone. Therefore, we will have monthly consultations with the Water Group at Danone Sensory and Behavior Science. We will update these partners on the progress of the research, integrate their suggestions into our designs, and prepare a mid-term and a final report to disseminate our findings within Danone most effectively. 
In addition, our findings may also be of interest to Unilever, who our laboratory collaborates with on different research projects in both the UK and The Netherlands. Unilever also has several brands of non-alcoholic beverages and have a keen interest in sugar reduction, so that they will benefit from insights into what leads to the motivation to consume sugar-sweetened drinks. If our project receives funding, we will update our partners at Unilever on the planned work and consult with them on potential industry applications of our work. 

Media and public engagement
Like our previous work, we plan to publicise our research to a broad audience through news media, public lectures, and science museums. Our previous work has been covered by a wide variety of international and national (Dutch) media, including Time Magazine, the Huffington Post, the BBC, Reuters News, De Standaard, NRC Handelsblad, and a documentary on German public TV (WDR). To facilitate media interest, we will issue press releases through the University of Glasgow Press Office after the publication of results of each of the three subprojects. In addition, the high-impact journals academic journals to which we will be submitting our work also issue their own press releases, which will further increase the media exposure of our findings. 
Dr Papies has given lectures on public science days, and has collaborated with the science museum in Utrecht, The Netherlands, for a permanent exhibit on her work, and with the Glasgow Science Centre for a month-long knowledge exchange activity on the psychology of health behaviour. We will disseminate the findings of the research proposed here by giving presentations at events such as the ESRC Festival of Social Science and the European Researchers Night. In addition, we will collaborate with the Glasgow Science Centre for a knowledge exchange activity, which will allow us to engage directly with potentially hundreds of community members. Here, we will prepare an interactive exhibit where visitors can experience their own simulations in response to sugary drinks and water, get feedback on these simulations, learn about possible implications for their consumption behaviour, and receive tips on healthy beverage choices for themselves and their families.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>332119</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R005419/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
