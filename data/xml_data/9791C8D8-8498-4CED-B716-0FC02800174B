However, in recent years, it has become clear that mechanical ventilation can exacerbate lung damage and may even be the primary factor in lung injury e.g. ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Consequently, lung protective ventilation (LPV) strategies have been developed, including positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). Despite the use of LPV, the mortality associated with ARDS and ALI is still great, with reported rates between 33 and 55%.

Thoracic electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has emerged as a promising new imaging tool for bedside use. It is a non-invasive technique which provides the internal conductivity distribution based on electrical measurements on the skin. Existing research and commercial EIT systems have typically arranged measurement electrodes in rings around the thorax and produced two-dimensional image slices based on over-simplified two-dimensional generic shapes e.g. circular or elliptical cross-sections. Unfortunately, such an approach creates significant image artefacts and poor levels of repeatability. In order to eliminate this problem, EIT measurements and image reconstruction must be treated as a fully three-dimensional problem, taking into account the electrode positions and the body shape of the patient. One of the aims of this project is to provide reliable and robust three-dimensional EIT image reconstruction based on 3D informed body shape acquired from other modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and x-ray computed tomography.

Currently, there exists no consensus amongst clinicians on how to optimize PEEP ventilator settings. Improved knowledge about the distribution of ventilation will enable clinicians to set more appropriate ventilation parameters in order to reduce the potential occurrence of VILI. In particular, the value of bedside EIT monitoring for determining the effect of PEEP in comparison with traditional indirect methods, such as arterial oxygenation or global tidal volumes, is still largely unknown. Additionally, despite the clear link between lung mechanics and regional ventilation, ventilator settings are normally based on blood gases and pressure-volume curves rather than measurements of lung mechanics. A significant aim of this project is to provide clinicians with robust image-based lung mechanics models which will further aid the validation of EIT in the ICU.
Previous clinical EIT studies have generally utilized EIT instruments operating at relatively slow frame rates, inflexible drive and measurement strategies along with limited number of electrodes. In this project, we will develop a state-of-the-art fast 3D EIT system using advanced measurement techniques which have not yet had a significant impact in the clinical environment. In fact, there has never been a substantial investigation of EIT in the ICU which has drawn together the unique combination of high quality EIT measurements, three-dimensional image reconstruction and the validation of lung mechanics modelling.

We propose to establish a world-leading capability in the measurement and imaging by EIT in the ICU. This project builds upon the substantial expertise in EIT at the University of Manchester (UoM) and the UK's leading clinical group in applied thoracic EIT at Kings College London and Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust. We will also build upon the world-leading capability at UoM in modelling and dynamic MRI acquisition including oxygen-enhanced and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. The proposed project registers strongly on the EPSRC research theme of healthcare technologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>629186</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of G?ttingen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with University of Gottingen</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA0D8CFD-00B1-42A1-A612-ECCD78B93FDA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Still too early for concrete outcomes, but collaborative grant planning underway</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58cbeeef59d559.27372541-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Developing relationship in the field of advanced monitoring of respiratory function in critically ill patients with severe respiratory failure, with our group represented by Dr Luigi Camporota, and our partners by Prof Miachael Quintel and Prof Luciano Gattinoni</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Developing relationship on advanced respiratory monitoring with the University of Gottingen</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The preparatory clinical data collection component has facilitated more structured imaging and physiological assessment of critically ill patients with severe respiratory failure</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BCC8C2DE-C35A-4FAC-AE75-A6B7DDCC039B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56fd8762808a56.02191325</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Preparatory mathematical modelling for the implementation of a lung impedance monitor for use in patients has been undertaken, as well as some preliminary clinical imaging work</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In due course, if our goals are achieved, we hope to have a better approach to monitoring and visualising real-time lung function in critically ill patients.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AEE291EE-69E8-4EBE-9B7D-6220582BCEB6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56fd86b885a841.95884903</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Electronics,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The overall project is structured in four different phases comprising an initial engineering and mathematical phase (during which EIT electrodes are designed and built, and a software algorithm is developed) of a later phase, with clinical involvement: a clinical bench to bedside testing of the device and software algorithm developed.

The project is still in the initial engineering phase. However, KCL is contributing to this initial phase by acquiring electrical impedance tomography images - using a commercially available system and analysis tool- and pairing them to anonymised chest CT images, obtained in a protocolised fashion in tightly defined severe ARDS patient population. This allows better definition of the geometrical parameters necessary to build the new software and better define pattern of electrode placement.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>A7DD53FD-3832-4B60-93FF-25CD610C645B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enabling ongoing project work</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56fc381fdb1394.55125657</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>R3M</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved Technique/Technology</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L019396/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
