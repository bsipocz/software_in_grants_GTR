Jerusalem is perhaps the world's most iconic city: the place that exists most resonantly as both a physical space and a series of often-contested memories and ideas with a pan-Mediterranean and pan-European heritage. This project will adopt a long historical view to explore the variety of ways the city has been imaginatively rebuilt, reconquered, and relocated across Europe and beyond, from the Siege of Jerusalem during the First Crusade (1099) to the present day. We will draw together a network of experts from Britain, Europe, and the United States to build the first reception history of a city, and to argue for Jerusalem as an idea which has been appropriated and reworked across a rich terrain of material remakings, policy, public discourse, literature and the arts. Our invesigations will take us from pornographic conceits to Utopian visions, investigating how and why Jerusalem became an archetype for division, lamentation, and loss, as well as for celestial glory and novel projects in urban planning.

The case study of 'Imagining Jerusalem' offers an ideal opportunity to confront directly some of the difficult issues facing research in the Arts and Humanities today: what is the meaning, and what are the politics, of heritage as a cultural movement? How are cultural and collective memories forged, and how do they contribute to, but also delimit, ideas about the future and its possible shapes? What acts of imagination are necessary to interpret the lessons of the past within the present moment? How have popular and collective forms of memory and culture been used within, or helped to shape, political, legal, and conceptual discourses at crucial historical moments? The proposed network will create a hub for researchers to address these questions through a specific, and highly resonant, theme.

Network members will meet three times at workshops in York, London, and Parma; each workshop will be informed by an accessible, public strand, which will draw on key local examples, from the Fausto Levi Synagogue and Museum in Soragna (formerly a synagogue for the Jewish diaspora excluded from Parma, then a Fascist social club before its most recent reincarnation as a space of heritage and memorialisation), to the Jerusalem Chamber in Westminster Abbey, site of a series of key political and dramatic moments for England and its neighbours. We will sponsor a series of double-header public lectures which will be designed explicitly to bring past histories and present concerns into conversation, and we will invite members of the public to join us for a 'foodways' event, exploring how gastronomy (from the pilgrim dinner of bread and cheese to the explicitly conciliatory cooking of Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi) has brought the flavours and customs of Jerusalem into communities across Europe. Our findings and conversations will be published as part of a blog, with a global reach, which will feature podcasts, short films, and interviews with network members, as well as a series of compelling historical case studies and examples. We will work together to create a cross-period special issue of a major, international journal, showcasing both the vexed and vibrant history of Jerusalem as idea and imagined space, and the rewards of pan-historical, comparative, interdisciplinary research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our impact activities will be linked directly to the series of planned workshops. On each occasion, we will conclude the workshop with a double-header public lecture which will be designed to bring into conversation two very different approaches to the idea of Jerusalem, in distinct historical contexts. These lectures will be filmed, and made available (with explanatory commentary) on the project blog. This blog forms a key strand of our impact activity: we are confident that it will reach a global audience (on the model of the blog for the AHRC-funded project 'Conversion Narratives in Early Modern Europe'). Network members will be asked to commit to contributing material to the blog so that it is regularly updated, and forms a growing and dynamic reception history, featuring a wide range of case studies and examples. Alongside material from the public lectures, we will create short films around our visits to key heritage sites, made available on the blog and on youtube, and conduct interviews with network members and partners.

We will also run a 'foodways' event, designed to run as part of the York Festival of Ideas 2013, at which members of the public will be invited to consider the different gastronomic and gustatory experiences of Jerusalem, and to reflect more broadly on the cultural, social, and political significance of particular foodstuffs, preparation and manufacture, and dining rituals.

We have already made preliminary contact with a number of key Knowledge Exchange partners: the Fausto Levi Synagogue and Museum, the British Library, the Palestine Exploration Fund, and Westminster Abbey, and will run events in collaboration with each of these partners (visits to view maps at the British Library, to discuss the rich history of the Soragna Synagogue, and to chart the iconography and impact of the Jerusalem Chamber in British political, historical, and imaginative life; co-hosted lectures with Palestine Exploration Fund). As part of the network, we aim to consolidate these links and identify new partners and beneficiaries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35847</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Remembering Jerusalem conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4461C4E-8708-45E5-8921-7C80231E45F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our 2014 'Remembering Jerusalem' conference featured two public lectures, from Nabil Matar and Eyal Weizman.

In a series of short talks, speakers explored the contested heritage of Jerusalem, its place on the global stage, and its real and virtual futures. Topics included the campaign to preserve the City's cultural heritage, how Pok&amp;eacute;mon Go is remapping Jerusalem, and the city as viewed through the eyes of Palestinian poet laureates. The afternoon concluded with a panel discussion which asks how we might use the knowledge shared by our research community to imagine new futures, both for Jerusalem itself and for the idea of Jerusalem in public life.

The curators from the Metropolitan Museum spoke about the impact of our previous conference (2015) on their forthcoming exhibition (Jerusalem 1000-1400: Every People Under Heaven) which was in the final stages of preparation at the time of this event. This included consultation with several expert members of the network, including a catalogue essay from Professor Nabil Matar, based on the keynote lecture he delivered for us in 2015. In turn, this conversation and presentation influenced the thinking of the nascent 'Jerusalem' exhibition forthcoming at the Jewish Museum, Berlin, scheduled to open in late 2017. This exhibition will now take account not only of the choices and scholarship of the Met curators, but of the materials presented by academics and activists at the event.

We welcomed a local audience, which included academics, postgraduate and undergraduate students, and members of the public, to the event in King's Manor, with 53 people in attendance. The event has also been opened up to an international public by the inclusion of videos of the talks on the project blog.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5272b4c3758.90196480</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://jerusalems.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>45736</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Leverhulme Research Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Leverhulme Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>81812369-7DE3-4194-91AC-8D59DF0D5F26</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c3f2f5ed3138.19705533</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Most importantly, the activities of this network, and the resulting findings have informed two major exhibitions, reaching out to international audiences. Barbara Boehm and Melanie Holcomb, the curators of '&amp;quot;Every People Under Heaven&amp;quot;: Jerusalem 1000-1400' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (September 26, 2016-January 8, 2017; http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/jerusalem) attended our network conference at King's College London, in 2014, and discussed their provisional plans and vision for the exhibition with network members. They also benefitted from the research presented at the conference, and were inspired by a number of papers they heard, in terms both of the exhibition's intellectual content, and in terms of its innovative physical presentation, which drew on more modern papers considering artistic responses to Jerusalem. The curators commissioned a catalogue chapter from one of our keynote speakers, Nabil Matar, based on the plenary he gave in London.

The exhibition was well and widely reviewed (e.g. https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/25/jerusalem-every-people-under-heaven-exhibit-met-art-history; https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/arts/design/jerusalem-as-a-place-of-desire-and-death-at-the-metropolitan-museum.html; http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/03/the-passions-of-medieval-jerusalem. It attracted more than 220,000 visitors from across the world.

In early September 2016, as preparation of the exhibition was in its very final stages, the two Met curators met again with members of the network, at our public workshop and exhibition preview in York. Here they discussed the influence of the network on their own findings and presentation of materials, but also engaged in a wide-ranging public conversation with Gregor Lersch, curator and project manager of a forthcoming exhibition on Jerusalem at the Jewish Museum, Berlin. Lersch used this occasion as an opportunity to discuss the specific challenges of staging such an exhibition at the Jewish Museum, given both the potentially politically-sensitive nature of some material, and the smaller scale of the museum's resources. The event extended Lersch's networks among the academic community, and prompted some lively discussion around questions of interpretation and guiding which will influence the final exhibition, due to launch in September 2016.

Other participants in this event including hacktivists, heritage groups and academics, all of whom found that the conversation and cross-period dialogue challenged their perspectives in rewarding ways.

Beyond this impact on two major museums which attract global audiences, the network has had a wide impact on both academic and non-academic beneficiaries. The network has expanded to 35 core members, with a number of other academics enjoying the opportunities offered by a less formal affiliation and by participation in conferences and events. The November 2014 conference, in particular, sparked lively discussion on the role of political commitments in academic study, revealing telling divides between those working on contemporary Israel/Palestine and those working on older periods of Jerusalem's global history. The network's blog and twitter account have attracted over 33,000 page views from across the world, testifying to the project's broad reach and appeal.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6FE94302-7633-4E75-A984-2A46536B42F3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e15ea8bbcd20.64789984</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The primary aim of this network was to understand the variety of ways in which Jerusalem has been appropriated, reimagined and rebuilt across the world, from the siege of Jerusalem in 1099 until the present day. We knew at the beginning that Jerusalem had been both physically and imaginatively recreated by many different people at many different times; this project has added to our sense of the multitude of ways in which Jerusalem has been rebuilt and relocated. Core case studies range from imaginative pilgrimages (medieval and modern) to theme parks (from eighteenth century panoramas to the modern 'Holy Land Experience'), buildings across styles and centuries (some of which imitate key sites directly, some of which invoke them in more subtle ways), but also materials and souvenirs: handfuls of earth, pieces of stone, tins of air.

Our cross-period trajectory revealed compelling practices that spoke across the centuries: visitors to Jerusalem have, for example, had their bodies marked with tattoos in commemoration of their visit from at least the fourteenth century until the present day. We have considered how Jerusalem is navigated, both in reality and in the imagination - and how these categories might overlap, as tourists from the middle ages onwards have walked in the footsteps of religious figures, of literary texts and authors, and (much more recently) in search of Pok&amp;eacute;mon. These findings, as they relate to Jerusalem, are much more widely applicable, asking us to think about the virtual-material city as a knotted transhistorical phenomenon, and to think about how ideas, memories and fictions might shape many different cities and experiences drawn together under the broad heading of the new Jerusalem. Our findings also relate to the tension between Jerusalem as ideal city or visionary future, and the history of conflict and competing claims that shape the city's heritage, and have been carried over into millenial, industrial and other Jerusalem projects.

One of the, perhaps more controversial, findings of our projects relates to scholarly attitudes to Jerusalem and contemporary conflict. Put bluntly, scholars of modern Jerusalem often pay little attention to the longer history of the city, and to alternative imaginings of pluralism, toleration and co-existence, which can be traced back to 1099 and before, or to the city's lengthy history of conquest and violence. Equally, however, scholars of the historical Jerusalem and its pre-twentieth century re-creations do little to link their work either to the contemporary politics of Jerusalem itself or, often, to competing claims and local politics surrounding historical projects of simulation, modelling and relocation. These tensions emerged in relation to our large-scale international conference, and prompted a vigorous debate as to the place of politics in scientific investigation (broadly conceived). This debate influenced the curators of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Exhibition, 'Every People Under Heaven', as they prepared their own programme and materials, and will inform our forthcoming special issue on the reception history of Jerusalem, which we plan to act as a provocation to scholars to think across periods and geographies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our objective was to write something quite new: a reception history of a city as it has been remade and rethought across the world. This will not only be of use to scholars of the specific case studies our network members have developed and are developing, as well as to those working on the history, present and future of Jerusalem itself, and Israel-Palestine, but will offer a new way of thinking about histories of reception, cultural geography, space and the imagination, and the material forms taken by abstract concepts and ideas.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>376D8F26-1ECE-43E8-89AE-52AEE4E7DCA5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e15f5a04dd76.30478533</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Government,
