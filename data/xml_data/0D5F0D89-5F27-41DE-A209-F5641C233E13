of cumulative advantage/disadvantage</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K003348/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Our project focuses on a previously neglected area of research: how does providing care for grandchildren impact on the health and wellbeing of grandparents? Promoting the health and wellbeing of older people is a critical policy issue as the population ages, while social, economic and demographic changes across Europe point to an increasing role for grandparents in providing childcare support to families. Despite competing pressures on older workers to remain in the workforce for longer and to provide care to frail family members, there are additional pressures on grandparents to provide childcare. This is thought to be due to policies encouraging more mothers into the paid workforce, increases in rates of family breakdown and single motherhood, and financial pressures on families.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This vital economic and social role is largely overlooked or taken for granted by policymakers, and the health impacts on older people of taking on these childcare roles are not known.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our project is in the Ageing Cluster led by Professor Peter Llyod-Sherlock of Phase I of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>SDA initiative&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As the first study of its kind in the U.K. the research will be of international importance and will benefit a wide range of people. In addition to the academic community our project findings will be of interest to a wide variety of NGOs, including think tanks, older people's and intergenerational organisations and family charities engaged in policy work. For example, the research findings will be of direct interest to groups lobbying government on behalf of grandparents (Grandparents Plus) and intergenerational practice (Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Beth Johnson Foundation). Moreover, our research is likely to be of use to groups lobbying government for improvements to older people's lives such as Age UK, and those interested in equality issues such as the Commission for Equality and Human Rights and the Fawcett Society.

Our findings will also be of interest to those working on older people's issues in local authorities, government departments and independent policy bodies. For example, the Department of Health is likely to benefit from a much improved empirical knowledge base of the life course in considering social policy interventions in later life health outcomes. The Department of Work and Pensions is likely to benefit considering their interest in ageing well and in the extension of working lives.

The Institute of Gerontology has a longstanding connection with our project partners who have agreed to help with dissemination of the project results to key policy makers and to older people themselves. In addition to their role in aiding dissemination of project findings our project partners have agreed to be advisory group members guiding conceptual development and the policy implications arising from our work. Dissemination will take place formally and informally through these wide networks of policy actors. Formal dissemination activities will consist of a seminar to launch the project, a project web page to be hosted by Grandparents Plus, a professionally designed report of the research findings and an end of project seminar to distribute and publicise the findings to a wide audience of those involved in NGOs, EU and UK policy makers, other voluntary organizations and think tanks.

Most importantly this research will provide knowledge for older people and their families about the advantages and possible problems of providing grandparental care. It will enable them to make choices either directly or indirectly, by giving this kind of information to professionals who may advise them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156843</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Grandparents Plus</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Grandparents Plus</gtr:description><gtr:id>1C796C1C-F9BC-4693-B59C-3984B8D71CCE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have issued a report and press release through Grandparents Plus that is associated with this project.

This led to the formulation by my team of a series of new questions on grandparents drawing on our research. I then met with Clare Littleford and Margaret Blake, of the NatCen Social Research which carries out the fieldwork for the ELSA study, to discuss the inclusion of our questions on the 10th of May 2015. Following subsequent discussions and revisions to the questions (also with Professor James Nazroo, Univeristy of Manchester) the new grandparent questions arising from our work will be included in Wave 8 of the ELSA study.

A new series of questions on grandparents that we created and designed, drawing on our research, will are to be included in a future wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). The inclusion of these novel questions will provide us with new insights into the role of grandparents in family life - a critical issue given increasing pressures on older people to both work and care. Currently no detailed information is collected on grandparents in England that would enable us to assess the extent of grandparental involvement in family life and to make international comparisons with other international longitudinal studies such as the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5617a106b0f420.70991197</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>5.

More details are presented below.

Our findings have filled a vital gap in knowledge about the impact of providing care. For the first time, we demonstrated a clear benefit for grandparents of providing childcare. Previously there had been much debate about whether providing childcare might be harmful, or have no effect. Our launch event was held in October 2014 in Westminster. The event was well attended by representatives from academic, third sector and policy spheres including those from Age UK, Family and Childcare Trust, Relate, National Childcare Trust, the Trade Union Congress, Age International and the Department of Work and Pensions. Findings were also shared with organisations in the family sector including Working Families, Fawcett Society and Gingerbread. A blog was also written for the social media site Gransnet: http://www.gransnet.com/blogs/grandparents-and-childcare-crisis.

Our partner, Grandparents Plus, used the findings to influence the election manifestos of the three main political parties in the course of the general election in 2014. Grandparents Plus held round table discussions with MPs from these three parties, and drew on evidence from the project in these discussions. This work culminated in the deputy Labour leader announcing in their women's manifesto that the party proposed consulting on making it possible for parental leave to be transferable to a grandparent. http://www.labour.org.uk/blog/entry/labours-manifesto-for-women. This was reported in the media http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32322677.

The clinical director for mental health 31 May 2015 picked up on our finding in a Tweet, a sign that findings from our research are getting through to policy makers: &amp;quot;Geraldine Strathdee ?@DrG_NHS Gr8 grandparenting is good for the happiness &amp;amp; #mentalhealth of grandmas, grandpas &amp;amp; grandkids?&amp;quot;

Our research findings have continued to inform communications with government departments, ministers and political parties following the election of the new government, and continue to shape the future policy work of GrandparentsPlus - our partner organisation.

In addition, we were approached by those in charge of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a nationally representative study of people aged 50 and over, for our expertise on questions about grandparenting to be included in the study's future waves. This led to the formulation by my team of a new series of questions on grandparents. These new questions will now be included in Wave 8 of ELSA. Our novel questions will provide new insights into the role of grandparents in family life in England- a critical issue given increasing pressures on older people to engage in both paid work and care in later life. Currently no information is collected on grandparents in England that enable us to answer the many pressing questions about the frequency, intensity and periodicity of grandparental childcare and to make international comparisons.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BEB5A47C-631B-4712-82FE-9152F7883053</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546244be3ab502.75294181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Overall, our evidence suggests a positive relationship between grandparental childcare and health over time using SHARE. While cross-sectional analyses show that those who are not looking after grandchildren, and those who are looking after grandchildren intensively, are more likely to report poor health in comparison to those who look after grandchildren non-intensively, longitudinal analyses show that those who provide grandchild care (particularly those providing non-intensive childcare) are significantly less likely to report poor health. Our findings using SHARE support recent work in China and Taiwan that also suggests that providing grandchild care at lower intensity levels is positively related to health whereas higher intensity care levels is negatively associated. 

A key focus of our study was an examination of the link between grandparental childcare and health taking into account prior health status as well as socio-economic circumstances across the life course. As our cross-sectional analyses using SHARE show that those in more disadvantaged circumstances are more likely to end up providing intensive grandchild care, it was necessary to rule out that the association between grandparental childcare and health was due to this earlier disadvantage rather than to grandchild care per se. However, once prior health status and lifecourse circumstances are taken into account, grandparental childcare (and in particular non-intensive grandchild care) still shows a positive relationship with health in SHARE. This finding points to the need for public policy to support the role of grandparents as care givers for their grandchildren, at non-intensive levels. At the moment the informal caring role of grandparents especially grandmothers is largely hidden. There is a need for better recognition of this vital role across different policy domains, including pensions and retirement, childcare, housing and social security. Policies to support active ageing need to explicitly recognise and value older people's involvement in their grandchildren's lives, both for the benefit of children, their families and wider families, but also because of the benefits for older people's health and wellbeing.

The difference between our results and work from the U.S., which shows a negative impact of grandparental childcare on health, is most likely due to the measure of grandchild care used. In the U.S., as previously discussed, most studies focus on higher intensity levels of care, for example, grandparents who are 'primary caregivers' for their grandchildren. Evidence from China also suggests that grandparents who provide higher intensity levels of care (that is, grandparents who coreside with their grandchildren and provide 15 or more hours of care per week) are more likely to experience health declines. 

In addition, although in our analysis of SHARE we take into account prior health status and earlier socio-economic circumstances, several important indicators are missing which are also likely to affect who provides care. For example, we do not have a measure of the quality of the relationship between grandparents, their children and grandchildren. This is likely to affect which grandparent is selected to look after grandchildren, which in turn is likely to be related to health in later life.

In our cross-sectional examination of ELSA we find that living with a grandchild is negatively associated with QoL whereas looking after a grandchild in the past week shows a positive relationship. However, in longitudinal analyses once prior QoL is taken into account the relationship between these two measures and grandparental health is no longer significant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings are being used by Grandparents Plus to inform policy and practice.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>43A14531-3802-4C1D-ACDB-81E7CAFF2D4F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54646795ed0849.12298562</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.grandparentsplus.org.uk/health-impacts-of-caring</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Inclusion of grandparent questions we designed based on our resarch to be included in future waves of ELSA, nationally representative sample of older people 50+</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D46226AA-753B-4C86-B1CA-023610763AA6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A series of questions on grandparents that we created and designed, based on our research, will now be included in a future wave of a nationally representative survey of older people in England (ELSA).
