This is leading to a dual burden of disease as these countries try to tackle high levels of both infectious and chronic non-communicable diseases.||The primary causes of obesity (inactivity and the over-consumption of energy-dense foods) are largely self-evident. However, the nature of the links between obesity and chronic disease, and the factors leading to individual differences in susceptibility, are not yet understood. ||This project focuses on the linkage between obesity and NIDDM since this is particularly strong. New lines of evidence have suggested that insulin resistance, and ultimately NIDDM, are mediated by endocrine actions of an expanded adipose tissue mass. Chronic (sub-clinical) inflammation also appears to be a strong predictor of the development of incident NIDDM. Inflammatory cytokines (especially TNFa and IL-6) have been proposed as important mediators. This theory provides a potential link between the adipose tissue and inflammatory mechanisms. Our particular interest is in the possibility that these processes are influenced by the n6/n3 ratio in polyunsaturated dietary fatty acids (PUFAs). We have two studies in progress to test aspects of this theory in different urban settings of a developing country (Gambia) and emergent country (Chile).||The Gambia: A pilot study is testing the effects of a 6-month dietary fat intervention on measures of insulin resistance in obese middle-aged urban women with existing evidence of impaired glucose tolerance. Women are randomised to receive food oils containing high levels of n3 PUFAs (canola) plus fish oil capsules versus oils containing high levels of n6 PUFAs (sunflower) with placebo capsules. Outcome measures include indices of insulin sensitivity and inflammatory cytokines.||Chile: This study uses a nested-case control study to investigate whether the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is predicted by the fatty acid profile of plasma and erythrocyte membranes and by markers of inflammation in early pregnancy. Older, obese urban women are recruited in early gestation and followed longitudinally until they become either cases or controls.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2000-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172008</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U123261405</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D81A471F-556F-4570-BF6A-5D197943223C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Oral and Gastrointestinal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>5841ECCD-C9B1-4B8B-993F-ACC8E9585125</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>12</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.1  Primary preventions interventions to modify behaviours or promote well-being</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>3BEA012A-C817-4067-8BE1-05331EBB5152</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.2  Evaluation of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>74DC189C-F240-42D1-84DD-85475A95ABE8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>38</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.7  Physical</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
