The three questions that we have been asked to address are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>The different drivers for why countries like India and China want to invest and what are the barriers to entry eg finance, skills, visibility of information.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To further understand who gains from inward investment in both business and social contexts. This is from both the point of view of the inward investor and that of the host locality eg we gain economic and social improvements coming from investor ethos?s in training/skill development, and the investor gains manufacturing know how, R&amp;amp;D and new product development, process improvement etc.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What&amp;nbsp; existing investors see&amp;nbsp; as the positives of FDI (eg availability of skills base, supply chain, target markets, support available)&amp;nbsp; and what lessons could be learnt&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The chief impact of this study will be a greater understanding of the benefits of inward investment, and how these benefits relate to the wider features of the local economy. While the focus of this will be in the greater Birmingham region, the impacts will translate to the other parts of the greater Birmingham LEP, and through the work of Business Birmingham to their clients in other parts of the UK.
The primary beneficiaries of the project will be policy makers within the Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP, and within Birmingham City Council, who are seeking to better target both funding and marketing activity related to the attraction of inward investment for two purposes:
1. To attract firms who will generate the greatest returns in terms of additionality.
2. To identify sectors that will both attract inward investment, and gain the most from it.
The main users play not only a key role in the project, but have a pivotal role in impact. Not only are they responsible for policy formulation in what is currently the largest single LEP in the country, but they are also advising others. The main impact will be for the project to answer the questions posed by the users, it will also inform the discussions within stakeholders such as newly created Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) about likely gains from greater exposure to inward investment from emerging countries. This will build on our findings from RES-062-23-0986 on outward FDI from emerging countries (published in Journal of International Business Studies) on what motivates such firms to engage in FDI, and how potential investors can be identified. Specifically, we envisage the following:
(1) Business Birmingham undertake the inward investment role for the Greater Birmingham LEP. However, Driffield is a member of the Economic Strategy Board of the greater Birmingham LEP, so the impact will therefore be an analysis of what motivates firms to invest in the region, and how this investment can be leveraged to generate greater benefits. 
(2) Birmingham City Council: As part of their Total Place activities (http://www.bebirmingham.org.uk) Birmingham City Council need to much better target public expenditure, and to focus activity on that with the greatest impact. This involves not only an analysis of individual returns to certain activities, but also how the impacts of these activities relate to each other. A feature of this is the collaboration between the two main users on the issues around inward investment, and their interest in this project for providing the answers.
(3) Economic Development Units of Councils: The LEP economic strategy board is comprised of the heads of economic development of the constituent local councils. As such, the results will feed down to micro users, as well as to national users.

(4) BIS and UKTI: The research output would feed into the policy debates at BIS (about reigniting growth in the UK) and the UKTI (about greater trade with and attracting investment from) the BRICS countries (and large emerging markets in general). Bhaumik has worked closely with BIS on productivity growth over business cycles, and BIS has, in the past, supported his research proposals to funding agencies. Bhaumik and Driffield have also worked with UKTI on the number of projects, including one on internationalisation and firm growth in the UK. They would, therefore, be able to engage BIS and UKTI policy makers by way of workshops, seminars and policy notes.
(5) International organisations: Driffield will leverage his professional relationship with the OECD and UNCTAD to inform the international debate about the growing global economic role of the BRICS countries.
(6) Academic Community: Aston will host the 2013 annual conference of the Association of International Business (UK &amp;amp; Ireland), and the project can therefore partly influence the theme of the conference, and engage the academic community through appropriate special sessions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90138</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sectors offering most potential to explore international market</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F95BFA39-ED4F-41F3-A72A-CC3CF2476222</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to the LEP Board and wider steering group, including MPs MEPs and members of the House of Lords

. This addresses the issue in terms of firm and sector performance, measured not merely in terms of inward investment attraction, but exporting performance, outward FDI and innovation, as indicators of the ability of sectors to assimilate new technology.
It is also important to distinguish the motives for firms entering a given location, and the Aston report highlights the sectors which are attractive for &amp;quot;technology sourcing&amp;quot; FDI, that is those sectors that are attractive for inward investment in terms of accessing the leading technology that exists locally. This then contrasts with those sectors that attract FDI from firms seeking to exploit their technological advantage over local firms.
This distinction becomes important in terms of the likely effects of inward investment, comparing for example the types of employment that are generated and the productivity growth it is likely to generate.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>the same approach can be applied to other LEPS and city regions</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6195575F-5CB6-44C1-9FE5-A28C7D7AC2EB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544543908ed4b7.07463455</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://centreofenterprise.com/s/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>54FCD420-1335-45EB-8CC8-FC68C2EA1291</gtr:id><gtr:title>Outward FDI from the United Kingdom and its policy context</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Columbia FDI Profiles</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f12bd6c041d7d5e2aa45e78a7f207eae"><gtr:id>f12bd6c041d7d5e2aa45e78a7f207eae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nigel Driffield (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_4244688912135b38d6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C0C3C5B7-DCF0-44CA-A577-E661F86D6CDB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inward FDI in the United Kingdom and its policy context</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Columbia FDI Profiles</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f12bd6c041d7d5e2aa45e78a7f207eae"><gtr:id>f12bd6c041d7d5e2aa45e78a7f207eae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nigel Driffield (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_7466656886135b3818</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J020583/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
