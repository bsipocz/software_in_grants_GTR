 * owners of data which have potential for re-use for social and economic research
 * users of these types of data
Users are expected to come to the UK Data Service's website to search and browse for data collections created by a wide range of suppliers, including government data, data from ESRC-funded research projects, and will be able to access or download these data for their own use. The Service will rely on user registration to enhance our ability to tailor the needs of users and to ensure that licensing arrangements are correctly managed. (In the intervening period between the submission of this proposal and the new award, there will be a complete review of all the data collections currently held under the ONS-Special Licence. This review will remove this form of licence, therefore, all data currently available through this mechanism will either be available through our near-Open End User Licence or controlled through Secure Lab.) We shall continue to advocate Open access to relevantly classified datasets, while ensuring that access to personal data is maintained through the provision of secure access to sensitive data for trusted and Approved Researchers. 

The five years of this award, are likely to see some of the most significant changes in sharing government data --- all of which have a significant impact on the UK Data Service --- the review of the Approved Researcher status has the potential to broaden use of our Secure Lab; the Digital Economy Bill (currently in Parliament) is likely to widen the range of data we have deposited from government and the change of policy of the ADRN to allow the retention of data means that the UK Data Service is one of the most likely places for these data to be maintained. The timescale for some of these activities is clear and we can plan for; for others, we shall have to be responsive to external factors.

For the Service to provide long-term access to data, the highest levels of digital repository and digital preservation techniques will be applied; and the Service shall conform to the relevant national and international standards to ensure the highest quality service.

Audience
Stakeholders
Public - protection of data.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of the UKDS will be data creators, data owners, data users (including those who will use data and the Service for either research or teaching and learning), a wide range of funders, and the wider data service-providing community.
* Data owners, whether academic researchers or external organisations will benefit directly as data which they create will be accessible and usable over the long term. Some will benefit directly though our QA and metadata creation activities. They will benefit indirectly as they will not have to manage and curate their data after deposit. UKDS will protect their reputation by ensuring data integrity and allowing research findings to be verified and validated.
* Data creators will gain the same impact as data owners, but additionally will benefit from research data management guidance, which may lower research costs and ensures that data will not need to be recreated, and the availability of methodological documentation which will reduce research costs.
* Data creators and owners will benefit from promotional activities leading to increased visibility though impact stories, lower overheads on answering user enquiries, feedback on data quality and information on data use.
* As data users, researchers will benefit from seamless access to data and support, at no cost, and form an indirect element of policy impact. Secure access will ensure availability of data which would not be accessible otherwise. Teachers and learners will gain from availability of data for teaching and enhanced resources which will improve research methods teaching and advanced training. Users will also benefit from the UKDS's provision of a large and heterogeneous research data collection, inspiring new areas of research.
* Funders: the ESRC is already at the forefront of data provision, driving forward social science research, and providing social, political, and policy impact through the re-use of data. The ESRC will be a direct beneficiary of UKDS as it will widen use and re-use of both data and methodologies improving research quality and lowering costs. It will gain indirectly from quality ingest practices which will prevent future costs of re-ingest and preservation. Benefits will also accrue to the ESRC and the wider community through the delivery and promotion of good practice; indirectly it will benefit from the impact of quality data management training which protects returns on ESRC investments.
The ESRC and the wider community will benefit by the UKDS's promotion of the value of research data integrity and the repurposing and re-use of data. The UKDS's re-purposing of data for new audiences will benefit the community more generally and increase the audience for data use. The UKDS will assist in enhancing a skills base, alongside ESRC's other major investments. All stakeholders will benefit by the provision of a national trusted repository infrastructure which influences other data service practitioners. Other direct benefits will include, the stimulation of new networks and collaborations amongst data users, improving scholarly communication and motivating new research as a result of data availability. It may seem obvious, but the greatest impact of the UKDS will be its ability to provide research opportunities by ensuring data is available on demand. The benefits discussed here make no account of the potential benefits to the economic and social development of the UK, but data users in this context know no bounds. A researcher in the academy may carry out research on behalf of a government department or the third sector; so the direct benefits to the data user theoretically will become indirect benefits to 'external' parties, like the UKDS.
The actions to realise the benefits and impacts of the service are built into this proposal, some will be able to be quantifiably assessed during the lifetime of the service, and some will rely on case-based evidence.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16388283</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P008437/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9DD86EE2-EE6B-432E-AEE0-0C8669A1CBB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library &amp; information studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0A982A4A-12CF-4734-AFCA-A5DC61F667F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Information &amp; Knowledge Mgmt</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
