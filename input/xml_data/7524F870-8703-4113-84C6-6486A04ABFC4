The project includes researchers from dance and HCI, alongside those from archaeological computing, psychology, prosthetics, cultural theory, digital media sociology and mathematics, each bringing other disciplinary understandings of human/computer interfaces to the critical debate. This Network is needed because HCI's recent engagement with embodiment is still in its relative infancy, acknowledging the benefits of including discourses and practices from performance and dance but yet to realise their full potential. Body-based methods like bodystorming (physically enacting the experience of using imagined interfaces in order to envisage solutions) are now commonly used to create effective design to 'make things work better' for human engagement. Yet these creative approaches are focused heavily on solution-finding that prioritises the body over technology, rather than problem-seeking that explores the experiences and possibilities of body-technology interactions. In contrast, dance methods are valued for allowing contingency, the unexpected and the unplanned to develop new creative outcomes. The dialogue between the disciplines will explore how the embodied knowledge of the dancer and the methods that dancers employ within their creative processes illuminate relationships between human and machine, leading to potentially new insights about embodied knowledge in HCI. Similarly, investigation of concepts of error, 'noise' and glitches in digital code offers new possibilities for creative processes in dance choreography. 

The Network will host two workshop laboratories during which all participants will engage in practical experimentations in both dance and human-computer interaction design. These activities will develop shared languages and understandings of the methods, issues and concerns within these fields, so that intersections and cross-overs between them can be interrogated in more detail. Such workshop-based methods have proven highly successful in previous AHRC, EPSRC and JISC-funded projects involving the PI and Co-I, leading to profitable debate between dance and computing/engineering academics. The Network will culminate in a symposium, which will engage a broader cross-disciplinary community including industry professionals from the field of dance, the field of digital media, and those whose work combines the two. The symposium will include practice-based dissemination as well as oral presentations in order to share the findings effectively across disciplines and with academic and industry delegates. The Network will also produce a minimum of two peer-reviewed research journal papers aimed at different disciplinary audiences and it will lead to the development of a larger project to pursue specific areas of interest arising from the research. A project website will collate and disseminate documentation from the Network activities, including details of practical exercises that might be useful to researchers in both academy and industry. Social media will be employed during the workshop laboratories to share the research findings as they unfold, and to encourage debate with wider communities. This Network falls under the highlight notice for the exploration of innovative areas of cross-disciplinary enquiry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The PI, Co-I and some Network members have significant experience of working with industry partners. Some Network members also have extensive industry experience prior to moving into full-time academia (Ruth Gibson) or are currently industry professionals (Bruno Martelli). This places the team particularly advantageously to maximise impact on this project. The University of Leeds has excellent structures for supporting impact activities, with each department having its own Director of Impact and Innovation, supported by a sector-facing Cultural and Creative Industries hub across the two arts and humanities faculties together with a Business Development Manager and team.

Martelli's participation in the Network will bring industry perspectives to the heart of the research and will ensure that industry-relevant questions are raised throughout the project. This will ensure that the findings include impactful knowledge that will be taken directly into industry usage through Martelli's own professional work. 

The project symposium will include industry professionals from the Network team's extensive range of collaborators. The venue for the symposium will be Leeds, as the city and region has extensive industry communities both in dance and in digital media. This will make it relatively easy and cost-effective for a significant number of individuals working in these industries to attend the event. One of the keynote speakers will be an industry professional (Siobhan Davies, choreographer) and the other works regularly in collaboration with industry (Professor Steve Benford, Nottingham University). Connections into local professional organisations and networks via Yorkshire Dance, Leeds City Council and the Leeds University Cultural and Creative Industries hub will be used to ensure wide dissemination of the invitation to attend the symposium. The creative opportunities for error and ambiguity and methods for collaboration with multiple disciplines will be explored and debate will be encouraged across professionals and academics from a variety of disciplinary areas. Practical workshops and discussions will be employed to ensure maximum engagement for delegates from all backgrounds.

The presentations to Yorkshire Dance and DanceHE will be important points of dissemination to the Dance professional community. These presentations will address both topics of the Network: the use of error for creative purposes and methods for collaborative research between dance and science/technology specialists. Yorkshire Dance has several thousand members across the Yorkshire counties and its mission includes &amp;quot;raising standards, increasing knowledge and understanding and fostering creativity and innovation&amp;quot; for dance professionals and audiences in the region. There is a strong relationship between University of Leeds and Yorkshire Dance, and Popat (PI) is currently working on a NESTA/AHRC/ACE-funded research project led by Yorkshire Dance. She has a standing invitation to speak to the community on the subject of dance and new media. DanceHE is primarily an academic network but many of its members are also professional dance practitioners alongside their academic activity. Popat (PI) and Whatley (Co-I) have spoken about dance and impact at a number of DanceHE events in last three years.

The website/blog will be used to disseminate research findings, visual recordings and descriptions of the exercises used in the workshop laboratories. Martelli and Gibson will ensure that the materials are accessible and useful for industry audiences. Facebook and Twitter will be used to engage non-academic audiences during Network meetings and highlight blog postings throughout the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35572</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Error and Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F8246A08-6F9C-4835-BE9C-FD0B70B7DC62</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In December 2016, 50 delegates from academia and industry signed up for the Error and Creativity Symposium, coming from a mix of disciplines including dance, drama, computer science, engineering, medical humanities, medicine, life sciences, English, and other backgrounds. The event was hosted in Leeds and delegates came from Leeds, Sheffield, York, Manchester and London, as well as Sweden and Denmark. Keynote speakers were Steve Benford (Professor of Computer Science, Mixed Reality Lab, Nottingham University) and Efva Lilja (Director of Dansehellerne Theatre and Studios, Copenhagen, Denmark), both with extensive experience of working in or with industry as well as in academia. The Symposium challenged delegates to consider error as a creative tool, and to explore through presentations and workshops how error and ambiguity might be engaged productively in a variety of disciplinary and cross-disciplinary contexts. A follow-up meeting will be held in June 2016 to plan future related activities, and a book proposal on multi- and cross-disciplinary methodologies for employing error creatively has been offered to Palgrave.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589d91d7e7e058.88949715</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Error Network participant workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>84EF7D7B-6B38-4F9A-B687-24227346C6EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In September 2016, 10 Error Network participants (9 academics and 1 industry professional) met in Sweden at the Malmo Inter Arts Centre for a 3-day intensive workshop laboratory, exploring error and ambiguity as creative tools in multi-disciplinary contexts. The group included representatives from the disciplines of dance, engineering, psychology, medicine, fine art, computer science, drama and archaeology. Each participant gave a workshop, demonstration or presentation about how error figures in their specialist area, and the group debated definitions of terms and intersections of approaches and ideas across the disciplines. Planning was undertaken for the Network's final event in December 2016, titled Error and Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Symposium, to which delegates from academia and industry would be invited.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589d93b75fdfe5.90061339</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has brought together 12 disciplinary specialists from the arts and sciences to discuss perspectives on error and its productive potential, particularly in relation to creativity. These specialists have met on three separate occasions to participate in workshop laboratories, involving combinations of practical engagement and discussion. Early findings indicate that error is increasingly perceived as having productive and/or creative potential in all of the disciplines represented in the group (dance, visual arts, computer science, engineering, medicine, archaeology, psychology). There are commonalities across the disciplines in their approaches to error that indicate the potential for useful multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration on related methodologies. However, there are discrepancies in language and detail that need to be understood for effective communication to support such collaborations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Error Network project had originally intended to produce two journal articles. However, the research process has demonstrated that a more effective form of output would be an edited book presenting disciplinary perspectives on the productivity of error and then exploring commonalities and differences in order to propose methodologies for effective multi- and interdisciplinary collaboration. Palgrave Macmillan has indicated interest in publishing this edition, and we are currently awaiting peer review comments on the proposal. The findings in this book could be useful to researchers and practitioners wanting to engage in multi-, cross- or interdisciplinary collaborations with an appreciation of how error can stimulate and support creativity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AFFE7A1B-525C-4549-8383-13545395A4D4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bdc679be8b43.56113567</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N001400/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7B8CDA14-FE2F-4F7C-BCD4-87F84927DAC0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dance</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
