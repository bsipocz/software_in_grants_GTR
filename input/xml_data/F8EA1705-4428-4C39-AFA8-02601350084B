In order to use QM accurately in a chemical system (known as quantum chemistry), we need to understand how the electrons interact with the nuclei of the atoms in a molecule, and with each other. 

The problem is that the equations of QM cannot be solved exactly for systems with more than one electron, and so mainstream computational quantum chemistry is built on approximate one-electron models that treat the electron-electron interactions in an average way. However, electrons interact instantaneously and so their motion is correlated. The difference between these two approaches is known as 'electron correlation'. We cannot ignore electron correlation because the correlation energy is similar in size to the energy of making or breaking chemical bonds. Every system to which we apply quantum chemistry needs cheaper, accurate, methods for calculating this critical interaction. 

The first part of this proposal involves accurately calculating the electron correlation of the basic model system of two electrons and a nucleus, via an elegant series solution method. This method adds several advantages in that it is extremely computationally efficient and accurate. We will calculate highly accurate electron correlation data to develop a full understanding of how electrons interact, even at long range.

The second part of this proposal involves using this new, highly accurate, correlation data to develop one of the most widely used techniques in the chemical sciences, density functional theory (DFT). DFT is currently used to provide new knowledge, and to support experimental studies, in areas ranging from nanomaterials and mineralogy to biomolecules and drug discovery. Its success derives from its unique balance of computational speed and reliability, but as DFT is stretched to more complex and exotic chemical regimes, the flaws of key underlying approximations begin to show. This puts a limit on the complexity of systems addressable by current DFT. In this work, we will design and develop two new correlation functionals for use in DFT, by fitting innovative new forms to the new highly accurate data. The first will be based on a form that accurately models electron correlation at all points from the weak to the strong electron correlation limit. The second involves an entirely new functional form. The advantage these new functionals aim to bring is increased accuracy, not only for standard applications, but also for more complex and/or exotic chemical regimes, and for systems where long-range, low-density behavior is prominent, e.g. graphene or 2-D quantum dots. Successful functionals will be implemented in the Molpro computational chemistry package so that computational scientists worldwide can gain access to high accuracy methods for use in their own cutting-edge research, enhancing the discovery of new knowledge for direct applications in the real world.

The final part of this proposal involves writing new code to model excited states of three-body systems. It will include directly the electron-electron distance to model accurately the correlated motion of the electrons, and the motion of the nucleus. This will enable us to probe the electron dynamics in excited states and to calculate spectroscopic properties with nuclear motion included. Spectroscopy is an important technique in many areas of science: including atmospheric chemistry, astrochemistry, and astrophysical observations and thus can help us understand e.g. the greenhouse effect and structure of the universe. A particular emphasis will be on Rydberg atoms (large orbit atoms), as these are extremely topical in quantum computing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A key driver of the proposed research is to develop accurate correlation data, with a particular emphasis on electron correlation in the low-density regime. Electron correlation is fundamental to the accurate modelling of many processes, in fact any process which involves the interaction of electrons, for example the very core of chemistry: chemical bonding. The proposal has three main projects:

1. The development of high accuracy correlation data. The main impact of this research is &amp;quot;Knowledge&amp;quot; and the main beneficiaries &amp;quot;Academics&amp;quot;. The data will serve as important benchmark data for the theoretical chemistry community for assessing new method developments, and is needed for the design of new correlation functionals fit for low density and/or low dimensionality systems.

2. The design of new correlation functionals for use with Density Functional Theory (DFT). The main impact of this research is &amp;quot;Knowledge&amp;quot; but has the potential to impact on &amp;quot;Society&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Economy&amp;quot; if the successful correlation functionals, when incorporated within the DFT method, prove to be high performing across a range of systems. The impact will be delivered through the end-user applications and we plan for the new correlation functionals to be incorporated within the Molpro and entos electronic structure packages. The former is used at over 800 institutions worldwide, and the latter is being developed by the Co-I in consultation with researchers in Caltech, Toyota Central R &amp;amp; D Labs, BASF and Dow Chemicals, ensuring development of a platform with direct industrial applicability. Already DFT impacts on a staggering breadth of areas across science and technology the goal here is to broaden the scope by designing a functional to be accurate at low density, away from equilibrium and for low dimensional structures. This may also impact on excited state applications using adiabatic time-dependent DFT, which uses ground state (time/frequency independent) XC functionals.

3. A new correlated method for excited states of three-body systems. The main impact of this research is &amp;quot;Knowledge&amp;quot; through method development and computational techniques for probing excited states. Fundamental studies such as these play an important role in understanding the very nature of matter that we try to control in scientific and technological advances, such as using Rydberg states as logic gates in quantum computers. Furthermore, spectroscopy is a key tool in addressing many issuing facing our society, such as global warming. Thus it has the potential, long-term and indirectly, to contribute significantly to &amp;quot;Society&amp;quot;.

Additionally, the highly skilled PDRA (and undergraduate MChem project students that will join the group each year) will lead ultimately to wealth creation through the applications of the transferable skills base provided by this research. At the end of the grant period, the PDRA will be skilled in software development and computer programming, with specific knowledge of modern quantum chemistry methods, computational chemistry software, HPC environments, numerical methods and simulation techniques, as well as being a highly scientifically literate member of society. By linking technical expertise and access to resources between the two universities we will generate synergy and an enhanced research environment that will not only further the scientific aims but will also expose the PDRA to a wide range of theoretical methods and hence equip them for future careers in industry or academia. Additionally, the PDRA will gain experience in project management and supervision, which together with the technical skills they will acquire, will enhance their career development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>363386</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R011265/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>666CC8F4-4525-49AF-91C1-5675E0C8ADDF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chem.
