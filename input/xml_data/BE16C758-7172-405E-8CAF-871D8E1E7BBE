BBSRC funded research at The University of Nottingham over the past five years has been looking at the technical barriers behind the conversion of agricultural residues (such as wheat straw) into fuels such as ethanol. This research has developed a range of techniques to handle waste biomass streams and highlighted the need to generate higher value products in addition to energy. This has been accompanied by research, funded by Innovate UK, into alternate waste streams and products. This fundamental research has identified a number of potential high value products from a range of waste streams arising from the food industry. It has also developed techniques to extract, purify and concentrate these products. Overcoming these technical barriers to the exploitation of waste is only the first step in the process. Commercial implementation is subject to another range of barriers such as capital costs to establish the process; cost effectiveness of the process; considerations of intellectual property and potential disruption to the current operations. 
This FLIP application is to allow a research fellow, who has been primarily responsible for this basic research at Nottingham, to spend a period of 18 months with New Food Innovation Ltd (NFI). NFI is a small company that provides a conduit and consultation role for the introduction of novel products and processes into the food industry. The company has an extensive network of contacts within the industry and has expertise in all areas related to the commercial exploitation of research. The company will provide the fellow with training in aspects of commercial exploitation. At the same time the fellow will develop business plans for those waste streams and products that have been identified from the preliminary research. These include the extraction and purification of proteins from potato waste and brewers spent grain that may have functionality in structuring foods. Another example is the preparation of pulp material from fruit waste that may have functionality in food structuring due to its high water retention properties. A small part of the placement will include the fellow visiting other research groups (at Nottingham and elsewhere) to help identify other potential waste streams and products. 
This FLIP will deliver a range of benefits to the interchanger and the partners. The interchanger, who is already skilled in the technical aspects of the research, will receive training and gain an appreciation of the equally important commercial barriers and how they may be assessed and crossed. This will benefit and inform their future research activities. Nottingham University, and the PI in particular, will be able to explore potential &amp;quot;pipelines to exploitation&amp;quot; for the existing research portfolio that it has accumulated and, along with other institution, identify other areas of investigation. NFI will have access to new technologies and products that they can assess and as appropriate help transfer these into the relevant industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Not applicable general summary covers this</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal for interchange occurs at a time when there is growing interest in the reuse and valorisation of agri-food process waste. Recently the BBSRC have set up several relevant Networks (NIBBs) in this area, with which the School of Biosciences has associations, namely- FoodWasteNet, Integrated Plant to Product technologies and High Value Chemicals from Plants. The interchanger will use these and other industry platforms both as a learning and knowledge gathering opportunity, for dissemination of results from the FLIP scheme, and also for networking with industry and commercial organisations. The rapid development of interest in waste valorisation means that opportunities exist for companies to establish an early market position and to secure new intellectual property for commercial advantage. The scheme therefore is proposed at a timely moment where current and proposed initiatives at New Food Innovation and the University can be speedily brought forward. The need for effective organisation at the interface between the university research sector and the commercial innovation sector has been highlighted by the BBSRC as part of the NIBB strategy and the BBSRC strategy on Reducing Waste in the Food Chain. The aims and objectives for the proposed scheme are fully consistent with these strategies and wider Government strategies as highlighted in the House of Lords report &amp;quot;Waste or Resource?: Stimulating a Bioeconomy&amp;quot; (March 2014).

The scheme will complement and enhance existing relationships between Nottingham University, NFI and external companies, allowing further opportunities for knowledge transfer and the valorisation of university intellectual property. The scheme is ideally positioned to impact on the University of Nottingham strategic vision, as highlighted in the recently published Food and Drink Capability Statement. The scheduled time spent by the interchanger in the university will enable proposals for new exploratory of pump-priming funding to be progressed in the biorefining/ biotechnology / biomaterials areas, managed by the interchanger and academic colleagues. This will lead to longer term research in the School and beyond and a strengthening of the research base.

The partner organisation will gain from the increased staff resource devoted to these exciting opportunities for innovation in the food-agri sector. The scheme will allow increased focus on the needs and interests of the client base in this industry sector and the extension of relationships with the university. The knowledge and experience gained by the Interchanger will be assimilated by the NFI team and will strengthen the position of the company in the biorefining and food-waste area, valuable for consultancy and technology transfer activities. New models for commercialisation of processes for valorisation of food waste will be embedded as development tools for the company, which will be replicated in different commercial scenarios within the wider industry.

The reduction of waste in the agri and food-processing industries is recognised as a key strategic objective for the UK economy. More than 20% of usable food-agri materials may be diverted during processing (wrap.org.uk), which represents a large underutilised resource, both in terms of food security and also lost value to the industry sector and to other down-stream sectors. The UK legislative framework (EU Waste Framework directive) is also directing businesses away from disposal of waste to landfill and towards more sustainable operation of processes and recycling of materials. The development and replication of new strategies for bio-refinery processes will therefore directly help the agri-food sector to move in the direction of a bio-based economy and will also provide momentum in other business sectors to move towards more sustainable operations with lower environmental impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121188</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>290000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BESTF2</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Department of Energy and Climate Change</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>FCC94443-9ECE-46B6-AF5B-E78DD88FC95B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ad9a77566982.59940655</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N003926/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C7A88EDD-F02E-4CF4-B7E9-E33C946EBD49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8EB9BB59-B7EF-4C3B-9170-233BADFF3D7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food structure/composition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
