Yet there is no systematic investigation of the intersections of these fields and their significance for society.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project examines the development and application of innovative biomedical technologies relevant to musculoskeletal injury, enabling analysis of two types of questions. Against a mapping of emerging interactions between sports and biomedicine, the research asks, first: What are the effects of sports patronage and collaboration on biomedical innovation, and conversely, how does biomedical research and innovation impact on elite sports and its athletes? Second, the research sets out to clarify the ethical issues raised by these developments and how publics and stakeholders understand and evaluate them (including the 'human enhancement' debate).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A multi-method research design sets the study in the context of sports in general, focusing on football (soccer) and cycling as case studies because of their different funding regimes and injury profiles. Data are collected via documents, interviews, and observation methods (eg at sports' medical conferences). We undertake ethical analysis and public engagement comprising deliberative interactive online debate and focus groups to clarify issues of concern, and to inform and elicit public opinion.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is cross-sectoral research with correspondingly diverse beneficiaries and impacts. 

The main beneficiaries are:
 - policymakers, entrepreneurs, private and public intermediaries in emerging innovative biomedicine sectors and specifically the sports injury, diagnostic, therapy and rehabilitation marketplace;
- sports institutions, authorities, clubs and their medical and other advisers; 
- service providers such as sports injury and rehabilitation providers, planners and representative bodies in the sports-medicine industries;
- educational institutions (HEIs) and public sector research centres: (1) undertaking scientific and clinical research in molecular diagnostics and regenerative medicine in sports-related applications; (2) providing curricula e.g. in Sports Injury, and in specialist medical training in sports medicine, orthopaedics and rehabilitation;(3) sports law and ethics
-publics; amateur sportsplayers; retired and future elite athletes
- London Olympic 'legacy' actors
- journalists.

Economic sector impact: the research will act as a catalyst for technology and service developers in both public and private sectors who see biomedical technology-related opportunities in the sports injury and rehabilitation field. The research will raise awareness of opportunities for biomedical enterprise, spin-offs, and emerging medical business models, in what is undoubtedly a growing niche sector, and will provide signposts for future trends in the emerging marketplace. The types of commercial and public sector contracts that are developing will be ascertained. We will achieve impact here by short 'Research Highlights' publications, and publication in forums where multiple interests converge such as conferences and the 'Regenerative Medicine' journal. Specific forums and bodies in football and cycling will be targeted.

Policy impacts: the research cuts across two main UK government policy departments, namely the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Short briefing reports are an appropriate medium through which to achieve a minimum of impact on policymakers' radar here. Looking to longer term impacts, and given general concerns about policy silos, we will engage users in a focused way by convening a future-oriented cross-sectoral workshop of these and other stakeholders, to embed the research in policy debates and to examine the lessons for potential policy intervention for the innovative therapies/sports sector, taking account of ethical perspectives. 

Impact on society and publics: The research will also impact on public 'issues' in elite sports that are the subject of debate and controversy, including the player implications of globalisation and commercial exploitation of sports, clubs and players; 'premature ageing'; the lifecourse effects of sports injury and athlete wellbeing; and the enhancement/regeneration debate. Our analysis of the institutional intersections between academic and commercial medical enterprise and sports' institutions/practices will presage future practical developments in 'human enhancement', and our ethical analysis will clarify provide a model for public and stakeholder debates. To achieve impact here we will place the research findings and ethical appraisal in the public domain through narrow and broadcast media, including securing the interest of appropriate specialist journalists in the broadcast media.

The research impact will be sustained through the use of a dedicated, multimedia, updated website with a 'visitor book' comment/feedback facility, and a range of high-quality academic social science, policy-oriented and public outputs. Our advisory group which has expertise and key positions in academic sports-related biomedical and clinical science and in sports policy will act as embedded users of the research, providing direct linkage into academic, public and private sector user networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>437471</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Canterbury Christ Church University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Co-convening sessions at 4S/EASST Conference 2016 on STS and Sport, and planning a journal special issue</gtr:description><gtr:id>C54B5AA4-391E-4C1D-B78D-4B19DCF2DF18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary - medical sociology, science &amp;amp; technology studies, and sociology of sport

Purpose is
1. to disseminate latest scientific research about novel therapies to professional practitioners and others involved in sports medicine and therapy. 
2. To provoke reaction about controversial therapies by commenting on headline cases in the news (eg about elite sport person injury) and asking questions about the use and ethics of known or possible therapies used for treatments.

A small number of elite professionals and in the field, and others active in social media have responded with info and opinion.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc462639ce79.15434748</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://biosportproject.org.uk/about</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Debated in several meetings of relevant professional practitioners in 2015</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B39D7830-47F7-4FC3-BFA8-5D5B3035BC42</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dc499ee1f515.76136034</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Several controversial bio-medical therapies are being widely used in elite sports, in spite of lack of scientific evidence to support them.
