The basis of many systems to mitigate
these problems utilise compounds containing hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) as used in: chromic acid anodising (CAA);
chemical conversion coatings; primers; paint, and hard chrome plating (EHC). Corrosion and wear are of particular
importance to the aerospace industry where protection requirements are extremely severe. European REACH legislation is
expected to ban the use of Cr6+ containing materials by 2016 due to its carcinogenic properties. This is a critical issue for
the aerospace industry and has been highlighted as a priority in the 2011 National Aerospace Technology Strategy. A
number of attempts have been made to introduce Cr6+ free materials and processes. The solutions have been found not to
be as robust as expected, due in part, to the lack of validated, accelerated testing methods, resulting in unexpected
failures. Individual aerospace companies are developing their own, proprietary solutions. This has caused problems in the
supply chain, which it is finding difficult to support. This bid addresses this situation by bringing together an integrated
aerospace based team from SMEs to academia to identify innovative solutions and develop robust accelerated testing
methods that accurately reproduce severe environmental applications. This will enable the sector to adopt a common</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is capable of delivering impact as it brings together a team including academia, SMEs and OEMs in the
aerospace sector, in a fully integrated, structured, science-based, systems approach to the development of testing methods
and materials processes in an area that has traditionally been developed on an empirical basis. This has not been
attempted before in this area and will result in innovative test methods, materials and processes being developed and a
significant up skilling of the sector. This approach will capture this knowledge in a useable form for the future and makes it
widely available outside of the aerospace sector. In terms of measurable impact, the main beneficiaries from the proposed
study will initially be the consortium OEM's and first tier companies that are within the aerospace sector. As best practice in
terms of testing is disseminated and more widely adopted, then other industries will benefit from the standardised and
reliable corrosion and wear test methodologies generated from this research. Such materials testing protocols will lead to
reductions in materials testing costs and shorter times-to-market for future coatings. The validation of Cr6+ free coatings
will impact upon both the aerospace and, also eventually, other key industrial sectors such as automotive and defence that
also require similar processes. Key benefits to the aerospace sector will be the specification of new coatings for use on
their products. Those who have their own processing facilities will be able to set up the capability to produce the new
coatings. The specialist processing companies, including SMEs, will be able to set up facilities to provide these coatings
and to provide the materials these process will require. A successful project will result in the removal of Cr6+ surface
coatings from the operating environment which will address the environmental concerns and reduce operating costs.
This research will work towards the aim of the elimination of Cr6+ by 2016, as currently proposed under REACH. The
proposed project represents an opportunity for the UK aerospace industry to become leaders in the area of Cr6+
replacement through the development and demonstration of an innovative common testing programme and materials and
process. This research will be underpinned by a science-based understanding at leading universities and acentralised
materials data management architecture. This research will also lead to the potential for development of alternative Cr6+
processes in the partner universities by understanding the failure mechanisms of existing candidates.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>57867</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Functional Coatings For Industry I, II, and III</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E562F3AB-4F17-4718-9CB3-CF436B0F7BB9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I organized seminar Functional Coatings for Industry focused on major issues in the field, such as environmental and legislative pressure (REACh) and energy efficiency. Audience (45 companies, 80 participants) was quite positive and several new proposals and contacts started there.

I personally started collaboration with leading motorsport company and with John Crane (collaborative project).
