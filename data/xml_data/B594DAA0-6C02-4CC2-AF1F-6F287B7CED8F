From motifs and borders, to swathes of colour and texture, almost every 'thing' of value is embellished with a pattern that has been carefully designed to enhance its aesthetic, meaning and function.

We aim to make such decorative patterns interactive so that all manner of everyday objects can become part of the Internet of Things simply by decorating their surfaces. Pointing a camera at a thing (or indeed pointing a thing at a camera) might then enable people to learn about what it is, how it was made, and how to use it; to access personal memories or review their history of use; or to trigger other contextually relevant services.

Our proposal builds on a technology called Aestheticodes that we have already developed and demonstrated through a feasibility project. This enables designers and craftspeople to draw beautiful decorative patterns that contain computer-recognisable visual codes embedded within them. So far, we have implemented the technology to run on smartphones, worked with ceramic designers to produce an initial portfolio of fifteen patterns, and worked with the Busaba Eathai restaurant chain to apply these designs to plates, placemats and menus. These were then deployed in one of their restaurants to demonstrate an enhanced dining experience during London Design Week.

This project will conduct an in the wild study of this technology actually being used in two complementary real world settings so as to learn how interactive decorative patterns can enhance everyday life, understand the challenges of interacting with patterns that contain embedded codes under testing real-world conditions, and establish ways of engaging designers and end-users in designing and reappropriating patterned objects and surfaces. 

Our first setting is Busaba Eathai where we will build on our established collaboration to develop production tableware and a public app to be deployed and used by customers over a period of months. Our second setting is the home, where we will collaborate with Johnson Tiles to produce a range of domestic tiles that will be sold as products in retail outlets. These will come with an invitation to join our research project so that we can employ participatory design methods to create services for enhanced kitchens and bathrooms that users can live with over a period of six months (during which time we will study them) and potentially beyond.

These interventions will produce a series of papers reporting on the experiences and challenges of situating things that are decorated with interactive patterns in wild settings. These will also make broader contributions to discussions of interaction with invisible sensing systems and the design of new tangible materials within Human Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing and related fields. Our project will also produce video documentation of the two case studies, public releases of the apps as well as an open source release of the design tools and supporting libraries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Short-term beneficiaries of this research will include our user groups: through the first trial, Busaba Eathai will obtain beautiful new place-settings and an publicly-released interactive smartphone application through which they can improve engagement with and experience of their customers. Through the second, Johnson Tiles will gain exciting new interactive designs opening up new product possibilities; and selected families will be able to decorate their homes with engaging and aesthetic tiles that will hopefully be a talking point for them for years to come.

Medium term beneficiaries will include researchers working in HCI and interaction design, and product designers more generally: they will have a better understanding of the means by which Internet of Things can be made more humanly acceptable through effective use of aesthetics in design to make currently passive objects interactive.

As a result we anticipate that, long term, we will all benefit from the results of this research. The Internet of Things promises increased interactivity and control over our virtual environments, accessed through physical interactions. Through this research we will enable this while retaining and encouraging a rich design aesthetic for these objects and environments which will enhance all our experiences of living with this future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>359626</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Designs for coaster were created that both match the Busaba visual style and embed artcodes.

We had a large exhibition stall presenting Artcodes (Aestheticodes), teaching visitors to draw their own and running different craft activities. This provided us with the contact details of a range of businesses and professional designers who were interested in further information and making use of Artcodes in future projects.

We created a series of interactive Artcode signs/images placed across the event that could be scanned with the Artcode app by visitors to get more information about the event, different halls and exhibits. This serves as a demonstrator on now Artcodes can be used to guide visitors during large events and helped to promote our technology to the public (with many visitors consequently coming to our stall).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9c1071b6613.81491444</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.londondesignfair.co.uk/news/aestheticode-tent-app</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Professional designers and artists: through the Artcodes app, example artefacts, guidelines and events (such as London Tent at London Design Fair 2015 stand, British Ceramic Bianual 2015 exhibit, Nottingham Writers' Studio Storicodes exhibition, &amp;quot;All Makers Now?&amp;quot; conference presentation and demo, ArcInTex Network Workshop) designers have been supported in creating their own interactive objects and associated experiences. Artists Alice Angus and Simeon Featherstone have already independently used artcodes to create public experiences. (in an artwork inspired by the Lymington Saltmarshes and the Hidden Language Hidden Trails artwork in Dorchester respectively).

Application domains:
- Restaurant service setting - through our collaboration Busaba Eathai have explored scenarios of how Artcode decorated objects can be used to enhance the customer dining experience, new Artcode designs (matching the Busaba branding style) and examples of Artcode decorated objects and training of Busaba staff in designing Artcode patterns 
- Domestic setting (interior design and architecture) - through our collaboration Johnson Tiles have explored scenarios for using interactive tiles in the home and new Artcode designs for tiles (following Johnson Tiles latest trends). We have also engaged with interior designers and architects through events (British Ceramic Biannual 2015 exhibit and The Social: Artcode Workshop) to inspire the use of interactive decorative patterns in the built environment. 
- Cultural sites and museums: through the &amp;quot;Heritage and the Digital Hack Days&amp;quot; (Wollaton Hall) artcodes were promoted to practitioners and professionals who engage the public with heritage and example experiences were created. 

General public: members of the public have learned about how physical objects can be made interactive through artcode decorative patterns, including making their own at events we have organised or exhibited at (London Tent at London Design Fair 2015 stand, British Ceramic Biannual 2015 exhibit, Creative Class at Debbie Bryan Studio &amp;amp; Shop, May Fest 2015) and have been kept up to date with the #aestheticodes tag.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2402B322-F056-4308-8926-96CD18148FE0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e036e63a02a7.09744762</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key findings:
- We have gained a deeper understanding of the process and value of crafting interactive decoration (artcodes) for everyday artefacts. (This involves adorning artefacts with decorative patterns that enhance their beauty while also triggering digital interactions when scanned with mobile cameras.) We have identified new visual design techniques to bridge between human and system interpretations of patterns and new material techniques to account for the materials, forms, structures and functions of artefacts. Our findings also highlight the need for transparent computer vision technologies. (Reported in &amp;quot;Crafting Interactive Decoration&amp;quot; by Benford et al, submitted to ACM ToCHI) 
- We have developed and explored two new techniques that are intended to scale up interactions with visual markers on large surfaces (such as murals, tiled walls, posters, billboards, hoarding and street art) and extend the capabilities of graphic and media designers to create aesthetic designs that are associated with rich digital narratives. The first concerns spatial interactions in which users scan sequences or groups of visual markers that are embedded within the surface decoration, panning across the surface or stepping forwards and backwards to explore a narrative. The second addresses layered interactions in which different layers of visual markers appear to be overlaid on the same location on the surface, with users switching between them as they interact. (Reported in the paper &amp;quot;Exploring Interactive Public Illustrations&amp;quot; by Thorne at al, to be published at ACM DIS 2016)
- We have identified design and interaction issues for this new medium (of making static illustrations and decorations interactive through visual markers) to guide researchers and practitioners in future work. From the designer's perspective these include different strategies for incorporating using spatial and layered interaction, and the flow of the design process. From the interaction perspective these include guidelines around embedding instructions, interaction position, user collaboration, and designing for repeated experiences. (Reported in the paper &amp;quot;Exploring Interactive Public Illustrations&amp;quot; by Thorne at al, to be published at ACM DIS 2016)
- We have extended the capabilities of artcodes (as an example of a topological fiducial marker) by adding geometrical constraints to achieve greater scalability (larger code space), new interaction possibilities and reliability while at the same time retaining openness to designers and inspiring creativity. We also propose seven criterion for the evaluation of topological marker technologies - scalability, the impact on the number of available codes; visual aesthetic, impact on the appearance of the visual design; inspiration, how they inspire creativity in visual design; interaction, what new interactional possibilities they enable; comprehensibility, how easy is it for a designer to understand; reliability and process, how well does it fit into the design process of encoding a code.
