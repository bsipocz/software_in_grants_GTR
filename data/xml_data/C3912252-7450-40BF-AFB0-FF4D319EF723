However, it has usually been argued that while those on the Left sought to carry on the 'unfinished work' of 1960s activists, conservatives used the 1960s as something to rail against - drawing strength and political support by denouncing the decade's radical excess.\n\nPatriotism &amp;amp; Protest goes beyond this narrow analytical framework by using case-studies of the gay rights movement, second-wave feminism, the protests against busing to desegregate schools, the tax revolt and the anti-abortion movement to show how, for Americans of varying political persuasions, the 1960s provided a model for political protest. Indeed, conservative as well as progressive activists took inspiration and claimed legitimacy from 1960s social movements - particularly the civil rights and anti-war struggles - when deploying direct-action tactics (such as marches, sit-ins and boycotts), engaging in civil disobedience, adopting street theatre, and invoking the language of 'rights'. Conservatives also followed the New Left in breaking down divisions between the 'public' and 'private' spheres, by organizing around issues such as schooling and birth control, and arguing that the 'personal was political'. Moreover, conservatives promoted grassroots organizing, a favored tactic of the New Left, with relish; and they used the language of participatory democracy in attacking 'big government' and the power of (liberal) elites. Historians have long recognized the importance of the civil rights, New Left and anti-Vietnam War struggles to subsequent progressive movements for social change, particularly the gay rights movement and second-wave feminism. More recently, scholars have begun to pay some attention to these movements' influence on conservative activism during the 1970s and 1980s. This book builds on this work to show how gay rights protesters, second-wave feminists, opponents of busing, property tax protesters, and anti-abortion activists can all be considered 'children of the sixties'. \n\nThe social movements analysed in this project did not just occupy common ground in drawing on 1960s modes of activism; they also shared a commitment to crafting a language and a style of protest that was rooted firmly in patriotism. Members of the movements for gay and women's rights, anti-abortion and anti-busing activists, and those involved in the tax revolt cited passages from the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, invoked the ideals of the Founding Fathers, expropriated patriotic symbols, and dressed up as the Statue of Liberty or as soldiers from the Revolutionary War. Demonstrating the continuing importance of patriotic protest to American progressives during the 1970s and beyond challenges the prevailing orthodoxy that claims that at the end of the 1960s progressives abandoned patriotism for a rhetorical anti-Americanism.\n\nUltimately, Patriotism &amp;amp; Protest explores the major changes that have taken place in American politics during the last three decades of the twentieth century by focusing not on presidents and politicians, but on the ordinary Americans who were active in social movements - sustaining, shaping and supporting them and, in the process, transforming their country in myriad ways.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research findings of Patriotism &amp;amp; Protest will be of interest to those outside the scholarly community, especially political activists and social movement participants in the contemporary United States. Indeed, my analysis of direct-action protests, the value of grassroots organizing, and the importance of deploying patriotic rhetoric could prove instructive to those seeking to influence political debate in the United States in the early twenty-first century.\n\nThe 1960s, and questions of American patriotism, are issues that are discussed frequently by political, social and cultural commentators. By highlighting continuities between 1960s protesters and the activism of both conservatives and progressives in more recent years, and emphasizing the shared language of Americanism, this project has the potential to feed into contemporary debates about American politics.\n\nWhile of interest to scholars of the United States (based both within the USA and without, including the sizeable British community of Americanists) this project will also interest those who, though not engaged in research in the field, nevertheless take an interest in American politics and seek to understand the political culture of the world's sole superpower more fully. Indeed, the election of Barack Obama to the presidency has re-energised popular interest in U.S. politics and this project will help to strengthen informed awareness of the historical context in which contemporary American progressives and conservatives are rooted.\n\nIn addition to addressing the scholarly community through the publication of a monograph and two articles in refereed journals (in addition to the articles already published), this project will also engage a broader public audience, using both traditional print media and the opportunities afforded by the internet. The plan to write an article for a major news magazine or popular history journal (such as The New Republic or BBC History) which explores the tradition, and importance, of patriotic protest in the United States is aimed at reaching a wider audience. This will build on successful contributions already made, in the form of short articles based on aspects of the research undertaken for Patriotism &amp;amp; Protest that have been published at www.thecommentfactory.com. This site carries articles exploring a range of topics of contemporary interest (including politics, art, culture and economics); authors have included Noam Chomsky and John Pilger.
