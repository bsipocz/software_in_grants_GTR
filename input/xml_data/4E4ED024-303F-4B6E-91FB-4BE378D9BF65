I will argue that the soldiers acted as political agents, negotiating their position in the context of a 'failed state', that is a state which has failed to secure political legitimatcy in the eyes of significant elements of the population and thereby generate a culture of citizenship. The soldiers created new and distinct communities, depending for their formation on the exigencies of the political and economic situation in Italy, and the requirements to secure the economic and political benefits that stemmed from successful military service. These communities were preserved beyond military service in the colonies established through Italy and elsewhere in the Caesarian and Triumviral periods. I argue that military service was the key means for elements of Roman society to secure necesary political and economic benefits and that military service and loyalty to comrades came to form the basis of a political community in default of the Roman state. Instead of understanding the soldiers as acting as agents of their political leaders or as class representatives, neither of which fit easily with the available evidence, the soldiers should be seen as an equivalent to insurgents, establishing an alternative power-structure outside conventional Roman politics, which relied heavily on violence to acquire political goals. Further, I will argue that the new Roman imperial state, established during the triumviral period, was an 'insurgent state'. Like other insurgencies, the insurgency did not seek revolutionary change, but to deploy political power, often expressed in conventional terms and with conventional leadership, to achieve unconventional political goals. Augustan political authority relied heavily on his ability to maintain control of the insurgency and to provide the insurgents with their political and economic requirements. This project thus attempts to explain the politics of the End of the Republic and the Foundation of Empire as resulting from a political and economic crisis in Roman Italy that allowed a successful insurgency to capture the Roman state.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This book concentrates on a central element in the contemporary understanding of political history. The rise and fall of the Roman Republic has been interpreted in many different ways since the fourteenth century and its reception has been a formative influence on our political culture. It has often been seen as a warning from history about the dangers of degeneracy, a parable about militarism, a worry about plutocracy and empire, or a story of inevitable corruption of political systems. As an issue in modern political culture, the End of the Republic has had considerable resonances in debates about Republicanism (seventeenth century onwards), constitutionalism (especially in the nineteenth century), and Caesarism (nineteenth and twentieth centuries), the legacies of which are felt into the twenty-first century through Liberalism and neo-Liberalism. These last ideologies have been particularly influential in the development of aid policy from the late twentieth century onwards, transforming the approaches of the IMF and World Bank, and driving attempts to state-build in Iraq and Afghanistan, among other places. This book (and it is not alone in this endeavour) attempts a paradigm shift through influencing one part of the ideological sub-structure of such Liberal approaches. As Ronald Syme in 1939 dramatised the rise of Augustus against the background of Mussolini's Rome, so this work will attempt to offer a reading of Roman history which gives full weight to economic and social conditions, and to the lesser actors in the political scheme, the soldiers. It will also attempt to broaden the perspective on state formation in antiquity (and by implication in modernity) by examining how subaltern groups are crucial to the process of state formation and how insurgencies can be incorporated into the political system, changing the perspective from a focus on the elite and the constitution to the question of how a state secures the legitimate interests of its citizens. The book addresses issues of contemporary political concern and as it is focused on a moment of general historical interest, seeks to appeal beyond the immediate academic discipline to researchers and thinkers in the political sphere. The dissemination of the work is through a new series with OUP (US), which seeks to bring the best of ancient historical writing to a general audience. It will thus be marketed and printed for an impact outside the immediate confined of the profession.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58013</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The work has been picked by a range of US websites and non-academic journals.

This period is one of revolution. The political traumas saw the transference of power from the senatorial elite to a large (patrimonial) political network which came to control the resources of empire and use those resource to bolster its political effectiveness. There was a change in both the structures of power in Roman political life and in the dominant group in Roman politics. Setting these events in a context of the social and economic history of the period, one can see that although this was no a conventional (class) revolution, it was a revolution in its violence and in its remaking of the social and political order.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Not sure</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>96620086-7FDE-441C-BBCB-4F30AB1FAFFB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6191637018.87395775b47aa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/caesar-augustus-the-emperor-who-flexed-romes-might/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A141C761-287B-452D-A593-5D339BF649EB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rome's Revolution: Death of the Republic &amp;amp; Birth of the Empire</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a752c528e25c3c9033ae56205bd5b02d"><gtr:id>a752c528e25c3c9033ae56205bd5b02d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Alston Richard</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199739769</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>542ad39a7be887.59569188</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D399CC2A-1CC5-4450-917A-C15BCBA1506E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ethnic Violence in Roman Alexandria: A Comparative Approach</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Violence et cruaut? en Egypte, depuis la Pr?histoire au Moyen ?ge</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d148f0d509a6216ea8baab733b9d962"><gtr:id>7d148f0d509a6216ea8baab733b9d962</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zouache A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>542ad788c84d38.06889658</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E751AB03-EE8D-40E1-9A01-9F4B5767D9E5</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Companion to Roman Imperialism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d77d62bd735f292da2234093d3e40397"><gtr:id>d77d62bd735f292da2234093d3e40397</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richard Alston</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9789004235939</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>542ad2df30fec4.35899274</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H03949X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
