Our University-wide public engagement unit, HW Engage has been very successful, winning multiple awards and prizes leading to widespread recognition both inside our university and across the sector. We have brought the passion we feel for our science and engineering to a very wide constituency and we know that this has had a positive effect on our university community. Now, we aim to fully and permanently embed this in our University's global culture and long-term strategic plan, by securing the full support of community stakeholders and the most senior leadership in our organisation.

We will adopt an evidence-led approach to influence the culture change in our university that we seek, and we aspire to help drive this cultural shift across the sector. We have had significant success in driving culture change in our own organisation through our Athena SWAN effort (this is a sector-wide Charter recognising advancement of gender equality - representation, progression and success for all). We deliberately adopted a consultative approach in this, to help establish our 'baseline' to understand a wide range of policies and positions. Here, we will do a similar thing: we will consult widely with our university colleagues to understand what they do, and why, in terms of public engagement and try to understand what they get out of this. We will also consult extensively with our public and other audiences to determine what they want from public engagement. We will then design a 'good practice checklist' based on this 2-way consultation, keeping our public involved throughout. We will build an Action Plan to follow specific, measurable, agreed, realistic and measurable initiatives for the duration of this project, with all actions designed to help mainstream and embed public engagement in our organisation's culture and shape future strategy. Activities such as 'Themed Years' will keep public engagement prominent in the agendas of colleagues and senior leadership, as well as keeping our science visible for our publics. Training programmes will enhance our colleagues' abilities to design and deliver effective public engagement that the public want, and management and leadership processes will recognise and reward this.

We have already overhauled our governance of public engagement at Heriot-Watt with a newly established strategic committee Chaired by our Deputy Principal and reporting directly to our most senior leaders on our University Executive; we are very keen to establish a direct line between our publics and our Principal. This committee will also include members of our public community to ensure continuous involvement in our decision making. After 12 months, we will run further public consultations (using focus groups and innovative methods, like walking interviews around our beautiful campus), to see how perceptions have changed against our baseline understanding and to help refine our Action Plan moving forwards.

At the end of this process we will share our findings across the sector. We will share our Good Practice Checklist ('EngageMe') with other public engagement professionals or interested parties, so that they can begin to assess their own baseline positions and construct their own Action Plans. Ultimately, we will create an online resource to track public engagement baseline positions and progress in becoming embedded across a progressively Engaging Britain, to provide a database of activity for the entire sector that can identify 'gaps' and future opportunities. Our own measure of the cultural changes we desire will be reflected in the inclusion of public engagement in our university 2018-25 strategy, better, fit-for-purpose engagement with the public, a continuing 2-way dialog with our communities, and an upskilled and enthusiastic cohort of appropriately recognised and rewarded engagement colleagues.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>What does a publicly engaged university of the future looks like?

Who might benefit?

We aim to provide excellent public engagement with research (PER) for a wide range of beneficiaries. A particular focus of our future PER Strategy will be to reach diverse audiences with PER that they want. To us, this means making extra efforts to access communities commonly overlooked by PER from Universities - disadvantaged groups, in alternative, non-science venues. We aim to embed PER in the culture and planning of our university. For PER to be embedded and valued, governance arrangements need to be in place, enabling and empowering researchers to share their research and establish mutually beneficial relationships with the public. The often ad-hoc nature of PER, and a common lack of clearly articulated strategy can lead to wasted effort, low quality engagement and engagement fatigue. Universities are constantly trying to evaluate the impact of their engagement, but there remains a real struggle to get meaningful and impactful results. 

The importance of PER within institutions is rising, but remains inconsistent across the UK. The Factors Affecting study states that PE still has an uncertain place within institutions and their structures, with a lack of high level commitment from senior management a key barrier. Where universities have taken steps in embedding PER, most initiatives are HEI-led, without consultation from the community about what works, what they want, and what they need. It is also known that some researchers turn to 'tried and tested' approaches engaging the public with research, rather than considering new ways to engage. But do the public like these tried and tested ways, or are the methods part of the reason that Universities struggle to engage with some audiences? How could we engage through social media, and do the public want us to? 

In answer to these questions, our strategy to influence culture change in this project will lead to a better informed public, who help co-design the PER they want. This in turn will engender a cohort of academics, researchers and professional services colleagues within our organisation who are enthusiastic, trained, recognised and rewarded. The next generation of colleagues will also be more able to articulate and explain their complex science to a broader audience - this is important for academia, society as a whole and also for the individuals wherever they are employed. We have also noticed a strong correlation between those who are involved with PER and good teaching practice in our university. Thus, we expect that enhanced PER training will also impact on our undergraduate and graduate students bodies. Finally, we are an impactful university, with strong industry ties. Although not an explicit part of our proposal, we fully expect our industry partners to benefit also - we will seek to involve them in training and dialog about the importance of engaging publics in their work and we have no doubt that this will be of 2-way benefit. 

How will they benefit?

Our proposal sets out a series of interlinked measures, actions and innovations to ensure a direct connection and dialog between our publics, partners and our most senior leadership, to our Principal. The public will benefit by interacting with our university body in a series of consultations. They will also benefit by being properly involved in shaping the PER they want. Our university and our colleagues will benefit in this dialog and in better understanding not only PER, but our purpose. Our industry partners will benefit too, by similarly learning from us and our communities how best to communicate their own purpose and place in society. The HEI sector will benefit from what we learn and from our plan to disseminate our findings. The HEI PER professional community, RCUK and other funding agencies will benefit from our planned 'Engaging Britain' tool that will map and identify future gaps and opportunities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45146</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R019711/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
