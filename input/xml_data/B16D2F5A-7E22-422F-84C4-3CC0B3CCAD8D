New business and consumer paradigms have recently emerged around eco-innovation, biotechnology, and photonics. At the same time, contemporary economic systems are characterized by high levels of internationalisation, chronic macro-economic instability and increasingly significant environmental challenges. A key question is whether regions that succeed in developing such emerging technological fields are more resilient to these trends. The project examines this question by building an evolutionary framework of regional resilience that facilitates understanding of how markets, technologies and territories co-evolve in a highly open and unstable economic environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A central research question is whether growth through ?related variety? is preferable for reasons of diversity and inter-sectoral innovation opportunities, than that based upon ?specialisation? in specific high-demand technologies. The structural properties of networks will also be studied in order to investigate how and where they might favour related variety, along with how some organizations and governance structures help develop appropriate knowledge connections.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This framework will be tested through quantitative assessments of technological relatedness at the European level in emerging technological fields, and qualitative assessment based on detailed biographies of the knowledge dynamics at work in selected territories.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296728</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Queen's School of Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Re-distributed manufacturing and the resilient city</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F67D587-9299-423C-A85D-FCBB02A40CB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs or outcomes as yet, although conference papers are in progress.

Our principal achievements are as follows:
(1) Significant new knowledge in the theory of regional innovation and development. The main aim of our project was to develop an evolutionary framework of regional resilience, allowing us to understand how markets, technologies and territories co-evolve in a highly open and unstable economic environment. We have achieved this through applying Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) thinking to Evolutionary Economic Geography (EEG) and developing an understanding of regions as complex systems characterised by co-evolutionary dynamics between firms, households, policy-makers and the external economic environment. In short, it has allowed us to develop and extend a relational, interactive perspective on how regional economies adapt and change.

In particular, we have developed new insights into two critical aspects of regional economic evolution. The first surrounds the role of knowledge recombination in regional innovation and the creation of new economic pathways. Specifically, we have developed a strengthened understanding of the importance of the cross-pollination of knowledge between firms and sectors. We have established that it is at these knowledge interfaces where new unforeseen innovations can emerge and existing regional development paths co-evolve and mutate to form new development trajectories. 

The second concerns the role, significance and nature of adaptive behaviour within regional economies in shaping their resilience to shocks and change. We have developed new theorising around adaptive agency in regional economies which has established that social relations between agents are key to how shocks play out and how adaptation occurs. Furthermore we have illuminated the interpretive, co-evolutionary and collective nature of this agency. In short, in complex regional systems, agents behave in a recursive manner, with firms, households and government adapting their behaviour in line with each other and the changing environment. 
 
(2) Significant new empirical knowledge created. We have developed new empirical insights into the co-evolutionary adaptations of economic agents within regional economies, as well as into new examples of knowledge recombination and the factors shaping them on the ground. This has particularly highlighted the importance of strong relational capacities amongst regional economic actors and the importance of having regional actors capable of acting as strong nodes in knowledge networks. 

(3) Important new research questions opened up. New questions have been identified concerning (a) the role of intermediaries and policy-making in the development of nodal targets for firms in order to maximise knowledge recombination and interactive innovation capabilities; and (b) the relationship between micro-level recombinant innovations and macro- (regional-scale) economic resilience.

(4) New research networks and collaborations developed. Our ORA collaboration has spawned at least two new research networks and collaborations - one on resilience which has subsequently secured ESPON funding for a study of regional economic resilience, and another on smart specialisation which is part of a wider FP7 project on this theme.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will be taken forward by economic geographers interested in understanding regional resilience and regional innovation. We have provided a theoretical framework which is less static and linear to explore the interactive effects and drivers of change within regional economies. This needs further empirical testing with, in particular, a need for (a) more analysis to relate the theoretical propositions developed to detailed analysis of the resilience of regional economies in performance (e.g. output) terms; (b) more cross-comparative empirical testing exploring where and why co-evolutionary adaptive responses to change are more proactive and transformative than simply reactive and responsive, including analysis of the critical networks at play and the factors which enable the development of positive collective mindsets. 

Our findings might be taken forward in the evolution of policy interventions in support of regional innovation. We have highlighted the importance of developing opportunities for the cross-fertilisation of knowledge across firms and sectors and the role and importance of institutional intermediaries and other key connectors in such networks.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>221CF127-DDB2-4CD8-805A-D41FB4A25270</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>557ee5516ccb55.95123035</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B69D8CC9-3856-4085-B312-D877FE7FB2C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Crisis response, choice and resilience: insights from complexity thinking</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/423a17f3babd3abfdbc26123fbe42297"><gtr:id>423a17f3babd3abfdbc26123fbe42297</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bristow G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>557e9c6a981256.37622867</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-360-25-0044</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I014667/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
