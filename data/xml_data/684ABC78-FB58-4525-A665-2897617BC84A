My doctoral research investigated and analysed the military archaeology in the late frontier, whilst my recent work has extended study into other aspects of frontier life, examining rural, urban, and 'barbarian' archaeology, and challenging the conventional chronological boundary of the Early Medieval period. My current work also focuses on the analysis of artefact assemblages, particularly noting where interpretations of specific classes of artefacts support or contradict hypotheses reached through the interpretation of structural sequences from archaeological excavation. \n\nMy investigation of the fourth-century frontier troops or limitanei of northern Britain concluded that the frontier army became increasingly localised over the course of the fourth century, with decreasing links to central imperial authorities. I explained this with reference to the sociological theory of occupational communities, providing a theoretical understanding for changes in the material culture. My doctoral research was limited to the military, analysing and reassessing the structural archaeology through excavation reports and archives from throughout the frontier. My most recent research (which will be finalised during my tenure of this fellowship) considers the changes in the material culture of rural, urban and 'barbarian' communities (to the extent that this latter can be distinguished from other frontier communities), and the links between these groups and the frontier soldiers. The project also includes a critical re-assessment of the contribution of historical sources, including the late-Roman military records known as the Notitia Dignitatum, to the study of the late frontier and the limitanei. This combines the insights of both archaeological and historical research to offer a synthetic treatment of the region.\n\nThe majority of this research has been conducted since the completion of my doctoral thesis, including data gathering and analysis. This fellowship will provide the time required to complete the preparation of a manuscript for the publication of the project monograph. I have agreed and signed a contract for the publication of this book with Routledge.\n\nThe project will also employ an archaeological illustrator to create interpretive reconstructions of the often ephemeral archaeology of the late fourth and fifth centuries. These illustrations are to be commissioned specifically to highlight the distinctive archaeological footprint of late frontier remains as well as to demonstrate alternative interpretations of structural remains. The illustrations will be employed as another analytical method, as well as to enhance the final publication for broad dissemination.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are a number of beneficiary audiences outside the academic community, with impact achieved through publication and dissemination of project results. \n\nAt the broadest level, the production of a project monograph with Routledge provides an excellent distribution to a global market. Therefore, there is excellent potential to promote the archaeological resource and research of Britain internationally. \n\nThe northern Roman frontier, monumentally represented by Hadrian's Wall, has broad popular appeal in printed and visual media, as well as a favoured tourist destination. As such, it is expected that the book will sell to a wider audience than the academic community. The publication of the project will contribute to continued public interest in the topic, particularly promoting consideration of the late Roman remains, which are generally given less attention in contrast to the archaeology of the second century. Related to this, the commissioning of original artwork to illustrate and interpret late Roman remains will further assist non-academics visualise a different period of British history. \n\nThe promotion of Hadrian's Wall and the northern frontier, as an academic interest and tourist destination, corresponds with the goals or numerous regional development agencies, for example Hadrian's Wall Heritage Ltd. Heritage tourism, and resources and outputs that promote this tourism, help to build and develop local economies and infrastructure, as well as 'adding value' to heritage resources. \n\nThe project also provides a focus and synthesises data from past excavations and on-going excavations in a fashion that is impossible for archaeological trusts and community projects to achieve, but which further contextualises their work. The dissemination of results from the numerous excavations that contribute to the End of Empire project promotes and develops networks throughout the study area. \n\nProject results may have an impact in terms of curation and management of Scheduled Ancient Monuments and World Heritage Sites. The publication will enhance site and monument interpretation, even in cases where research is well documented, for example Hadrian's Wall. The geographic and chronological parameters of the project will contextualise and relate various monuments throughout the region in new ways.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20838</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Reconstruction drawings of archaeological remains were commissioned to provide a visual rendering of 'flat' archaeological remains.

The on-line nature of the course means that 1000s of people were exposed to my research (presented by myself or a colleague) and had the opportunity to further comment or ask questions, to which I could then respond.

There were many comments from learners that they had not considered my particular area of research, late Roman and early post-Roman Hadrian's Wall, and they they found it stimulating. For many, this was very new and has challenged long-held ideas about the end of Roman Britain.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a3a6c1d3528.53051948</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/hadrians-wall</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hadrian's Wall and the End of Empire (YAS)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>45D1F942-389D-44DB-8F2F-364F455D553D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk/presentation given to the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, 21 January 2012.
