A variety of continuing engagements with diverse sets of users and audiences both in Indonesia and the UK is taking place. The purpose of these engagements is to describe, evaluate, and ultimately increase the effectiveness of Islamic interventions for poverty alleviation, enhancing the delivery of public services and the achievement of social well-being.

The impact agenda involves, as a first step, the co-production of research with end users, in particular, the three particular Islamic organisations I collaborated most closely with. This collaboration involves all stages of the research process from design and the selection of case studies to actual fieldwork and the dissemination of research findings. Co-production of research extends to taking an active part in policy forums, undertaking public intellectual and advisory work through participating in policy debates, and conducting outreach activities through print and electronic media as well as giving seminars and talks. Second, the impact agenda encompasses increasing research accessibility through writing expert reports for the sole benefit of research users. It also involves soliciting end users' feedback on early drafts of publications. I have sought in this way to embed end users in the analysis of data, making sure that that they commend on my ongoing writing-up of the research as well as that they are aware in greater detail of its conclusions. A set of outreach and dissemination activities targeting policy makers and other relevant constituencies, especially civil society organisations, educators, government policy makers, and other service providers have fostered effective and ongoing partnerships. Such partnerships have allowed for the exercise of multilevel and multi-stranded influence on matters of public awareness, perception and policy regarding Islamic interventions for poverty alleviation.
 
Outreach activities include a seminar presentation of preliminary research findings for the benefit of UK-based Islamic philanthropic organisations held at SOAS in January 2013. In July 2014, the Muslim Institute hosted on its blog a short article of mine that reported basic research findings to an audience comprising mainly of British Muslims (http://www.musliminstitute.org/blogs/front-featured/zakat-indonesian-story-konstantinos-retsikas). A version of the same article was disseminated to UK-based Islamic organisations active in poverty alleviation such as Islamic Relief and Muslim Aid, for their perusal. At the same time, my key findings are the subject matter of an interview with Faculti, the video of which has been uploaded on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqrwBZYErSM) as well as on my SOAS website. Due to the field of Islamic interventions for poverty alleviation being globally diverse and because Indonesian organisations are at the forefront of important innovations in programme design and delivery, the dissemination of my research findings to the UK public has contributed to increased awareness of such differences and the new directions such efforts have taken elsewhere. Fostering global awareness is significant for bringing about dialogue and improvements in services by policymakers and practitioners alike. 

In Indonesia, I engaged with the wider public through giving talks in public schools, Islamic boarding schools, and universities. I was invited to give talks to a total of seven education institutions in Surabaya and Jakarta. I also made myself available to the press for interviews. Interview materials have appeared in both print and electronic media, including Republika, Liputan Indonesia and Jawa Pos, all of which are national news providers. In parallel, I participated and contributed to discussions concerning the implications of the new Zakat Management Law (2011/23), often acting in an advisory capacity, and in concert with fellow Indonesian academics. The discussions, held both at public forums and private settings, led to the formation of a broad alliance of civil society bodies that in August 2012, filled for judicial review of the aforementioned law to the Constitutional Court. At the same time, I participated in discussions held by officials of the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs concerning the drafting of ministerial regulation as to the implementation of the new zakat law and the creation of a new bureaucratic structure for the management of zakat in the country. I also provided expert advice to the Muslim organisations I collocated most closely with and to the Indonesian government, in particular, the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Technology. Such expert advice took the form of submitting end-of-project research reports, written both in English and Indonesian. 

My long term engagement with Indonesian policy makers, practitioners and other experts on matters of Islamic poverty alleviation programmes, has contributed to the understanding of wider jurisprudential and policy issues, and involves the effort to change the terms of the debate. In this regard, I have advocated for alternative understandings of zakat which contrary to its conceptualisation as 'philanthropic giving', accord primacy to its legal status as 'right'. I have also questioned the usefulness of casting the 'enforcement' of zakat in exclusivist, binary terms such as those of state versus civil society. In their place, I have privileged practices of soliciting which are, in turn, unencumbered by such over-determined categories and projects. In addition, I have sought to clarify some of the effects Islamic micro-finance programs in Indonesia entail from the perspective of their 'poor beneficiaries', highlighting the negative consequences of the social creation of debt.
 
Overall, the project has emphasised the inter-disciplinary nature of the phenomena involved, extending the scale and reach of the research beyond anthropology, narrowly conceived. This opening of new intellectual frontiers involves tapping into a broader range of networks of expertise both in the UK and Indonesia. Accordingly I have sought to draw on knowledge from and contribute to Islamic studies, Islamic jurisprudence, Islamic banking and finance as well as development studies, political science and philosophy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DFB764FA-E88F-4944-963C-19031032D320</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>542cdedd0da7b7.04498899</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A total of three Islamic philanthropic organisations active in the cities of Surabaya and Jakarta in Java, Indonesia provided the focus of the study. To preserve their anonymity I have renamed them as Surabaya Peduli Ummat, Pondok Infak Mulia, and Dana Keadilan Indonesia. Fieldwork took place for a total of 12 months, between September 2011 and September 2012. The most significant findings are as follows:
State and civil society actors are actively engaged in outlining the basic contours of an Islamic economy in the country. 'Alms', especially zakat, feature prominently in such project along with the prohibition of interest (riba). However, there are intense debates within state institutions and civil society bodies about the form and content of such future Islamic economy as different actors have diverse interests and approach the topic from very different perspectives. In particular, civil society bodies are openly contesting the authority of the state to both regulate and manage zakat across the country and they feel threatened by the introduction of new legislation, especially the Zakat Management Law 23/2011. 
Civil bodies managing zakat emerged in Indonesia in the mid- and late-1990s and came to full fruition during the 'reformation' period that begun in 1998 with the end of the New Order regime. Within a short period and despite an acute economic crisis, several organisations grew large, expanded their operations across the space of the nation and went to set up branches abroad. This remarkable growth is intimately related to the expansion of the middle-class in Indonesia and the rising religious consciousness among the ranks of professionals, entrepreneurs and civil servants in large urban centers. It goes without saying that the latter constitute the majority of donors the said civil bodies draw their funds from, principally zakat, sedekah, infak and wakaf. In addition, Islamic philanthropic organisation work together with commercial companies, including multinational ones, in managing corporate social responsibility projects. 
The field of Islamic micro-finance has received due attention by civil bodies involved in zakat management in Indonesia. A variety of contractual and institutional innovations for poverty alleviation are presently being tried out in rural and urban settings. Islamic scholars are actively engaged in devising and authorizing such innovations through new jurisprudential reasoning regarding credit and debt. At the same time, the recipients of such assistance, in their majority the poor and the destitute (fakir-miskin) of the relevant Quranic injunction, are been refashioned by means of training provided by philanthropic organisations. Such training exposes the poor to new regimes of value and aims to inculcate new sets of routines and habits. 
The field of Islamic micro-finance is supported by other interventions in the field of poverty alleviation. As such, civil bodies involved in zakat management are also active in the provision of education, health, Islamic propagation (dakwah) and disaster relief. Some are also engaged in advocacy especially with regards to Indonesian workers abroad and the promotion of good governance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The question of creating a viable Islamic economy for the purpose of alleviating poverty and generating new sources of prosperity has been raised not only across the Islamic world but also in centers of conventional banking and finance such as the City of London. My research engages with this question not from the usual perspective of non-interest based banking but primarily from the perspective of zakat, the obligatory dues well-off Muslims are required to pay. 
My research provides a qualitative, ethnography-based account of the ways in which zakat has recently been transformed from a traditional ritual practice into a modern tool for achieving socio-economic justice in Indonesia. In particular, my research charts the legal, institutional, social and technical arrangements that have been put in place for the realisation of such goal. In this regard it would be of immediate interest and should have direct impact to those institutions and groups, both national and international, both Islamic and non-Islamic, with a stake in promoting and safeguarding human welfare broadly conceived. 
The immediate 'user' community consists of both governmental and non-governmental organisations active in the field of community empowerment and poverty alleviation, other social service providers including private ones, and banks, inclusive of the Islamic Development Bank and the World Bank. Moreover it would be of interest to national bodies such as the UK Department for Business, the Department for International Development, and the Foreign Office. The likely impact of the research is related to raising awareness of processes currently underway in such a manner that makes possible the formulation of appropriate policy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4E195FC9-B4C6-4006-90C8-222612F006C7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>542cde20cf0575.74558267</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-2639</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/H040811/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>32A0976A-B577-4829-A940-9AB6B148F977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area &amp; Development Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
