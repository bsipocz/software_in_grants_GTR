The student will provide mechanistic and functional insights into the consequences of expressing the APDS mutation, E 1 020K, in mouse T cells (using CD4-Cre). Should the conditional allele not behave as expected, a strain with a germ line point mutation will also be generated. This is unlikely to lead to embryonic mortality as PI3K6 is not essential for survival.
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from APDS patients produce elevated levels of PIP3 (the lipid product produced by PI3K) and that this can be suppressed by PI3Kdeita inhibitors. Surprisingly, T cells from the patients produce less cytokines and tend to die rather than proliferate after stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. This is consistent with the observation that the
patients are Iymphopenic and immunodeficient. Therefore, initially, the student will use a battery of tests available in the lab to enumerate the various T cell subsets in the mouse and determine their phenotype e.g. by looking at activation markers such as CD44 and CD62L, both of which are affected by PI3K activity.
Next, the student will stimulate purified T cells in presence or absence of p11 06-selective tool inhibitors and measure PI P3 levels using a recently developed mass spectroscopy based assay. In parallel, the student will resolve proteins by gel electrophoresis and monitor cell signalling events, such as the phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308. These assays are well established in the lab. The student will stimulate purified T cells and anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and measure proliferation, cytokine production and monitor survival of the T cells. It will be important to determine if these T cells also undergo high levels of apoptosis as was observed with patient T cells. Infection studies will also be carried out on these mice. PI3K tool inhibitors will be provided by GSK, but will exclude the use of clinical compounds.
The student will spend at least 6 months at GSK, and carry out a gene array and/or proteomic analysis, comparing WT, p11060910A and p1106E1020K T cells. This will be used to assess how inhibition or hyper activation of PI3K6 affects signalling and gene expression networks in T cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95177</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/B/000M0798</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
