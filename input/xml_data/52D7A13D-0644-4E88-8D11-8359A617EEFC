For instance, how do we choose among different goods at the supermarket or how do we decide which mobile phone to purchase? How do we weigh the pros and cons of the various options to make our choices as rewarding as possible? How do we make use of our prior experience with the various alternatives to help us make better choices and obtain bigger rewards in the future? How do we learn, through trial and error, to update our future predictions in order to adapt and keep up with the competitive and ever-changing world around us? Importantly, we do not want to merely measure how people behave in some of these scenarios but we would also like to understand how the human brain processes the relevant information and how the outcome of that process ultimately cause one to express or externalize (i.e., by acting out) their preferred choice.

In recent years, modern neuroimaging methods have made it possible for researchers to &amp;quot;take a peak&amp;quot; into the human brain. Human electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method whereby electrodes placed on the surface of the scalp measure the brain's electrical activity. This technique provides precise information on when the brain processes information in time but cannot provide a clear picture of where in the brain this information is coming from. In contrast, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures (non-invasively in an MRI scanner) changes in the local blood flow in the brain as we process information. This in turn allows one to identify where in the brain this processing takes place but at the expense of poor precision in terms of when processing occurs in time. It is therefore easy to see that if these techniques were applied simultaneously, they could clearly compliment each other and help provide answers as to both when and where the brain processes information. 

To perform concurrent EEG and fMRI experiments, however, one needs to overcome a series of technical challenges and devise an analysis methodology that will integrate the two datasets in a manner that circumvents the disparate space and time scales on which they are acquired. In collaboration between the Schools of Psychology and Physics at the University of Nottingham as well as our international partners (i.e., Department of Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University in New York), we have started to use some cutting-edge technology and analysis tools to overcome these challenges and make these simultaneous measurements possible. In this project we will recruit volunteers who will be asked to perform simple value and preference judgments while we simultaneously record EEG and fMRI data from them. We will then use the methodology we have recently devised to look at the data in an attempt to provide answers to the questions outlined above. 

Crucially, understanding which brain areas are involved in value judgments, how they interact with one another and at which times can potentially lead to practical applications. For instance knowing how to tab into and monitor the various brain processes involved in value-based decision making can have applications in domains as diverse as economic and public policy analysis (e.g., when deciding on savings strategies and health behaviours) and marketing (e.g., when optimizing advertisement strategies and product design). In addition, improved understanding of the neurobiology of decision-making can potentially have applications in identifying prognostic indicators of normal and abnormal ageing or in defining precursors of disorders known to compromise ones decision-making faculties (e.g., autism, personality disorders, etc).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In recent years the study of the neurobiological and computational basis of value-based decision making has received considerable attention and it provided the foundation upon which the field of neuroeconomics was built. Despite recent progress in understanding the neural correlates of value-based decisions, key questions pertaining to how value is computed at a mechanistic level remain. Specifically, it is unclear whether sensory regions are modulated by the value (or probabilistic evidence) conferred by different decision alternatives and how and where this information is combined to generate the value signal needed to make a decision. Another essential element of valuation pertains to how we process rewards to update future value expectations. Accurate reward representations associated with potential choices are critical for adaptive decision making. These representations can be acquired with reinforcement learning mechanisms, which use the prediction error (PE), the difference between expected and actual rewards, as a learning signal to update expectations. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the network associated with PE processing and the mechanisms by which PE valence and magnitude are used to update expectations and guide future choices remain inconclusive. In this project we will use state-of-the art neuroimaging to couple single-trial analysis of the EEG with simultaneously acquired fMRI to infer, with both high temporal and high spatial resolution information, the cascade of constituent cortical processes involved in value judgments and reward processing in humans. Our working hypothesis is that trial-to-trial variability in electrophysiologicaly-derived measures has information content that is meaningful in representing the dynamics of latent brain states that are unobservable via stimulus or behaviourally derived measures, which in conjunction with fMRI can be used to expose the cortical networks involved in value-based decision making.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential impact of the developments supported by this application could address several of BBSRC's new strategic priorities (e.g. economic, social and public policy impact, cognitive ageing, systems approach to biological research). 

Economic, social and public policy impact: In our everyday lives we constantly engage in value and preference judgments to make choices that are more likely to lead to desirable outcomes. Knowing how to tab into and monitor the various brain processes involved in value-based decision making can have applications in domains as diverse as economic and public policy analysis (e.g. to inform decisions on health behaviours and savings strategies) and marketing (e.g. to help optimize advertisement strategies and product design). 

Imagine for instance having to make a choice between a high-calorie strawberry smoothie and a healthy alternative such as a fruit salad. Obesity is a growing problem in the western world and can have direct and severe consequences on people's health as well as indirect costs on a nation's health care system. A more thorough characterization of the cortical networks underlying preference judgments and reinforcement-guided decision making can potentially lead to ways of enhancing the value of less-preferred choices (in this example low-caloric foods), possibly through feedback protocols that make use of incentive motivation to reinforce and promote optimum (here healthier) behaviour.

Another translational aspect of this work relates to the newly developed field of neuromarketing. For example, how does one develop an effective and influential advertisement campaign (e.g. to promote a new product or service and raise public awareness for key health and socioeconomic issues such the one outlined above)? Traditional marketing techniques rely heavily on market research through cumbersome approaches (e.g. through surveys and questionnaires) that can suffer experimenter biases and that are often hard to quantify. In contrast, neural signatures of value can provide a true quantitative measure of internal preference and as such can be used to triage through various advertisement pieces and product designs. 

Cognitive ageing and disorders: In normal and abnormal cognitive ageing even simple decision making is effected, as evidenced by changes in behavioural measures such as accuracy and response time. A number of disorders known to compromise ones decision-making faculties (e.g. autism, personality disorders) can also lead to similar behavioural changes. The imaging tools and methods proposed here could potentially be used to characterize the neural changes that are causal to these behavioural changes. As such this work can lead to the development of new methods for identifying diagnostic and prognostic indicators of cognitive deficits, as well as more directed behavioural and pharmacological treatments.

Systems approaches to biological research: This work also addresses BBSRC's priority on &amp;quot;exploiting new ways of working&amp;quot;. It is practically axiomatic that new tools, particularly in neuroimaging, lead to new observations and more fundamental understanding of the processes under observation. For decision making some of the neural processes underlying it can only be observed via trial-to-trial electrophysiological variability. All fMRI studies of decision making to date, more-or-less, look at mean changes and do not consider trial-to-trial changes (other than those that can be measured behaviourally). Here, we will develop a new methodology that exploits trial-to-trial changes in EEG (via multivariate analysis techniques) to drive the analysis of simultaneously acquired fMRI data in order to identify latent brain states associated with value-based decisions. Here, this new approach will be used to address issues in some of BBSRC's priority areas (as outlined above) but at the same time has the potential to become a powerful new tool in cognitive neuroscience in general</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>260141</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>PI interview with Davey Anderson and Gary McNair from Trigger Productions on &amp;quot;How To Choose?&amp;quot;.

A clinically meaningful predictor of treatment response should ideally be treatment-specific and predict differential outcome to either medications or psychotherapy. 

We have been able to use the framework we have developed to study reward learning in the human brain to predict the likelihood of treatment response in MDD (more reliably that standard behavioural assessments currently obtained in the clinic). New findings indicate that this brain-informed approach has the potential to become a clinically viable predictors of response to CBT and antidepressant treatment for MDD in order to inform the development of a stratified medicine approach to psychiatric clinical practice. More specifically, to discriminate response to computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in a sample of 37 unmedicated depressed subjects we modelled the online appraisal of feedback information during a probabilistic learning task employing a dynamic learning rate. First, using computational modelling we showed between-group differences in the learning style. Second, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we leverage the pre-treatment neural encoding of the dynamic learning rate in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and show between-group differences in BOLD activity following negative probabilistic feedback. Our findings provide novel and important insights into the putative cognitive mechanisms underpinning response to cCBT and lend support to the feasibility and validity of neurocomputational approaches to treatment prediction research in psychiatry.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DEF70ACF-111C-40D7-BE47-55F92F78C58C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a0e7436b20.85490480</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Imagine picking wild berries in a forest when suddenly a swarm of bees flies out from behind a bush. In a split second, your motor system has already reacted to flee the swarm. This automatic response constitutes a powerful survival mechanism that allows efficient behaviour switching to run away from a threat. In turn, a separate and more deliberate process of learning to avoid similar situations will also occur, rendering future berry picking attempts less appealing. This example highlights that avoiding repeated mistakes and learning to reinforce rewarding decisions is critical for human survival and adaptive actions. Yet, the neural underpinnings of the value systems that encode different decision outcomes remain elusive. Here, coupling single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneously acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An EEG machine records brain activity with high temporal precision (&amp;quot;when&amp;quot; things are happening in the brain) while functional MRI provides information on the location of this activity (&amp;quot;where&amp;quot; things are happening in the brain). To date, &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;where&amp;quot; questions have largely been studied separately, using each technique in isolation.

Here, by combining the two techniques we uncovered the spatiotemporal dynamics of two separate but interacting value systems encoding decision-outcomes. Consistent with a role in regulating alertness and switching behaviours, an early system is activated only by negative outcomes and engages arousal-related and motor-preparatory brain structures. Consistent with a role in motivational learning and updating value representations associated with future choices, a later system differentially suppresses or activates regions of the human reward network in response to negative and positive outcomes, respectively. Following negative outcomes, the early system interacts and down-regulates the late system, through a thalamic interaction with the ventral striatum. Critically, the strength of this coupling predicts participants' switching behaviour and avoidance learning, directly implicating the thalamostriatal pathway in reward-based learning.

Another main aim of this work was to use the same state-of-the-art neuroimaging approach (simultaneous EEG-fMRI) to characterise the spatiotemporal dynamics of the decision making process itself during preference- and value-based decision making. Current computational work suggests that value and preference-based decisions involve an integrative mechanism in which subjective value information supporting different decision alternatives accumulates over time to an internal decision boundary. However, the neurobiological validity of this proposition remains unclear. In this work we were able to capture this process of evidence accumulation as it unfolded in time using our EEG signals. We subsequently exploited these signals and used them as predictors for the fMRI data that were recorder simultaneously and uncovered a, previously overlooked, region of the posteriomedial prefrontal cortex that appears to be responsible for implementing the temporal integration of value information in order to drive the decision. Consistent with integrating the evidence for the decision, this region also exhibited task-dependent coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum, brain areas known to encode the subjective value of the decision alternatives. These results further endorse the proposition of an evidence accumulation process during value-based decisions in humans and implicate the posterior-medial frontal cortex in this process. Despite a long literature implicating certain regions of the prefrontal and ventromedial parietal cortex in encoding the subjective value assigned to different choices, no previous study has been able to reliably identify the brain centre responsible for processing this information to drive the decision.

Crucially, we also confirmed that the main findings of this work would have been missed using stand-alone EEG or fMRI measurements. We clearly demonstrated that it is the combination of the two brain imaging modalities that enabled the developments described above. This finding is important as it suggests that the data acquisition and analysis methodology we developed in this work can become a power new tool in cognitive neuroscience.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our general research approach (simultaneous EEG-fMRI and corresponding analysis methods) as well as our scientific findings open up new avenues for the investigation of the neural systems underlying value- and reward-based decision making in humans. Crucially, our findings have the potential to further our understanding of how everyday responses to rewarding or stressful events can affect our capacity to make optimal decisions, as well as facilitate the study of how mental disorders - such as chronic stress, obsessive-compulsive-disorder, post-traumatic disorder and depression - affect learning and strategic planning. Correspondingly, our work can lead to the development of new methods for identifying diagnostic and prognostic indicators of cognitive deficits in disease, as well as more directed behavioural and pharmacological treatments. It is also likely that our results can have significant impact on how artificial neural networks are trained and adapted to learn to deal with an ever-increasing number of online &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E770A4A7-9078-451A-AAE8-55830FF55EC7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d996046c1324.99402817</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Summer School on Brain Imaging</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>57939B37-F27B-43AC-A576-8556CC2FABFE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have been developing an international summer school on advanced brain imaging methods that will run on a yearly basis at the Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging at the University Glasgow starting in 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d99088cd4972.36579777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Combined measurements of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 24 healthy participants performing two different tasks designed to probe the neural correlates of value-based decision making and the role of learning during reward-based decisions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B8CC91D0-2B42-4588-907D-B58AE93DA705</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Combined EEG and fMRI measurements offer an opportunity to gain important new insights into human brain function that cannot be obtained using either modality alone (e.g. revealing latent brain states).
