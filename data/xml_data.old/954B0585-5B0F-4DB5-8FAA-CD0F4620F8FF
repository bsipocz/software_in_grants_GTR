This provision takes the form of a training programme coordinated by the Indigenous Languages Division (ILD) of the Ministry of Culture. Graduates from the programme (speakers of some of Peru's 47 indigenous languages) become members of the National Register of Translators and Interpreters in Indigenous Languages (Howard, de Pedro Ricoy and Andrade Ciudad, forthcoming 2017) and are able to work as accredited professionals in this area. 

These State-level developments are framed by the 2011 Languages Act, which guarantees the right of indigenous peoples to translation and interpreting in Prior Consultation processes and access to public services (e.g. justice and health). The Peruvian domestic legislation arises from the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169), whose Article 30 enshrines the right of indigenous peoples to have Governments &amp;quot;adopt measures (...) to make known to [the peoples] their rights and duties, especially in regard to labour, economic opportunities, education and health matters, social welfare and their rights deriving from this Convention. [...] If necessary, this shall be done by means of written translations and through the use of mass communications in the languages of these peoples.&amp;quot; 

An unexpected finding that emerged from our research and to which our Research Partner, the NGO Servicios Educativos Rurales (SER), drew our attention in the process, is that many of the indigenous women with whom they work, who have not followed the ILD training and are not, therefore, registered professionals, undertake language-brokering activities to serve the communication needs of fellow women in their communities. It is often the case that indigenous women, by contrast with men, are less bilingual and may lack the working understanding of Spanish needed in order to engage with outside agents (eg. health, environmental, and development workers).

The women in question (referred to by SER as &amp;quot;social interpreters&amp;quot;) have been developing these activities with SER's support, around two key areas:

- The Commission to record the testimonies of women subjected to forcible sterilisation between 1996 and 2000, an issue officially recognised as being of national concern in 2015. Nearly 315,000 women, most of them indigenous, were subjected to sterilisation, of which only 10% gave their consent, according to the Latin American and Caribbean Commission for the Rights of Women (CLADEM). As full redress is being sought for the affected women, the social interpreters are collaborating with the Ministries of Culture and of Justice and Human Rights, in order to create a register of the cases.

- The political drive for recognition of indigenous women in rural areas as full members of their communities, entitling them to vote in community assemblies on decisions regarding communal land and resources. This also relates to policy initiatives to amend the 1982 Rural Communities Act, coordinated with ONAMIAP (Peruvian National Organisation of Indigenous Andean and Amazonian Women). The social translators play a key role in these processes, by raising awareness among women and providing relevant training for them.

Our project will throw a spotlight on the role of the social interpreters in the above two areas, using a range of methods and outputs designed to draw public attention to, and provide support for, their activities. Their grassroots work has not enjoyed the same levels of visibility or recognition as the top-down provision established by the Peruvian State, yet they work to protect the human rights of indigenous women in tangible ways. Their activity can be an exemplar for future developments concerning women's rights in Peru and the Latin American region.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will create pathways to impact, public engagement and knowledge exchange in relation to the human rights of indigenous women in contemporary Peru. It is intended to benefit the indigenous women who act as social interpreters in the Andean region. They have taken action to support indigenous women's participation in governance and formal decision-making processes in their communities, and are also assisting women who were forcibly sterilised (1996-2000) as part of a government-sponsored programme, to give their testimonies and seek redress.
Two visual arts events, an itinerant exhibition and a short multilingual theatre play, will be co-created with the Partner and the social interpreters who provide linguistic and cultural mediation for indigenous women. The goal of these events is twofold: to visibilise the role of the social interpreters as advocates of women's rights, and to engage sectors of civil society and institutions who are not aware of this role. Increased awareness should have an impact on public perceptions about indigenous women and empower the social interpreters to play an active role in relevant State decision-making processes. 
An open-access digital repository of audiovisual materials about the role of the female indigenous social interpreters will be launched and publicised. It will provide first-hand, novel data that will be of interest to researchers and will also give the general public insights into a social reality with which they are not necessarily acquainted. The interpreters and other relevant actors will be able to expand the data base on an ongoing basis through the curators (the Partner and the PUCP). This will have an impact on generating knowledge in both specialised and lay contexts.
Knowledge exchange will take place during a forum discussion and a series of meetings between the Partner and the social interpreters, on the one hand, and the researchers, on the other. This will ensure that the latter achieve a better understanding of how the intercultural dialogue with the State is managed, which will enable them to provide input that is of benefit to the former. The PI (who has trained interpreters for over 18 years) will plan and oversee the production of a collection of video-recorded training materials, based on the challenges that the interpreters face and their personal experiences, as legacy for future female indigenous interpreters. The Co-I and the International Co-I will collaborate by drawing on their extensive linguistic and sociolinguistic knowledge of intercultural contexts in the Andean region.
These activities and outputs are intended to provide a platform on which the social interpreters and the Partner can build sustainably. After the inaugural show, the artefacts used in the exhibition will be devolved to the Partner, so that they can be displayed in multiple locations during and after the project. The theatre play will be video-recorded to ensure wide dissemination, especially in remote areas. The repository will remain accessible and it is envisaged that it will grow over time. The set of training materials should enhance the future provision of social interpreting, in that it will be a useful toolkit for women who are not yet experienced interpreters. Finally, there is potential for the initiatives described here to be transferred to other contexts in the Latin-American region, for the consideration of governmental and non-governmental organisations that support the human rights of indigenous women and their access to services.
To conclude: this impact, public engagement and knowledge exchange programme is grounded in the needs and demands of grassroots movements, most of whose members are Quechua and Aymara speakers, working towards a more equal and peaceful society. Furthermore, it is underpinned by the principle that it should enable the social actors involved to take it forward by themselves after the completion of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82841</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R004579/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E66DC80-F20F-4AC2-915A-AF46F5C6ED14</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interpreting &amp; Translation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE8091C9-38A1-47B0-ACDE-331864A8A453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law, Democracy and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D5E20EB-F470-4A70-9B72-5D68D7AFB1EB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Nat Resources, Env &amp; Rural Dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2606D7FE-3D1B-4A58-B497-DB1B211EFF02</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociolinguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
