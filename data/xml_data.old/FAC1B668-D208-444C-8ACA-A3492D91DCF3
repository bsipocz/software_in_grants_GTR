Gathering such evidence involves verification, the process of demonstrating that the implementation of a system meets the requirements laid down in its specification. Much work has been done to develop tools and methods for verification of microelectronic designs and software.

When we try to verify an autonomous, intelligent system (AIS), with existing methods, two problems arise: 

First, traditional verification techniques rely on a specification that fully defines the functional behaviour of the system to be verified. But, we want to use an intelligent system - one that can adapt to circumstances, deciding what to do without being told exactly how - precisely so we can avoid having to specify a response for every possible scenario. There are usually far too many possible scenarios for this to be practical. Instead, we need flexible specifications expressed in terms of acceptable and required behaviour with associated precise limits for critical properties complemented by more vague indications of desired actions.

Second, the control software to achieve dynamic adaptation is very complex, using iterative optimization algorithms to combine discrete and continuous decision-making. Although there has been much research on how to design these algorithms, their verification is still an open research question.

The RIVERAS project aims to tackle both of these problems. 

First, we will develop a way of verifying a system with a flexible specification. This will require a formal way to write a specification, using a modelling language that can capture these flexible requirements. Then, fuzzy concepts will be used to analyse how well we meet the specification. Fuzzy concepts are graded and properties or statements involving them are true (or false) to some degree. This means that specifications may only be partialy satisfied which introduces new challenges when verifying them.

Second, we will also develop ways of verifying control software that uses optimization, which is a general approach for making decisions. Given a cost model and a set of constraints that define permitted limits, an optimizer finds the best set of decisions to maximize or minimize the cost while staying within permitted limits. Most planning problems for intelligent systems can be expressed in the form of optimization and research on control theory proves properties that help us understand how well it should work. We will use the properties established with control theory as a specification to demonstrate that the optimizer software does what it should. Moreover, we will integrate these properties into the software. This allows us to detect, contain and correct failures should they occur. 

Finally, we will integrate all these developments into an innovative &amp;quot;Design for Verification&amp;quot; (DFV) method. Engineers who use our DFV methods when specifying and designing an intelligent system, and when producing its optimization-based control software, will immediately be able to use our verification methods to determine if they have done it right. This will be far easier and a lot more efficient than designing it first, without thinking about verification, and then figuring out how to verify afterwards.

To help refine our methods and to evaluate them afterwards, RIVERAS will try them out on real robots. For example, we will design an intelligent exploration system for a Mars rover, implement it on a robot on Earth, and produce all the verification evidence to demonstrate it works as intended.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The economic impact of this work comes from the UKs ability to exploit its results as it becomes a world leader in intelligent systems. The potential for this impact is highlighted by the industrial support for the Call for Proposals. The capacity to verify the behaviour of real-time decision making systems is a prerequisite for their use in many safety-critical applications. This certainly includes the four scenarios described in the Call for Proposals, in which the need for greater autonomy and flexibility must be balanced with strict requirements for safe operation. Indeed the importance of verification is recognized by EPSRC who have identified it as an area for growth in their recent Shaping Capability Policy. The verification capability developed by RIVERAS will boost the prospect for intelligent systems in safety critical market sectors. It also enables the mass production of the next generation of intelligent consumer gadgets and toys, unlocking huge market potential.

The social impact of this research comes from enabling the deployment of more autonomous intelligent systems in a wider range of missions and environments. This will reduce risk to humans operating in hazardous environments while extending capabilities in those environments in which it is impractical or too costly to deploy manned or human operated systems. It will also enable new opportunities such as human assistive robots, public safety applications, and the enormous potential of space exploration. We will engage with the industrial partners throughout the project and especially with regards to the case studies. In particular, knowledge exchange will take the form of input from partners regarding the selection of relevant test problems, and output to partners of research results. A contribution in kind has been requested for time and expertise from the industrial partners as well as travel funds for the necessary visits. We are also requesting access to simulation and experimental facilities where appropriate. Indeed, this goal of integrating our techniques with an industrial partner's platform, such as a robotic rover, provides avenues for direct industrial exploitation of the work. Overall the team has a strong track record in industrial engagement. In particular, Dr Eder's close collaboration with the local and international microelectronics design industry is evidenced in numerous collaborative projects.

A further societal impact is improved public perception of autonomous systems, which are often portrayed negatively in the public arena using terms like &amp;quot;Killer Drone&amp;quot;. In reality, however, human-robot interaction offers great promise, such as assisted independent living, more economic services and improved public safety, e.g. when used by fire and rescue services. Close interaction with these robots will necessitate a degree of compatibility with us to ensure safety and dependability, requiring negative perceptions to be challenged. This challenge strays beyond engineering and includes ethical, legal and societal questions. Should intelligent systems imitate human behaviour? Who is liable when the system makes a mistake? Our proposal can contribute to this important debate. We aim to embed the same rigorous safety verification culture in autonomous systems as is found in aviation, whose safety is held in high regard by the public. This impact will be facilitated by Bristol's STAARS (Safe and Trustworthy Autonomous Assistive Robots) initiative, bringing together researchers from law, psychology and robotics with members of the RIVERAS team. 

The fields of autonomous systems and robotics need a new generation of researchers who possess specialist knowledge and expertise combined with an understanding of how this expertise fits within the broader endeavour of designing and building intelligent systems. The two researchers employed on the project will develop a set of sought-after skills highly valued by both industry and academia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>817019</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Liverpool</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Computer Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>Network on the Verification and Validation of Autonomous Systems</gtr:description><gtr:id>E37481FA-85FF-45AA-A1CE-0E1F3EBE8AE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>community building to date</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9da6c04ba57.79469227-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Leading network activities, organising networking events, community building, dissemination, research roadmap shaping, etc</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Presentations on the state of the art of test-based verification techniques, participation and contribution to networking events, organisation of a workshop.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited presentation at the National Microelectronics Institute's event on Accelerating Verification - faster, smarter</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>68DE247D-A543-47D2-84C7-B713C87F9E1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>presentation sparked invitations for more detailed discussions, knowledge transfer and collaborations

Contribution of the session entitled &amp;quot;Practical Techniques for Verification and Validation of Robots&amp;quot;
Abstract
This session is focused on practical techniques for the verification and validation of autonomous systems from specification via design to the code level. Because no single technique is adequate to cover a whole system in practice, a variety of verification techniques, including formal methods, such as model checking and theorem proving, and state-of-the-art simulation-based methods, will be presented from first principles and brought into the context of robotics. How these techniques can be applied will be illustrated using real-world examples. We will start with the verification of control system designs with respect to high-level requirements, such as stability, using an assertion-based approach that combines simulation-based verification with automatic theorem proving. We will then focus on using model-based techniques to enhance test generation in the context of coverage-driven verification applied to code used in robots that directly interact with humans. The session will finish with the proposal to design autonomous systems &amp;quot;for verification&amp;quot;; this requires a paradigm shift towards more systematic design practices.

The research presented in this session is based on collaborations within the EPSRC funded projects &amp;quot;Robust Integrated Verification of Autonomous Systems&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Trustworthy Robotic Assistants&amp;quot;. This session will be supplemented with hands-on demonstrations presented by Dejanira Araiza Illan.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9df7de1f721.65580578</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/circus/RoboCalc-event/courses/practical-techniques-for-verification-and-validation-of-robots/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Verification and Control of Cyber-physical Systems: Theory and Applications</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>80AB1AB4-D5B5-4728-BD14-5A3AE74B2226</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave an invited talk on &amp;quot;Intelligent test generation for advanced coverage-driven verification of robotic code&amp;quot; at this workshop. The event highlighted recent advances and developments in verification in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), motivated by emerging applications involving autonomous systems such as automated vehicles and robotic systems. The talks focused on verification and control of complex CPS's, with the aim to facilitate an in depth understanding of the challenges posed by their hybrid dynamics, interconnected and distributed nature, the presence of exogenous and/or endogenous uncertainty affecting their evolution, their safety and operational critical nature, and with a wide coverage of possible solution methodologies. The goal of the workshop was to expose attendees to cutting edge research in the field, with an eye on both theory and applications, and to encourage the development of new results and the investigation of several important issues in the future of complex CPSs design, promoting novel collaborations. To this purpose, outstanding researchers from leading industries and universities worldwide were brought together by the organizers to offer their vistas on the field.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c809fb16e621.34341850</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://cdc2016.ieeecss.org/workshops.php#w06</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invitation to contribute to an Expert Panel on The Advancement of Medical Devices: Robots in Healthcare held at the European Parliament in Brussels</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CAD670E8-C3B0-4DE9-8B65-015E39FBB2A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>my presentation sparked questions and stimulated a discussion on safety of robots and the need to design for safety

We have shown how to specify these properties, starting from control theory requirements and refining these into formal logic properties expressed as assertions (logic expressions) that can monitor the control system's behaviour during simulation-based testing. The same properties can also be translated into proof goals for formal verification with theorem provers. 

Verification of robotic code: Robot software developers usually point towards the cost of manual verification or lack of automated tools that would handle their code. We have demonstrated that the choice of programming language is essential both for finding bugs in the code and for proving their absence. Our re-implementation of three robot navigation algorithms in SPARK revealed bugs that for years have not been detected in their original code in C/C++. For one of the implementations we demonstrated that it is free from run-time errors. Our code and results are available online to encourage uptake by the robot software developers community.

Specification: Autonomous intelligent systems (AIS) must cope with complex and changing environments whilst operating under physical constraints dictated by their hardware and control software. We consider vaguely defined requirements (VRs) as well as probabilistic requirements (PRs), and how they can be combined. Analysis using formal methods, e.g. model checking, is available to determine how PRs are satisfied. VRs can be successfully modeled using fuzzy logic. We propose the complementary uses of both types of analysis to evaluate AIS designs, in particular when requirements may conflict with each other. We specify levels of requirements satisfaction, modeled with probabilistic model checking tools and fuzzy logic formalization techniques. This description identifies a partial ordering of AIS designs, which provides a means to systematically explore the design space, i.e. ranking and discriminating between possible choices at design time. It allows to investigate the trade-offs between conflicting VR and PR satisfaction levels. We have demonstrated the potential of this approach using an autonomous robot case study based on a home care scenario. The ranking and comparison of the opposed VRs and PRs helps identify the &amp;quot;optimal&amp;quot; designs, i.e. those with the best trade-offs in terms of requirement satisfaction.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Industrial practitioners may reconsider the choice of programming language in their projects.

Control engineers can use the power of assertion-based verification and automatic formal verification in the design of control systems to gain full confidence that the systems they design actually meet the specified requirements.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0238B0A6-AC55-4419-A479-F81CB0917FA8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56da0e1c48c322.59351415</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C29665F4-F77D-4A64-AE7E-1EC28E95DA82</gtr:id><gtr:title>Verification of control systems implemented in simulink with assertion checks and theorem proving: A case study</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/31feb0e32ba3546f7a72d09ef79fd499"><gtr:id>31feb0e32ba3546f7a72d09ef79fd499</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Araiza-Illan D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cb2fdeabb5a9.05514012</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>724E55BF-CA2B-435B-B576-7CD9EF1976E8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Verification and testing of mobile robot navigation algorithms: A case study in SPARK</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/eef65ed9b79ca6f146eb5d15beb7363f"><gtr:id>eef65ed9b79ca6f146eb5d15beb7363f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Trojanek P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5461470dc3d9f6.72736633</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C3770AD3-C747-4CF8-975F-BD204A6C135D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Formal verification of control systems' properties with theorem proving</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/31feb0e32ba3546f7a72d09ef79fd499"><gtr:id>31feb0e32ba3546f7a72d09ef79fd499</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Araiza-Illan D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54613f8242eda2.41682728</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CD353D6B-7278-4196-ADD7-84CF7B8534F0</gtr:id><gtr:title>A fuzzy approach to qualification in design exploration for autonomous robots and systems</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e3bd14ffb9b7ab991718399116fcf230"><gtr:id>e3bd14ffb9b7ab991718399116fcf230</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morse J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a3bbd5b18c269.50996983</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J01205X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>95</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
