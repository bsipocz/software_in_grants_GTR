Contemporary developments in media and political structures, such as the expansion of commercial broadcasting and weakening of political partisanship, further elevate the role of the media.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project starts from the understanding that the news media can influence political knowledge and we further advance this understanding, by using a cross-national approach, to understand under which conditions the news media matter. For decades, researchers viewed the media as having a minimal effect on opinion and behaviour. More recent work has revised those conclusions but the empirical record is mixed with some studies reporting positive effects for the mass media while others report null or even negative effects.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Through developing and comparing new techniques for assessing media effects using existing large cross-national surveys linked to media content, the project aims to more clearly specify the role of the media on opinion and behavior and under what conditions the media matter. This project also demonstrates the potential for secondary data analysis to address major debates within and across political communication and media studies. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By linking cross-national media content, political and media systems we are able to understand how both institutions and the information they produce for citizens, influences individual behaviour and thus how changes to institutions and information may affect behaviour. As the media is understood to be a major influence on individual behaviour, this global framework allows us to address the ESRC's strategic priority of influencing behaviour and informing interventions. Based on the research outputs, the proposed secondary data analysis project will produce a set of recommendations on regulatory policy and journalistic practice that will inform debate at EU and national government levels about the roles of public funding, campaign regulation and competition in producing quality information and engaging citizens. In light of ongoing discussions regarding media (e.g. Leveson inquiry), the use of secondary data will allow us to quickly identify and deliver policy recommendations. Beyond regulatory policy recommendation, understanding information and behaviour in context has broad implications for policy prescriptions about behavioural change. 

1. Potential Policy and Societal Impact
- Globalisation and economic integration mean that policy makers, commercial and third sector organisations are interested in cross-national comparisons, and even cross-cultural comparisons within a single country. The research findings will contribute towards evidenced based policy making in the area of media regulation. The findings will give clear indications of funding models and the impact of market competition on the production of electorally relevant information. Public broadcasters in particular are interested in fulfilling the remit of informing citizens and can base policy recommendations on the output regarding media systems and information. Furthermore, policy recommendations will emanate regarding engaging citizens in representative democracy that may be of interest to bodies such as the Leveson Inquiry in the UK. These recommendations may also include reforms to the electoral rules. An impact advisor (see Pathways to Impact) will ensure these policy impacts are optimised.

 - The user community outside academe is large and diverse. It consists of all those institutions and individuals who have a professional interest in media, media regulation, elections and electoral processes. One segment of this extra-academic user group is centered around political parties: elected office holders, party officials, campaigners, and those working in research institutes and thinktanks connected to political parties. A slightly different group consists of those representing social groups and organised interests and who equally have a stake in the outcome of elections, and sometimes in providing their members with relevant information and advice (labour unions, employers organisations, churches, sundry cause groups, formal lobbyists, etc.). Another component consists of media organisations and journalists who provide audiences (the mass audience as well as more specialised and targeted audiences) with information on elections. Finally there is a plethora of firms (mainly, but not exclusively, SME's) that cater to the rest of the extra-academic user community (market research companies, media an campaign specialists, consultancy firms, etc.).

2. Research Area Impact
Another benefit of the research is to the UK Research Area: The visibility of the UK as a venue for research on matters pertaining to electoral behaviour, electoral representation, the role of the media, the emergence and transformation of party systems and democratization will be promoted. Furthermore, our international collaboration with partners in the US will help to ensure the impact extends beyond the UK.

ESRC Data Sets: Secondary Analysis of Qualitative and Quantitative Data
Session leader: Prof Susan Banducci
Analysing existing data sets is a useful way of practicing methods of analysis, developing new insights, validating primary data and broadening the scope of an original study. The ESRC has invested in a number of longitudinal studies and all funded projects are required to archive and share data. These resources offer the researcher great opportunities for exploring existing research and conducting original research. In this workshop we will cover the advantages and approaches to secondary analysis of data, how to find data and how to prepare data for your own project. The workshop will involve practical work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56decb51403919.19940083</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ESRC Secondary Data Analysis Showcase</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0E8475FE-32C7-4BE8-910B-1D0ECE276E5C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I facilitated the Government &amp;amp; Politics Group at this event hosted by the ESRC. ESRC are holding a showcase of the Secondary Data Analysis Initiative (SDAI) targeted at policymakers in the afternoon of Monday 29th February 2016 at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, 12 Great George St, London, SW1P 3AD. The event is an opportunity for attendees to learn more about the SDAI and to help shape future research themes and partnerships.

The event will demonstrate the potential for the SDAI to generate policy insights through showcasing the impacts of previous projects. There will also be thematic breakout sessions where delegates will have an opportunity to discuss their research priorities and how SDAI could be used as a mechanism to address them. The aim is to develop ideas for future research themes and proposals that could be submitted to the SDAI in the future in collaboration with partner organisations. The sessions will be led by the interests of attendees but are likely to cover themes such as: Health, Wellbeing and Ageing; Education; Economics and Business; Equality and Social Mobility; Politics and Governance; and International Development.

Speakers include a keynote from Dr Tim Leunig (Chief Scientific Adviser, Department for Education) and SDAI award holders from each of the three phases. Each breakout session will be facilitated by an academic who is part of one of the projects funded under SDAI.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9800402bc9.86526569</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Final Dissemination Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2D3852E-5009-4EF8-8128-3147A21FAA43</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our final project workshop and dissemination event was held in London on 16 June, 2014 at NatCen. 
Over 20 participants registered for the event to listen to presentations of three papers from the project. This was followed by a panel discussed which generated discussion on the conduct of research on media across countries. The expert panel was comprised of practitioners from social research agencies and consultancies. They gave feedback on how to structure the research to optimise its impact on policy.

Following this workshop we were contacted about submitting written evidence on media and voter engagement to the Political &amp;amp; Constitutional Reform Committee.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5429df798bdf43.50044778</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://mediaeffectsresearch.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/media-effects-workshop-in-london-monday-16-june-2014/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Data Citation: You Should Do it</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6811146B-9D21-446C-AB76-446640D0A7DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lecture to Speed Updating Event

We have been less successful in engaging media regulators. We have been unable to engage our initial impact advisor, the BBC's Director of Editorial Policy and Standards, in our dissemination activities.

Our project funded under the ESRC's Secondary Data Analysis Initiative asked whether media coverage of politics serve to educate and engage them or have the opposite effects? Does it increase extant knowledge gaps among the public or close them? The answers to such questions tell us a great deal about the health of a democracy. However, previous research which relies on (mostly) survey research and to a lesser extent surveys combined with media content has come up with a variety of conflicting answers. Why? There are several possible reasons, but among the most likely is that researchers do not always use the most appropriate methods to examine media effects (e.g., often looking at people's media habits but not at the actual content of the coverage they expose themselves to) and that they are not always comparing like with like, i.e., media effects in one country may differ from those in another for very good reason.
In this project we used three publicly available secondary survey data sets--the 2009 European Election Study, 2006, 2008, and 2010 European Social Survey, and 2005-2010 British Election Study Panel--to 1)examine the substantive issue of the relationship between media coverage and political knowledge and engagement, and 2) develop and test different methods of gauging media effects with secondary data. All of our analysis combines media content (direct measures of the extent of information available to citizens) with surveys (citizen's self-reports of exposure to news media).
We count our key findings as:
? Using matching procedures and data from 67 elections across Europe, we show that higher levels of electorally relevant information in newspapers tend to increase turnout differences between readers and non-readers. Through causal mediation analysis we show that campaign interest is what drives these differences.
? Using data from the 2009 European Election Study, we demonstrate that the availability of information in the news media about a party increases knowledge about its position, party information in non-quality news reduces this gap more than quality news because those consuming low quality news know less. 
? Merging the first 5 rounds of the European Social Survey with a database containing thousands of national events, we demonstrate a greater degree of heterogeneity when it comes to how citizens react to political developments. In particular, some events generate significant opinion changes when groups of individuals who are &amp;quot;treated&amp;quot; are compared to &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; cases. Thus both strong and weak media effects that scholars have uncovered over the years are a function of methodological choices as well as context-specific factors such as institutional arrangements, media-systems, eras, or event characteristics.
- Using media content and survey data from two British elections (2005; 2010) to test the three traditional methods of examining media effects on political preferences. Presenting the methods side-by-side serves as a robustness check for each of these models separately. We find that the substantive results are highly method-dependent illustrating the contextual nature of media effects. Other than thinking of media effects as an one-off phenomenon, we need to think of them as partly conditional on study design features and thus the type of variation under scrutiny.
 - In examining the impact of media systems on news coverage, we find that for public service broadcast outlets, the negative impact on both soft news and horse race coverage is lessened when greater electoral competition (the race is closer). Therefore, when there is a competitive electoral situation there is a greater likelihood that an outlet will carry stories about polls on public service broadcasters.
 - In a laboratory experiment setting, we were able to establish that misreporting of news exposure derives from habit and leads to both over and underreporting of news attention. Recall of specific details of a news item was aided by altering the question wording.
- Merging the all waves of the European Social Survey with the political events database, our analysis suggest that some events generate significant opinion changes when groups of individuals who are &amp;quot;treated&amp;quot; are compared to &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; cases.
However, other events produce modest or even null findings with methods that employ different counterfactuals. Thus, findings of both strong and weak media effects that
scholars have uncovered over the years could be a function of methodological choices as well as context-specific factors such as institutional arrangements, media-systems, eras, or
event characteristics. Data limitations also make some research designs possible while they preclude others. 

We draw two conclusions from the above research:

o Researchers should examine different methods where possible in order to check the robustness of claims of &amp;quot;media effects; 
o Many of the contradictory findings result from invalid measures of a survey respondent's exposure to news media. 

? Based on the above, we conducted experiments to determine appropriate measures of media exposure. The experiment tested how the form of the question affected over-reporting of exposure and accuracy of recall. We found that the form of the question (specific versus general) did not affect accuracy of reporting. However, the more general question led to over-reporting of media exposure.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings can be by those interested in promoting democratic participation and those more generally interested in examining how media interventions might influence attitudes and behaviour. 

In terms of democratic participation, we have demonstrated news information can mobilise citizens via making them more interested in the campaign. Therefore, those wishing to promote greater participation in the electoral process can promote policy initiatives such as increased funding to parties and increased free air time will make elections more competitive, increasing the interest in the campaign and perceived benefits of voting. This increased media coverage will also promote greater knowledge of political parties allowing citizens to make more informed decisions and improving the accountability functions of elections. 

In terms of our methodological advances, those using existing surveys to study how exposure to media message influences behaviour and attitudes are encouraged to adopt our strategies of comparing across different methods of within and between subjects design with links to actual media content. Using multiple methods provides a robustness check for effects that are often small and at the same time highly conditional.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>63396437-4E4D-4CF4-B2A8-6766C132EFB7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546498a8c60ad4.32337495</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://mediaeffectsresearch.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Political and Constitutional Reform Committee (House of Commons)- UK Voter Engagement -- Oral Evidence</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>576BA16B-4359-4B6B-B33F-C03020064D18</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54269a27d71161.64573408</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/news/voterengagement7/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Written Evidence to Commons Select Committee Inquiry on Women in the House of Commons after the 2020 Election</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A944FFE5-8BA8-46AE-A028-1A14AD935E7F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c940e18596f7.45045835</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/women-and-equalities-committee/news-parliament-2015/women-in-the-house-of-commons-launch-16-17/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Political and Constitutional Reform Committee (House of Commons)- UK Voter Engagement - Written Evidence</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4F24A16-2C3C-4029-90C8-BBF4E4CD3658</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54269aaa586ca0.50768770</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/voter-engagement-in-the-uk/written/11058.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Voter engagement in the UK:Fourth Report of Session 2014-15</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E45587FE-953D-4541-8D58-E017B90F4F10</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546b5246c329e9.61138165</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpolcon/232/232.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This data represents individual responses to survey items from successive European election studies (1999, 2004 and 2009) linked to media content data measuring the amount of news information available to respondents.</gtr:description><gtr:id>593116BD-B6CD-46B9-BAD4-0C94BD847772</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The database is used in a paper currently under review.
