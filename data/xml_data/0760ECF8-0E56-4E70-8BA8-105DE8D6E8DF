infections in crops using next generation sequencing</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/N023293/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Viruses that infect crop plants in the UK causes significant losses in terms of yield and quality. In the UK, the production value of the potato harvest is &amp;pound;684 million per year, but the losses due to some viruses are estimated to be &amp;pound;30 million. Hence, the need to quickly and accurately identify virus infected crops is of importance both economically, and to ensure the continued supply of food adequate for a growing population.

Current techniques for virus identification only allow the detection of single or at best a very small numbers of related viruses. This makes disease diagnosis slow and expensive. Plant viruses can be identified from their genetic material, which is commonly RNA. It is possible to sequence the genetic material contained within samples extracted from an infected plant. This genetic material comprises a mixed collection of the host plant's RNA and the RNA of multiple viruses (and other organisms) that infect the plant. Technology can be used to sequence this mixed genetic material, which gives a very large data set of millions of short reads of RNA. A major difficulty is the identification of virus sequences within the mixed data set, and the ability to do this in a short enough time period to allow for successful disease diagnosis. Ideally we require a software tool that can take RNA samples and produce a list of viruses present with a matter of days rather than weeks. To date there is no software that can make successful plant virus diagnosis in a sufficiently short timeframe. The aim of the project is to develop software that will take the millions of short reads of RNA from a mixed sample and produce a list of viruses present for accurate diagnosis and so that effective disease treatments can be deployed.

The software comprises two elements (a) identification and removal of plant host RNA reads and (b) identification of known and potential new viruses. The identification of RNA viruses in mixed RNA samples is difficult, due to their hi sequence variability meaning that even if a related sequence is present in a reference database the differences may be too great to detect the similarity by alignment. In addition alignment methods, in which short RNA reads are aligned against a reference genome and assembled, are too slow for diagnostic purposes. In this project we will develop a bioinformatics tool that will overcome both of these problems. 

We will use a method known as k-mer counting to identify the viruses present. RNA sequences can be treated as character strings and divided into multiple substrings of length K. In this way a sequence can be represented by k-mer profiles, and these profiles can be compared to identify which species are present in a mixed sample. In addition we will test the use of a speedy aligner that will enable us to identify the host RNA more quickly if a reference genome is available. We will integrate these methods to create a pipeline. The tool will be delivered through Galaxy, an open platform for intensive data analysis, making it widely available to researchers. It will be designed to be used by the non-expert user. The tool will be tested on RNA sequence data from infected raspberry plants and from potato plant material. The tool will have direct applications in plant health, quarantine and certification procedures, used to stop the spread of crop diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Viruses cause significant yield and quality losses in a wide variety of agricultural and horticultural crops, and have an important negative economic impact. Hence, plant virus diagnosis is a field of great significance in terms of the UK's food security and the agricultural economy. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of infected plant material is now a principal focus for viral diagnostics, but it requires fast and robust bioinformatics tools for host sequence and virus identification. Both of these aspects are missing in current software, which in general has been developed for clinical diagnosis. There are no tools for crops that go beyond sequence homology for virus identification that can be used by the diagnostician and give results in a rapid time frame. 

The aim of this project is to develop a bioinformatics tool that uses mixed RNA sequence reads from infected plant material to produce a viral index in an accelerated timeframe to support disease diagnosis. Such a bioinformatics tool would have direct applications in plant health, quarantine and certification procedures. The tool will include a method for k-mer profiling, which goes beyond sequence homology, for the detection and identification of known and new viruses. The project will also explore the use of a speedy alignment method for plant host extraction, when a reference genome is available. The tool will be developed within Galaxy as a workflow, making it widely available to the non-expert. By using an open workflow platform, the tool will have the potential to be used on a cloud based Galaxy server, which makes it available to researchers without significant computing infrastructure, such as those in developing countries. We will develop and test the bioinformatics pipeline on already collected RNA-seq data from virus infected raspberry plants and potato plant material, but the tool will be applicable to a wide variety of crop plants.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Purpose of this Project is to develop a bioinformatics tool that uses RNA sequence reads from infected plant material to rapidly produce a viral index for disease diagnosis; with applications in plant health, quarantine and certification procedures. Rapid and accurate virus detection is an essential part of efficient crop management, offering protection against economic losses due to low yield and poor quality. Viral diagnostics is a key component of ensuring security and sustainability of food production both in the UK and in developing economies with low-input farming systems. 

The key output from the project is the bioinformatics &amp;quot;pipeline&amp;quot;. The primary impact of the project will be realised when the pipeline is used for virus identification in new and existing next generation sequence datasets by the beneficiaries worldwide.

There are a large number of academic beneficiaries of this project, including researchers involved in disease diagnosis for plant quarantine and certification purposes, crop breeding and those establishing diagnostic tools for cops in developing countries (see previous section). In addition this project will have direct impact on farmers, horticulturists and other food producers who need to monitor the ongoing health of their crops and investigate new instances of disease as they arise. The speed of use of the bioinformatics tool will enable them to deploy appropriate crop management practices in time to maximise productivity and profit. James Hutton Limited, a commercial subsidiary of the institute has established the JHL Molecular Diagnostics Unit, which uses diagnostic tests for plant health assessment and crop genotyping. JHL has an existing customer base with excellent links to growers and agronomists. Therefore, the software pipeline developed by this project will be a major boost to the capabilities of this Unit.

Impact of the bioinformatics pipeline will be measured by recording the number of installs made from the Galaxy Tool Shed, by recording number of requests for collaboration using the pipeline, by recording the number of references to the pipeline in scientific and other publications, by recording approaches for use of or further development of the pipeline by other research institutions and commercial companies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>141589</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>York St John University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Spatial Epidemiology of a Vector-Borne Potato Virus: Interactions between Landscape, Hosts and Vectors</gtr:description><gtr:id>3C1CC608-1233-408C-8541-07A46DBE4259</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d857ef7de335.50755608-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>see web pages</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>see web pages

This allows in addition to control (22&amp;deg;C) and heat treatment (29&amp;deg;C) for the entire plant to separately apply heat stress to either aerial parts of the plants (leaves) or to the belowground organs (tubers). Working with the cv. Agria, physiological and phenotypic parameters were measured. These data suggest that there are also signals from the tubers which may control heat response. Detailed metabolite and transcript profiles were obtained under the different temperature regimes imposed. These experiments confirmed a negative influence of an altered source/ sink balance on tuber starch content. Interestingly the levels of the signalling metabolite trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) changed in leaves and tubers. Since T6P was reported to play a role in flowering regulation in Arabidopsis, we searched for candidate genes coding for T6P synthases (TPS by in silico analysis and identified 2 members of the family that show high degree of sequence identity to the active TPS1 from Arabidopsis. Their function and expression pattern is further investigated. Microarray analysis revealed numerous differentially expressed genes. Currently some candidates (FKF1, LOX etc.) are further analysed. Various experimental set-ups such as different day length periods (16h/ 12h or 8h light) were tested which in general confirmed that negative effects on tuber quality (tuber weight, second growth, dormancy) are more pronounced in long day conditions (16h light). Several experiments confirmed a reduced accumulation of starch in tubers when plants were grown under elevated temperatures. The activity of sucrose synthase (SuSy) correlates with starch levels and may serve as a molecular marker. To unravel the molecular mechanisms the heat / cold plate set up is used to identify genes correlating with expression of SuSy or other starch biosynthetic genes. In addition, genomic annotation of genes involved in starch metabolism was improved and this information is being used to identify co-regulated genes.
WUR group obtained evidence for the involvement of CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (StCDF1) and StCDF3 genes in abiotic stress (heat and drought) sensitivity in potato plants. StCDF1 protein also transcriptionally represses StCO1-3 genes, a set of transcription factors able to indirectly repress the potato tuberigen StSP6A. Transgenic plants with reduced expression levels of StCDF1 showed high level of tolerance to drought and higher tolerance to heat stress. Interestingly, plants over-expressing StCDF3, another gene of the same family repressed by StCDF1 also presented a higher tolerance to drought and clearly improved growth and yield during heat treatments. Plants with different levels of StCDF1 presented a strong stomatal conductance phenotype, being lower in plants with low StCDF1 expression. Furthermore, in early potato genotypes, with more stable StCDF1, stomatal conductance is also greatly reduced. Transgenic plants with low expression of StCDF1 also have a decreased basal transpiration rate and they are extremely resistant to drought stress. On the other hand, a decrease in the transpiration rate has a negative effect on yield and plant production under heat stress. They explain the antagonism between treatments as a consequence of the miss-regulation in the StCDF1 gene expression, and concomitant incapacity of the plant to properly coordinate the induction of tuberisation with the needs of photosynthetic capacity under circumstances of environmental challenges. If transpiration is interrupted by stomatal closure due to StCDF1/StCDF3 miss-regulation, the major plant cooling mechanism is lost. They have established Chromatin Immune precipitation (ChIP) for potato. As a first approach we set up the experiment with the StCDF1 target genes StCO1-3. We show that StCDF1 protein binds close to ORF in StCO genes. Consistent with the ChIP result the StCDF1 binding site (AAAG) is preferentially present close to, or in 5&amp;acute;UTR ORF chromatin regions. They now also generated a SUC2 regulated GFP-tagged StCDF1 protein in potato. These plants will be used to carry out ChIP-seq analyse of the regulatory activity of StCDF1 throughout the genome.
CSIC: Transgenic SP6A OE lines (35S promoter) in cv. Spunta and Sylvana backgrounds have been generated and characterized. Compared to wild-type plants an improved tuber yield was observed at elevated temperature together with reduced secondary growth. OE- lines accumulated more tuber starch and lower soluble sugars. Tubers from SP6A OE-lines sprouted later than controls during storage at 4&amp;deg;C. Microarray experiments with the transgenic lines have been conducted in collaboration with FAU and data analysis is ongoing. An initial heat stress experiment was performed including potato plants with increased levels of gibberellic acids (OE of AtGA20-ox1) and reduced amounts of strigolactones (CCD8-RNAi lines).These lines were obtained from JHI/StA. Compared to their respective wildtypes AtGA20-ox-OE lines did not exhibit significant differences in tuber number/ weight and dormancy period. CCD8-RNAi lines formed already under control conditions less tubers. Interestingly, these plants tended to form aerial tubers under the conditions used which will be further analysed.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The molecular basis of genotypic differences in response to elevated temperatures using potato germplasm collections and diploid populations. Using a genetic screen of a potato diploid population a large effect QTL has been identified that explains 12% of tuber yield variation in a model tuberisation system. A candidate gene associated with the QTL encoding a Heat Shock 70 protein has been identified and is being characterised. Alleles of this gene appear to underpin the yield phenotype. Transient expression studies indicate that expression of the Hsp70 gene confers tolerance to heat stress. Stable transgenic potato lines have been developed and will be assessed for effects on temperature stress. Further resolution of QTL for heat tolerance is underway using an exome capture array. A powerful acquired thermotolerance response has been observed in potato and the molecular basis of this response is under test</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Wisconsin-Madison</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Spatial Epidemiology of a Vector-Borne Potato Virus: Interactions between Landscape, Hosts and Vectors</gtr:description><gtr:id>6C38A7D5-DDBD-4DB4-BC43-89B29C8431B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d857ef7de335.50755608-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>see web pages</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>see web pages

Several experiments confirmed a reduced accumulation of starch in tubers when plants were grown under elevated temperatures. The activity of sucrose synthase (SuSy) correlates with starch levels and may serve as a molecular marker. To unravel the molecular mechanisms the heat / cold plate set up is used to identify genes correlating with expression of SuSy or other starch biosynthetic genes. In addition, genomic annotation of genes involved in starch metabolism was improved and this information is being used to identify co-regulated genes.
WUR group obtained evidence for the involvement of CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (StCDF1) and StCDF3 genes in abiotic stress (heat and drought) sensitivity in potato plants. StCDF1 protein also transcriptionally represses StCO1-3 genes, a set of transcription factors able to indirectly repress the potato tuberigen StSP6A. Transgenic plants with reduced expression levels of StCDF1 showed high level of tolerance to drought and higher tolerance to heat stress. Interestingly, plants over-expressing StCDF3, another gene of the same family repressed by StCDF1 also presented a higher tolerance to drought and clearly improved growth and yield during heat treatments. Plants with different levels of StCDF1 presented a strong stomatal conductance phenotype, being lower in plants with low StCDF1 expression. Furthermore, in early potato genotypes, with more stable StCDF1, stomatal conductance is also greatly reduced. Transgenic plants with low expression of StCDF1 also have a decreased basal transpiration rate and they are extremely resistant to drought stress. On the other hand, a decrease in the transpiration rate has a negative effect on yield and plant production under heat stress. They explain the antagonism between treatments as a consequence of the miss-regulation in the StCDF1 gene expression, and concomitant incapacity of the plant to properly coordinate the induction of tuberisation with the needs of photosynthetic capacity under circumstances of environmental challenges. If transpiration is interrupted by stomatal closure due to StCDF1/StCDF3 miss-regulation, the major plant cooling mechanism is lost. They have established Chromatin Immune precipitation (ChIP) for potato. As a first approach we set up the experiment with the StCDF1 target genes StCO1-3. We show that StCDF1 protein binds close to ORF in StCO genes. Consistent with the ChIP result the StCDF1 binding site (AAAG) is preferentially present close to, or in 5&amp;acute;UTR ORF chromatin regions. They now also generated a SUC2 regulated GFP-tagged StCDF1 protein in potato. These plants will be used to carry out ChIP-seq analyse of the regulatory activity of StCDF1 throughout the genome.
CSIC: Transgenic SP6A OE lines (35S promoter) in cv. Spunta and Sylvana backgrounds have been generated and characterized. Compared to wild-type plants an improved tuber yield was observed at elevated temperature together with reduced secondary growth. OE- lines accumulated more tuber starch and lower soluble sugars. Tubers from SP6A OE-lines sprouted later than controls during storage at 4&amp;deg;C. Microarray experiments with the transgenic lines have been conducted in collaboration with FAU and data analysis is ongoing. An initial heat stress experiment was performed including potato plants with increased levels of gibberellic acids (OE of AtGA20-ox1) and reduced amounts of strigolactones (CCD8-RNAi lines).These lines were obtained from JHI/StA. Compared to their respective wildtypes AtGA20-ox-OE lines did not exhibit significant differences in tuber number/ weight and dormancy period. CCD8-RNAi lines formed already under control conditions less tubers.

This allows in addition to control (22&amp;deg;C) and heat treatment (29&amp;deg;C) for the entire plant to separately apply heat stress to either aerial parts of the plants (leaves) or to the belowground organs (tubers). Working with the cv. Agria, physiological and phenotypic parameters were measured. These data suggest that there are also signals from the tubers which may control heat response. Detailed metabolite and transcript profiles were obtained under the different temperature regimes imposed. These experiments confirmed a negative influence of an altered source/ sink balance on tuber starch content. Interestingly the levels of the signalling metabolite trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) changed in leaves and tubers. Since T6P was reported to play a role in flowering regulation in Arabidopsis, we searched for candidate genes coding for T6P synthases (TPS by in silico analysis and identified 2 members of the family that show high degree of sequence identity to the active TPS1 from Arabidopsis. Their function and expression pattern is further investigated. Microarray analysis revealed numerous differentially expressed genes. Currently some candidates (FKF1, LOX etc.) are further analysed.

Meeting was attended by personnel from UK and USA collaborator labs. The meeting aimed to discussed research accomplishment and future plans. Richard Harrington of Rothamsted research has now retired and James Bell has taken over on the project and will continue to provide advice and information on aphid phenology data in UK.

Pankaj Kumar (Research fellow) presented the experimental data for the UK team. MPR onset experiments showed no systemic movement of PVY-O into foliar tissue at the flowering stage in all cultivars tested (Desiree, Atlantic, Maris Piper and Shepody). In addition, resistance was observed against PVY-N and recombinant strains (PVY-NTN, PVY-NWi) in foliar tissues of all cultivars except Shepody. However, examination of PVY infection in tubers from plants inoculated at flowering stage showed that the recombinant strains can infect tubers of all cultivars even at the flowering stage. Thus, MPR does not protect tuber infection by recombinant PVY strains. This is the first report MPR study against recombinant PVY strains. 
CFDA translocation experiments to study solute transport have backed up and explained the above result. There was no CFDA transport from the inoculated leaves to systemic leaves at the time the plant is flowering, but there was still a (reduced) level of CFDA transport to tubers; sufficient to allow virus infection. 
GFP-tagged PVY-N was studied in the inoculated leaves at four developmental stages and was found to enter the phloem at all stages, suggesting that phloem entry is not a limiting step to virus infection, even at flowering when MPR protects foliar tissues.
Furthermore, identification of a marker for the MPR stage was done using FTIR. Two markers were identified that correlate to oxalate levels increase in source leaves from tuber-development stage onwards, and reduction in nitrate level at the flowering stage. These markers would be useful to predict MPR to help understand when plants had some protection against PVY-O. However, since we have now shown that MPR is not effective against recombinant PVY strains and these recombinants are the most prevalent infection pressure today, the use of these markers is probably of limited utility.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb837c65db55.18191476</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference: Advances in plant virology 2015, Birmingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BB886ED3-4DD6-44AE-A789-4B0378D81C39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pankaj Kumar (Research Fellow, University of St Andrews) presented a talk titled ;Studies on Mature Plant Resistance Against Potato Virus Y in Solanum tuberosum L.; at Advances in Plant Virology 2015 conference.

Outcomes from 8 months research work since the begining of project were shared. Lesley Torrance (University of St Andrews/JHI) briefed the audience that onset of mature plants resistance (MPR) was studied in four potato cultivars using four PVY strains (PVY-O, PVY-NWi, PVY-N and PVY-NTN). For this, PVY infection in non-inoculated upper leaves was checked at four growth stages of potato plants. Early results showed that PVY-O infection in upper non-inoculated leaves was stopped at tuber bulking stage. However, PVY-NWi infection in upper non-inoculated leaves was stopped at last growth stage i.e.. flowering stage. Solute transport from source leaves to sink tissues was studied to find out any change in phloem transport after MPR onset. These studies were completed until tuber bulking stage and results did not show any change in phloem connection or unloading. Solute transport at flowering stage was not finished.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb1762c93424.79805656</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project Meeting_Dundee_31.03.2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>10361B53-2D64-46F4-A62E-3A39E2C34EFE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Almudena Trapero Mozos presented the progress from StA/JHI.

Work has been conducted in two aspects of this project. 
? A Galaxy workflow has been created using standard NGS analysis tools (including host removal and virus identification by mapping) to take raw RNA-seq data and produce an initial list of viruses present. This workflow matches reads to the RefSeq dataset of viruses (which comprises &amp;gt; 7000 genomes). This workflow has been tested on African groundnut RNA-sequence data, which has been sequenced as part of a Royal Society network grant. We are currently analysing initial results and working on a protocol for further analysis of the unmapped reads to recover additional viruses.
? We have created a synthetic data set of RNA-sequence reads which comprises a plant host and a number of known viruses. This dataset is being used to assess a tool that can match reads to sequence databases using k-mers. We are currently testing and optimizing parameters for virus recovery in the synthetic dataset, and also to create our own k-mer database of plant viruses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>outcomes will be relevant to a number of groups in due course - project still ongoing</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>81B00CD2-1718-4936-9085-7D511C68EA89</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c4311d8896e4.09557364</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A number of standard basic DNA pieces, named GBparts, were used as a starting point in the building of Hsc70 multigene structures.

This technique measures the absorption of infrared radiation by the sample material versus wavelength. The spectrum collected represents the molecular
absorption and transmission, creating a molecular fingerprint of the sample. Like a fingerprint no two unique molecular structures produce the same infrared spectrum. This makes infrared spectroscopy useful for several types of analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9BB7AF87-F2AA-4B45-B93A-7171F30F1195</gtr:id><gtr:impact>FTIR was used to identify key molecular changes during growth development of potato plants and associated with MPR. We identified two markers that correlate to oxalate levels increase in source leaves from tuber-development stage onwards and reduction of nitrate level at the flowering stage. These markers would be useful to predict MPR to help understand when plants had some protection against PVY-O.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb8ab428bd08.91944155</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>NimbleGen technologies allow researchers to selectively target DNA sequences of interest in their genome of interes either through focused exomes or custom designed gene panels, for variant discovery and validation.

Microarray utilises microscope slides that are printed with thousands of tiny spots in defined positions, with each spot containing a known DNA sequence or gene. Often, these slides are referred to as gene chips. The DNA molecules attached to each slide act as probes to detect gene expression, which is also known as the transcriptome or the set of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts expressed by a group of genes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D245327F-C6D2-4534-AE38-DAB9C4168306</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We determined the whole genome transcript profile of Atlantic leaves which were inoculated with PVYNTN, PVYO and sterile water (mock treatment) at 6-leaf (pre-MPR stage) and flowering stages (MPR stage). Inoculated leaf tissue samples were harvested at 1, 4 and 8 dpi and subjected to whole genome transcript profiling using the 60K array of the potato genome. Sequences of the expressed transcripts were received recently and we are starting to analyse the data. We hope to discover MPR-associated genes which are differentially expressed between PVYNTN and PVYO inoculated leaves as well as between the 6-leaf and flowering growth stages. Preliminary analysis after 2-way ANOVA and pairwise comparison (mock vs. each PVY strain) at each time point showed that a large number of genes were differentially expressed in PVYO and PVYNTN treated leaves at the 6 leaf stage compared to the same treatment at the flowering stage.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589d08ea8a2a61.42225797</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Microarray</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5AA719AA-DC6D-49C6-808E-ED48CCBD4DE7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Viral Diagnostics in Plants Using Next Generation Sequencing: Computational Analysis in Practice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in plant science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66"><gtr:id>6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-462X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fce18806f60.32283698</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N023293/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
