The aim is to give occupants a voice and in addition to find ways of avoiding the technical jargon of innovative housing design. The aim is also to disseminate some of the more technical research findings to a wider audience, one more concerned with policy and practice. In this context, two particular methods are employed. First, a community arts or film company will make a short video about how the occupants use the heating and other features of low carbon/ low energy housing and how in general they see this type of home and estate. Secondly, an interactive forum will be created on the web, where interested parties can see the videos, deposit and look at other sources of information and also communicate amongst themselves. The proposal mirrors a shift in the use of the web from a one-way means of disseminating information to a two way means of promoting a conversation.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposed follow on study deals, in part, with the implementation of national carbon reduction targets. The benefits of carbon reduction, the assessment of which is outside the scope of this proposal, are long-term and concern society in general. In the short term, the major beneficiaries of this study comprise two groups; first, the occupants of innovatory low energy/ low carbon housing and secondly, the various agencies that develop and manage such schemes. In relation to the potential impact on urban development, the developers and managers are obviously the most important. However, this is a user-oriented study that includes, of necessity, the voice of users.

The occupants of low energy and low carbon housing gain from lower bills or increased comfort levels or a combination of the two (Jackson, O'Flaherty and Pinder, 2009: Pett and Guertler 2004). An aim of the present project is to identify the issues involved in communicating good practice in minimising energy bills at an acceptable comfort level. At the same time, the benefits for the developer and landlord are not obvious. The experience, noted by the present proposers in previous studies, is that low energy design and the provision of renewables have (as yet) had little impact on market valuations or rents. In any case, taken overall, high initial costs may overwhelm subsequent savings. Much depends on the payback period and the way in which the users use their home. Where the developer also becomes an energy supply company, a further range of risks arise in relation to local pricing policies, billing and arrears.

Social housing agencies face another risk. Theories of the home, as well as the historical evidence suggest that, amongst low income and low status groups, housing expectations are moulded by images of the 'normal' and the 'abnormal' (Goffman 1971), that departures from the normal risk undermining notions of 'ontological security', the individual's sense of order and continuity (Giddens 1991: Kearns et al 2000; Walshaw 2011) and that, therefore, innovatory housing can prove unpopular, even if low rise (Furbey and Goodchild 1986: Goodchild 2008, 91-92). Despite the typical wishes of social housing developers, the functional requirements of low carbon/ low energy design encourage unconventional solutions, in relation to both the interior (for example, sealed windows) and the exterior (orientation towards the sun, rather than the street). Private developers face similar dilemmas. However, the greater choice open to purchasers, combined with the influence of valuers and short-term financial constraints, means that private developers have been cautious about the adoption of innovatory design (Ball 1999). 

In the context of such uncertainties and dilemmas, the impact of research is unlikely to rest on the application of specific findings. Instead, as has been noted in other exercises in environmental research (Phillipson and Liddon 2007), the impact is likely to derive from making practitioners more aware of the issues involved, the risks and the possibilities. The design of this follow on study is intended exactly to promote such awareness, through a combination of outputs that include interactive web-based learning methods.

The disciplinary background and experience of the proposers also serves to promote practical impacts. The proposers include a technologist/ engineer (O'Flaherty) and two social researchers/ housing and planning specialists (Goodchild and Walshaw). The mix will help promote the exchange of ideas, as is necessary in any attempt to apply knowledge. The proposers have very extensive experience of working with practitioners in consultancy and research and in making presentations to large and small groups of practitioners. Finally, this previous experience provides a substantial amount of data relating to the costs and performance in use of renewable technologies (O'Flaherty) and to the users' experience (Goodchild and Walshaw).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47880</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department of Energy and Climate Change</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Low Carbon Pioneer Cities Heat Networks Project: a process evaluation</gtr:description><gtr:id>05769874-2259-4D4D-98A8-F6484428C266</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work in progress</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545f3aaa2c9f87.41775208-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners are the resaerch client and set the brief</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Systematic evaluation of a heat networks programme</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Wandle Housing Association</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The implementation of biomass district heating</gtr:description><gtr:id>C343F471-F1DA-4C9F-AC06-197D9FE7575C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d94ed2b9d94ef0-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Details the management constraints that hinder bioth the development of biomass district heating in social housing and prevent tenants from gaining the maximum benfit in terms of reduced fuel bills.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of South Australia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Barbara Hardy Institute</gtr:department><gtr:description>Building Project: User perspective in purpose built low energy housing</gtr:description><gtr:id>AE7AD15C-B8CE-43CB-9BD3-63D394742D0A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is multi-disciplinary.

The scheme in Nottingham provides an example of a specialist developer identifying a niche market of consumers. The schemes in Rotherham and Greater Manchester provide examples of social housing developers responding to policy imperatives in favour of innovation and to additional funding opportunities.

Despite the character of this study as an exercise in knwoeldge transfer, the response of residents provides an insight into the different issues involved in the development and use of these two types of innovative housing. The prospects for expanding niche housing in the private sector depends on the size of the potential market, not just for committed green consumers but for cost conscious green consumers such as those currently in living in inefficient older housing. For private developers, much also depends on whether they can provide the 'bonus' aspects of the eco-home without sacrificing costs or other aspects. The prospects for innovative social housing depend essentially on the funding regime. However. social housing developers might still pay attention to the preferences and demands of their tenants. The social housing tenants in the present study all welcomed the prospect of lower energy bills. However, they found difficulty coping with technical complexity and with non-standard fittings and were also commonly suspicious of any unusual design features, notably the 'upside-down' layout. 

Complexity was also an issue for those who had bought their home, though it did not figure as prominently in the interviews. An understanding of how best to use eco-feature is a necessary precondition for those features to be used correctly. If the home is not used correctly, low energy/ low carbon designs will, almost certainly, not realise their potential. A logical response, as the social housing landlords have recognised is to train staff so that they can provide more support. In the longer term, however, the answer is surely to introduce technical systems that are simpler to control.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The films prepared as part of this project can be and have been used for training purposes within housing agencies. They might also be used for consumer education, indicating to potential house buyers and tenants what they might expect. There is a real need for more consumer education on these matters. Eco-homes make demands on life-styles that is not easily appreciated in advance. The context for exploitation is the adoption of national targets for domestic energy and carbon reduction, namely that the housing stock should be approaching zero carbon by 2050. The targets necessitate innovation in housing design. The findings can therefore be used directly by housing developers in the private and public sectors. For the public sector, the findings indicate the need for more support and guidance in the use of new technologies. For the private sector, the findings indicate a possible range of niche markets- not just green consumers but consumers wanting well-designed modern homes with low running costs. For all housing developers and for the manufacturers of heating and renewable energy equipment, the findings suggest that overcomplexity and poorly designed control systems are obstacles to the widespread adoption of innovative technologies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>01E287FD-C57D-49BB-B9B7-F5C5D931266D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5322551257.277421775f43e6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.facebook.com/MyEcoHomeSHU?fref=ts</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Housing Association Practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1AA51BDC-A5C3-4621-AD28-BAE316BC24A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two housing associations participated in the resaerch.
