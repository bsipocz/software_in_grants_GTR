The FLIP placement was at two locations: Warwick Ventures and Mologic.
Warwick Ventures
Intensive initial training within Warwick Ventures was provided by a business development manager mentor. Throughout the project Warwick Ventures staff were available to offer help and support. Subsequently external training was provided with the assistance of a patent lawyer employed on the development, management and protection of IP and impact. A summary of the work programme is:
? Worked on a number of very different case studies within life sciences but also in engineering, manufacturing, medicine and chemistry.
? Managed the output from the BBSRC Pathfinder project that preceded the FLIP award, including following up commercial leads.
? Taught on a postgraduate training module within the BBSRC funded PhD programme (MIBTP). This covered impact, IP and commercialisation.
? Designed and conducted a University wide translational research survey to scope where development is needed. 
The main benefit for Warwick ventures was to have a trained researcher within the department. Indeed following the success of the 3 month award I was appointed a &amp;quot;Ventures Fellow&amp;quot; which is a new position within the University. If this pilot is successful other candiates will be choosen in other depeartments. Already this has allowed me to engage with colleagues at Life Sciecnes including senior Professorial staff and PhD students passing on the skills and advice he learnt and directing them to Ventures. For example at the recent postgraduate symposium during the poster presentations I was able to advice a number of students about the potential to exploit their impact. 
Mologic.
The placement within Mologic coincided with a major review with a possible sale of the company. This did not directly impede the project and increased the scope of some of the work carried out. 
A comprehensive report on the market for a prototype assay was prepared (details are confidential).. This report was well received by Mologic. As a result the University now has a strong long term relationship with Mologic.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C4087B92-8C97-44E0-9035-FF4D6B8DB32D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5559ac70827ec0.10061309</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Dr Gould was exposed to a very broad range of commercially-focussed activities. The training he received has provided a very solid foundation for future commercial exploitation of his work. Dr Gould was able to play a central role in both Warwick Ventures and Mologic in advancing commercial projects. As a member of Warwick Ventures Dr Gould ws involved in the successful application for a BBSRC Impact Acceleration Account. A particularly welcome outcome was Dr Gould's establishment of a training module for postgraduate students which he will continue to deliver in the future. Finally, Dr Gould has been given a position as the Warwick Ventures Fellow with a role as the contact for assessment of new projects for commercialisation potential.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The FLIP scheme is an excellent opportunity for young staff to be exposed to teh commerical exploitation of research.
