PBDEs are brominated flame-retardants that have been used extensively as additives in plastic materials for the prevention of fire in items such as consumer goods like electronics, furniture foams, and fabrics, as well as industrial materials. Over time, these man-made additives have migrated into the environment with resultant human exposure via air inhalation, ingestion of indoor dust, and dietary ingestion. Such exposures are of concern owing to the mounting evidence of potential human health risks for humans, which have led to bans on the manufacture and new use of PBDEs within the EU. Concerns have also been raised for some time about the toxicity of brominated dioxins, which are thought to be emitted as products of incomplete combustion from a range of thermal (largely industrial) processes. Recent research elsewhere in the world has highlighted the potential for the emission of PBDEs and brominated dioxins from steel making. The objectives of this project are thus to evaluate whether such findings are applicable to the UK steel industry, and if so, to assess the environmental and human health implications. The project will involve an extensive monitoring programme of air and soil within and around a major UK integrated steel works. The samples will be analysed by the student at the University of Birmingham and Corus. The involvement of Corus is especially valuable as it provides access to and training in the use of a particularly sophisticated instrument that is essential for the determination of brominated dioxins but is unavailable at Birmingham. In addition to training in transferable research skills, the student will receive specialist training in air monitoring techniques and analysis of PBDEs at Birmingham, as well as process emission monitoring and analysis of brominated dioxins at Corus. Furthermore, the time spent working at Corus will provide the student with invaluable experience of a non-University research environment. A further training element will be provided by a 2 month study visit to Antwerp University. Here, the student will benefit from immersion in an internationally-renowned academic research environment outside the UK, and will procure relevant Belgian samples which when analysed will help place UK data in an international context. In summary, the student will study an area of environmental research undergoing rapid growth, within a research group of high international standing, and with substantial input and support from a key end-user. In so doing, they will receive an exceptional training experience in experimental design and execution, analytical and environmental chemistry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>70053</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/G01146X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
