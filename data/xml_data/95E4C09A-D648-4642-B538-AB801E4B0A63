&lt;ul> 
 &lt;li>raise the quality and analytical rigour of doctoral dissertations in economic and social history, whether the period be modern, early modern, or medieval; &lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>improve the communication skills of postgraduates; &lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>widen their approach to their subject areas; &lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>and encourage them to form networks with established scholars and fellow students in their areas of expertise.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul> 
&lt;p>The course is open to 12 graduate students, who will be in their second or third year of study at the time of the course, and consists of a series of plenary sessions, based on each student?s dissertation, plus workshops dealing with advanced qualitative and quantitative research methods. The plenary sessions are complemented by small group demand-led training sessions that offer advanced discussions in particular methods. Five academics, with research interests relevant to the topics of the student participants, will be recruited to attend the course. The course is residential over a 3-day period.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22415</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>From the final report on the grant in 2011:
