As a distinctive art form Screendance is frequently equated with the work of the American dancer/ film-maker Maya Deren in the 1950's and has proliferated since the late 70's. However, despite its traditions, extensive history and a growing international interest, Screendance has not established or defined its own critical discourse.\n\nFollowing from Screendance conferences organised by key researchers in the UK and USA since 2006 including: Opensource: (2006, 2007) Scotland; Screendance: State of the Art (2006, 2008); USA: and Moves: Choreography for the Screen, (2007, 2008), Manchester, this network will facilitate a vital and effective dialogue between UK and US based researchers and their various research centres. Together, the USA and UK lead the field with the major outputs dedicated to the genre thus far being 'Envisioning Dance on Film and Video (Mitoma, Routledge, USA,) 'Dance on Screen' (Dodds, Palgrave UK); 'Making Video Dance' (McPherson, Routledge UK); 'Anarchic Dance' (Aggiss/Cowie, Routledge, UK).\n\nThe proposed research group is made up of: Claudia Kappenberg (University of Brighton, England), Katrina McPherson (Dundee University, Scotland), Marisa Zanotti (Chichester University, England), Dr Christinn Whyte (Middlesex University, freelance writer), Prof. Douglas Rosenberg (University of Wisconsin, USA), Prof. Anne Cooper Albright (Oberlin College, Ohio USA), Harmony Bench (UCLA, USA).\n\nOur proposed activities include the following:\n Twice-yearly seminars (autumn and spring) for the core research group addressing the following: \n\n1.Examination and critique of the existing body of literature; 2. Development of methodological forms of enquiry and scholarship appropriate to the field; 3. Systematic debate and investigation of Screendance in the context of current cultural and philosophical debates; 4. Exploration of the language of Screendance including its choreography, curation and dissemination. \n\n Invited guest contributors will include: Prof. Ian Christie, Birkbeck, University of London (Film Studies); Prof. Noel Carroll, Temple University, USA (philosophy and cross-disciplinary discourse); Catherine Wood, Curator, Tate Modern (curation and publishing); Bob Lockyer, former Executive Producer of Dance, BBC TV; Dr Sherill Dodds, University of Surrey, author of Dance on screen: genres and media from Hollywood to experimental art (2001)tbc.\n\n Research and development of a new research-focused Screendance website, supported by both UoB and DJCAD, which draws together research centres worldwide and makes available existing literature, the online publication of research-in-progress and strategies for curation, commissioning and dissemination. The website will facilitate a wider network that includes a range of audiences including established and early career researchers, experience scholars and festival directors.\n\n To secure the ongoing dialogue and an international forum for Screendance debate, the network will review comparable journals and liaise with publishers to build on and develop an already existing proposal for a new dedicated journal for Screendance. The proposed website will be structured in such a way as to develop into an online presence for the Screendance journal.\n\n The network will conclude with the a final symposium that will specifically support and encourage participation from early career researchers and practitioners worldwide and provide the opportunity to launch and disseminate the collective work of the Network and plan future research development. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36959</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Video, year of production: 2013, UK.

The festival was conceived by a group of artists and researchers, Claudia Kappenberg, Becky Edmunds, Lucy Cash, Chirstinn Whyte, in collaboration with Gill Clarke from Independent Dance. It followed an invitation by filmmaker Lucy Cash, who was awarded a Grant by the Arts Council England. The festival was supported by Artsadmin, South East Dance, the Goethe Institut and University of Brighton.

It combined work from film, dance, live and visual art and hosted ten writers as part of the event. The writing was published in a special issue by the Dance Theatre Journal (2011), edited by Lucy Cash and Theron Schmidt.

It disseminated the research of the Screendance Network and launched the first issue of the International Journal of Screendance. Guest speakers were Catherine Wood, Curator Contemporary Performance, Tate Modern; Siobhan Davies, Choreographer; Miranda Pennell, film-maker and David Hinton, film-maker. Claudia Kappenberg (PI, Screendance Network) and Prof Sarah Whatley (Co-I, Screendance Network) convened the conference.

The event brought together academic theoreticians with non-academic filmmakers, choreographers and dancers as well as a curator form the visual arts, to debate questions posed by the International Journal of Screendance.

Each seminar had a theme and certain objectives to advance key aspects of the research, such as Screendance Histories, Interdisciplinarity, Curating Screendance and Publication and Dissemination.



The first three seminars took place at the University of Brighton (September 2009), at Coventry University (January 2010) and the University of Madison, Wisconsin (June 2010). The fourth seminar included a public symposium and again took place at the University of Brighton (January 2011), which also hosted a fifth seminar of the UK members of the Network in December 2011.

The original plan was to develop an outline for a dedicated, international journal of Screendance in the course of the seminars, which could be submitted to Routledge for consideration, but instead the second seminar of the Network lead to the decision to independently set-up a dedicated, peer-reviewed journal for screendance as a matter of priority. Support was secured through the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and its publishing arm Parallel Press. The Netork subsequently achieved its aim to publish the first issue in 2010, and it was launched at the American Dance Festival in Durham, North Carolina.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6280257018.5440190ba1351c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient
