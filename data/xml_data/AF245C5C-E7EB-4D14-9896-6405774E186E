The aim is to explore the output of radio and television during the period from 1979-1990, particularly in relation to the public services and the concept of 'the public'.\n\nThe research will undertake an inventory of programming in the period 1979-1990 across all terrestrial television and radio channels. It will create a database of programmes which deal with the topic of 'the public', and specifically with changing patterns of public ownership and the public services. It will consider all broadcast genres, from news and current affairs to comedy, drama, chat shows and television advertising. To this end, it will be necessary to locate sources of information on the broadcasting output during the period.\n\nHaving established the basic data, the research will analyse the representation of the public services and the ways in which the concept of 'the public' was mobilised in the broadcast discourse.\n\nIt will then go on to focus on questions of the health service and on public health as a detailed case study.\n\nThis textual analysis will analyse and illustrate the implicit and explicit attitudes conveyed by the programming across the genres /for example the extent to which the programming was supportive of, or opposed to political changes. it will consider the language used to speak of the changes and their consequences, and the examples, both fictional and factual, which were put forward. It will consider the ways in which broadcast programmes mediated and interpreted political initiatives.\n\nThis analysis will be related to:\na. an account of the politics of the 1980s, specifically the evolution of the Conservative government's policies in relation to 'rolling back the state', privatisation and denationalisation, and the changing ideological discourse\nb. the specific economic and organisational changes which were occurring within the National Health Service. The research team will bring specialised background knowledge of these changes.\nc. the context of broadcasting itself, and the debate around its role as a 'public service'.\nThe period of this study covers the launch of Channel Four and its innovative programming across the 1980s, which itself involved a re-definition of 'public service' in broadcasting; and also the Peacock Report on the de-regulation of broadcasting and the future of the BBC.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91943</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British Film Institute (BFI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>National Film Theatre season on medical drama.

Following speakers included Tony Stoller, Chief Executive of the Radio Authority 1995-2003; Tom O'Malley, Professor of Media Studies, Aberystwyth Univeristy, Colin Leys, Honorary Professor at Goldsmiths, University of London.

The audience were active participants in the discussion which followed the presentations. They included concerned activists as well as academics.
