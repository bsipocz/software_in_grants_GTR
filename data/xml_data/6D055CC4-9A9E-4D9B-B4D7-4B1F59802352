The stresses of particular importance in the UK are drought, high temperature and atmospheric pollution. Current climatic conditions will become both less optimal for growth of primary UK crops and more uncertain, as temperatures rise, summer precipitation declines and predictability decreases. Globally the problem is even more significant. Hence abiotic stress already has a major impact on crop yields, significantly through the cessation of growth under conditions of mild stress. Growth arrest arises from a cessation of cell division in meristems, and recent work shows clearly that the cell cycle stops in G1 phase in response to changes in anti-oxidant pools (specifically glutathione [GSH] and ascorbate [AA]), which themselves are a measure of abiotic stress. A further link between abiotic stress and the cell cycle is suggested by the finding that downregulation of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) gives significantly enhanced stress tolerance. The same enzyme links cell cycle and stress in animals. This project will combine the expertise and know-how in AA and GSH synthesis and metabolism and whole plant physiology at Rothamsted with that of the Cambridge laboratory in cell cycle regulation and microarrays to elucidate and characterise the components that regulate cell cycle progression in response to modulations of GSH, AA and PARP and to extend this by identifying components that link abiotic stress to plant growth. We wish to understand the specific interfaces between these pools and activities and the cell cycle, and to further analyse the role and mode of action of PARP in conferring stress tolerance. The collaboration is essential for the success of the research programme as it exploits the unique toolsets available between the Rothamsted and Cambridge labs. This includes mutants with altered glutathione or ascorbic acid metabolism, multiple antiobodies, CycD::GUS reporter lines, transgenic plants lines with altered expression of cell cycle components, Arabidopsis cell lines that have the capacity for synchronisation and an extensive and growing set of bioinformatic data on gene expression and protein profiling in the same cell line. The project follows three broad phases of work which are integrated between the two labs: (1) Characterisation of the effects of GSH, AA and PARP levels on cell division in the Arabidopsis suspension culture and identification of core cycle genes modulated by GSH and or AA and or PARP. Importantly the approaches will utilise transgenic manipulation of enzyme activities as well as chemical inhibitors. Cell cycle analysis will focus on cyclin D genes as the ultimate regulators of the commitment to cell division. (2) Identification of global changes in gene expression resulting from changes in GSH, AA and PARP levels, with specific focus on genes that could act as potential upstream regulators of cell cycle genes in mediating GSH, AA and PARP control of cell division. (3) Further analysis of the candidate upstream genes to confirm that they are involved in controlling cell cycle entry in response to GSH, AA and PARP levels.

The plant cell paradigm has been shown to be a useful a model for the study of nuclear GSH and its functions in other organisms. For example, this study led to the characterisation of Arabidopsis mutants lacking the nucleoporin called ALADIN, which has implications for studies on this protein in relation to human disaease.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>593FB293-2657-4433-B94E-6674DBF0C8B7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545f9de88e0679.76150865</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>All life is based on reduction-oxidation (redox) systems. Living organisms use anabolic reductive processes to store energy and catabolic oxidative processes to release it. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that redox controls and signals are important regulators of nearly every aspect of cell biology. Indeed, redox signalling was probably the first type of sensory regulation that evolved in nature, because it prevented uncontrolled &amp;quot;boom and bust&amp;quot;, scenarios in energy availability, utilisation and exchange. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide and antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione are part of the rich portfolio of signals that contribute to the regulation of whole cell redox stability or homeostasis. Cellular redox homeostasis is a crucial regulator of cell fate in mammals and plants and that regulated changes in the abundance or accumulation of oxidative (e.g. ROS) and reductive (e.g. pyridine nucleotides, glutathione and ascorbate) signals can exert a major influence over the mitotic cell cycle that underpins growth. Ascorbate is the most abundant low molecular weight antioxidant in plants where it fulfils essential functions in growth and development. Glutathione is a tri-peptide that has a thiol (SH) group. It also plays a key role in root and shoot development. Using plants cells growing in liquid culture we have shown that amounts of ascorbate, glutathione and pyridine nucleotides vary independently during exponential growth and we have provided evidence for the differential regulation of each of these redox pools. We have found that glutathione moves from the cytosol to the nucleus early in the cell cycle. Depletion of the glutathione pool causes net glutathione synthesis the cytosol. We have produced evidence of a link between the glutathione pool and enzymes working to repair DNA in the nucleus such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). There is a strong correlation between PARP expression and activity and GSH accumulation. Moreover, the finding that GSH can be recruited to the nucleus suggests a relationship between redox regulation and nuclear enzyme activity. The three major conclusions of our work are:

1. The pyridine nucleotides, ascorbate and glutathione are regulated independently during the growth of Arabidopsis cells in culture. 

2. Glutathione is recruited into the nucleus early in the cell cycle, the ratio of glutathione in the nucleus and cytosol being an important regulator of growth and defence processes. 

3. There is a strong correlation between the abundance of glutathione and PARP gene expression and enzyme activity during the cell cycle.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings demonstrate that glutathione is important regulator of the cell cycle, leading to new concepts of redox regulation of nuclear proteins during cell proliferation in plants and animals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A8508C99-88F4-48D2-846B-BF0F88C085D7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f9d1278a5e2.76585373</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FCB42A85-05ED-40C4-BA7F-34C031247717</gtr:id><gtr:title>Recruitment of glutathione into the nucleus during cell proliferation adjusts whole-cell redox homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana and lowers the oxidative defence shield.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4107b4599be0c693b815f9296de4c447"><gtr:id>4107b4599be0c693b815f9296de4c447</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vivancos PD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0960-7412</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758e6599ede</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>17D72046-C2AA-45CB-9D88-5B31CDFCF8D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Plant homologs of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter, PfCRT, are required for glutathione homeostasis and stress responses.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6dfd8c1c9e960b2cfea80ce217556b86"><gtr:id>6dfd8c1c9e960b2cfea80ce217556b86</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Maughan SC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758cfb6775e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2676B81A-95A9-4398-B97D-FAA5DF10652A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The transcription factor ABI4 Is required for the ascorbic acid-dependent regulation of growth and regulation of jasmonate-dependent defense signaling pathways in Arabidopsis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Plant cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e219ddd9c13455db2f11a1ecac7c33f5"><gtr:id>e219ddd9c13455db2f11a1ecac7c33f5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kerchev PI</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1040-4651</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758f9af396d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>13428590-C651-42E2-AAAC-DAB045927B87</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pyridine nucleotide cycling and control of intracellular redox state in relation to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activity and nuclear localization of glutathione during exponential growth of Arabidopsis cells in culture.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular plant</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1e4393ec441492925ec9d4c581560b82"><gtr:id>1e4393ec441492925ec9d4c581560b82</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pellny TK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1674-2052</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758c86e8b88</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>27AB9D23-5FB7-47AE-8C6A-12953C734A0B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Conditional modulation of NAD levels and metabolite profiles in Nicotiana sylvestris by mitochondrial electron transport and carbon/nitrogen supply.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Planta</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a78aeec4c00ad1bb1f55d3b640891346"><gtr:id>a78aeec4c00ad1bb1f55d3b640891346</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hager J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0032-0935</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758d2f7ef68</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/C51508X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
