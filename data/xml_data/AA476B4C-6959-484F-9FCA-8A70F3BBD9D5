About 3800 new cases are diagnosed annually in the United Kingdom. Despite treatment over 35% of patients diagnosed will die within 5 years. 

STS treatment generally involves surgery to remove the tumour and radiotherapy. Crucially following treatment 50% of cases return (recur). This either occurs at the same location as the original tumour (local recurrence) or at a different part of the body (metastatic recurrence). Both are difficult problems to manage. Local recurrence often requires additional (often extensive) surgery, whilst metastatic recurrence almost always proves incurable with a 3 year survival rate of just 25%. 

The ability of clinicians to offer curative treatment to patients with STS recurrence is dependent on early detection. In cases of local recurrence in a limb, earlier diagnosis also reduces the likelihood of an amputation being required. At present no reliable tests (biomarkers) exist that can sensitively diagnose STS recurrence. As a result recurrent tumours are often extensive when they are detected, precluding curative treatment. 

DNA outside of cells circulates at small concentrations in the blood. In patients with cancer, some of this DNA originates from tumour cells (circulating tumour DNA or ctDNA). In some cancers the characteristics of ctDNA change as the tumour grows or spreads. If accurate ways to detect these changes in patients with STSs were discovered, clinicians may, for the first time, be able to monitor a tumour's behaviour and response to treatment with just a simple blood test. 

This year we have developed new tests and used these to identify ctDNA in patients with metastatic STSs for the first time. Next we plan to monitor specific characteristics of this ctDNA in blood tests we are currently collecting from patients throughout their follow up. We will then correlate these characteristics with clinical outcome so we can determine their potential as new tests to pick up STS recurrence, or even identify those patients at highest risk of recurring before they undergo initial treatment. If validated this may allow clinicians to identify disease recurrence earlier than by current means, and so offer curative treatment in a higher proportion of cases. They may also facilitate a more personalised approach to patient care by allowing clinicians to adopt more intensive radiological follow up regimes in the most aggressive cases identified prior to treatment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Despite treatment, 35% of patients with high-grade Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STSs) die within 5 years. Crucially, 50% of STSs recur following surgery. There are no biomarkers of this recurrence, and only limited systemic treatments for patients with metastatic disease. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) characteristics correlate with disease stage in some cancers. If assays were developed to characterise ctDNA in STSs, novel biomarkers may be identified. 

For a mutation to be a useful biomarker it should ideally be present in all cancer cells. A hallmark of tumour cells is their ability to divide an unlimited number of times - a process facilitated by Telomere Maintenance Mechanisms (TMMs). As TMMs are not utilised by differentiated normal cells, the presence genetic mutations associated with a TMM in ctDNA should act as a stable marker of STS cells. 

Our primary aim is to investigate the potential of ctDNA to monitor STSs patients. Using a bioinformatic approach and published literature we have developed a custom 'STS hotspot panel' for next-generation semiconductor sequencing. Using this panel we have identified ctDNA in metastatic STS patients for the first time. After assessing Telomerase and Alternative Lengthening of Telomere (ALT) activity in recruited STSs we next plan to develop highly sensitive Taqman assays for use in digital droplet PCR to target appropriate TMM associated mutations. Using these, and our refined STS hotspot panel, we will then track and characterise ctDNA in STS patients throughout follow up. By correlating ctDNA characteristics with outcome we will determine their potential as new biomarkers, which (if validated) may allow clinicians to diagnose STS recurrence earlier, and offer curative treatment more often.

Our secondary aim is to establish cell lines from primary STS tissue. After frozen stocks are developed, recovery assessed, and cell line DNA analysed, this would create new resources for those testing novel systemic therapies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) can occur at almost every age, and carry a significant morbidity and mortality. Despite this their relative rarity means they have often been neglected compared with other more common cancers in terms of academic research. 

STS recurrence following treatment is common, and the ability of clinicians to offer curative surgery to patients that recur is dependent on early diagnosis. In cases of local recurrence earlier diagnosis also reduces the likelihood of an amputation being required. This is obviously beneficial to patients individually, and society in general. 

The follow up of STS patients is not presently standardised in the UK, and local and distant recurrence is often extensive at the time of diagnosis. This is partly the result of a lack of reliable biomarkers. Chemotherapy is usually reserved for palliation of symptoms in advanced cases of STS, and holds no real curative role. Therefore although the discovery of accurate markers of STS recurrence would aid clinicians greatly, to significantly improve outcomes (particularly for patients with metastatic disease) more effective systemic treatments are also required. 

Using this MRC fellowship our primary aim is to investigate the feasibility of using circulating tumour derived DNA (ctDNA) to monitor patients with primary STSs. To do this I plan to track genetic mutations in STS patient ctDNA throughout follow up. We have already developed a custom semiconductor sequencing chip designed to target STS associated mutations in this way (novel work). We next plan on developing custom Taqman assays for use in digital droplet PCR for the same purpose. The development of these assays will benefit academic groups investigating STSs, ctDNA and telomere maintenance both nationally and internationally.

If we identify any ctDNA characteristics that may hold a role as future biomarkers they would need to be validated by others in larger, multi-centre trials. If a statistically significant relationship is found in these studies clinical oncologists and surgeons may be provided with novel tools to predict or diagnose STS recurrence earlier. This highlights a clear pathway between our research and patient benefit accruing. The validation work described above would also provide an excellent longer-term project for a clinical lecturer or clinical scientist.

Our secondary aim is to develop novel STS cell lines. These will provide an important resource for researchers testing novel or recycled drug therapies in metastatic STSs, and groups specialising in chemoprevention. This is a key area of STS patient management that needs development, as the response rate of STS patients to the current systemic therapies used remains low. 

Finally our project will help to increase the research portfolio of the Sarcoma Clinical Studies Group and the National Cancer Research Institute on a national level. In the short term, direct patient involvement and public engagement throughout the project will also help our research raise awareness of STS research locally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139867</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>30000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Rosetrees PhD Studentship - adapted to provide support for consumables only</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Rosetrees Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>A1076</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B6FB55D2-04BC-4737-9FCF-6C7074C0B521</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58a186004091c5.06633197</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A7E00F1F-B45B-4A33-8FF3-040F9DFB811E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Telomere maintenance in soft tissue sarcomas.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of clinical pathology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/98012d89a9623e1269fde2aa77fb2312"><gtr:id>98012d89a9623e1269fde2aa77fb2312</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eastley N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9746</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58a183ac3f9d68.10963249</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N02107X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
