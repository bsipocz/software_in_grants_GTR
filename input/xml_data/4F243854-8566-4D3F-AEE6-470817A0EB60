It increases the risk of fragility fractures that lead to pain and disability in addition to substantial economic and societal costs. Current osteoporosis treatments are only partially effective and their use is frequently limited because of side effects. Importantly, many of the mechanisms that are targeted by new osteoporosis treatments are also essential for normal bone health and were identified by studying families with rare inherited disorders with abnormal or fragile bones. 

Mutations in the gene PLS3 have recently been found to cause X-linked osteoporosis. This is a rare condition characterised by early-onset fractures in young boys. The PLS3 gene is inherited on the X-chromosome and since males only have one X-chromosome, a single abnormal copy of the PLS3 gene causes the disease. By contrast, in female relatives, because they have two X chromosomes, the single normal copy of the PLS3 gene on their second X-chromosome protects them from developing the severe form of the disease. Nevertheless, a common genetic variant of PLS3 has been found to be associated with fractures in the normal population, indicating that PLS3 has an important role in determining bone mass and strength. 

The function of PLS3 is unknown, but the human studies and our preliminary data from adult Pls3-deficient mice suggest that PLS3 has an essential role in both skeletal development and the maintenance of adult bone structure and strength. We have shown that mice lacking the Pls3 gene have osteoporosis, and we propose these mice represent an important new disease model in which to study the causes of osteoporosis and determine the function of PLS3. Detailed study of these mice will help us to understand the normal function of PLS3 in the skeleton and explain how mutations cause osteoporosis. This project will characterise new signalling pathways involving PLS3, advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying osteoporosis and identifying new drug targets for osteoporosis prevention and treatment. This project, therefore, has the potential to help not only sufferers of X-linked osteoporosis but also all those at risk of osteoporosis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Osteoporosis is the commonest skeletal disorder, and fragility fractures represent a significant and increasing healthcare burden in our aging society. Many key molecular mechanisms that contribute to osteoporosis were identified in studies of rare human monogenic skeletal disorders.

Our International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) skeletal phenotyping pipeline identified markedly reduced bone mass and strength in adult female Pls3 knockout mice. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in PLS3 have recently been identified in boys with X-linked juvenile osteoporosis, and a PLS3 polymorphism has also been associated with increased fracture risk in a large population study of post-menopausal women. PLS3 encodes Plastin-3 that binds to filamentous actin, but its function is unknown.
I hypothesise that PLS3 is essential for normal bone structure and strength, and that deletion of Pls3 in mice represents an important new disease model whose study will reveal the nature of the role of PLS3 in normal bone physiology.

The aims of my proposed research are to determine:
1) The developmental and adult skeletal phenotypes of Pls3 knockout mice
2) The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of osteoporosis in these mice.

Established advanced skeletal and cellular imaging, cell biology and molecular analysis techniques will be used to determine the skeletal, cellular and molecular consequences of Pls3 deletion. RNAseq analysis will determine the effect of Pls3 deletion on gene expression in specific skeletal cell lineages and facilitate the identification of gene networks and signalling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of bone loss resulting from Plastin-3 deficiency. 

Historically, study of the critical signalling pathways identified in monogenic skeletal disorders has led to the emergence of new osteoporosis treatments. The proposed project similarly has the potential to identify novel targets for drug development in skeletal disease.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of this project include-:
 
(i) Patients with osteoporosis 
 
Osteoporosis is a major public health problem, and osteoporotic fractures cause severe associated morbidity and mortality. Current treatments to prevent osteoporotic fractures, including bisphosphonate drugs, are unsatisfactory in terms of efficacy and side-effects. It is widely accepted that there is an urgent need for new osteoporosis treatments. Many recent new treatments for osteoporosis have had their origins in the study of rare monogenic skeletal disorders. PLS3 is a novel determinant of bone health whose function is unknown. This study of PLS3 will therefore provide new knowledge regarding the mechanisms of regulation of bone mass in health and disease. This may lead to the discovery of new treatment targets for which new medications could be developed in the future. Such new treatments could benefit a large majority of osteoporotic patients as well as those with the rare inherited condition of X-linked osteoporosis. Furthermore, patients with X-linked osteoporosis may benefit more immediately from validation of the osteoporotic PLS3 knockout mouse as an experimental disease model. Existing osteoporosis medications could be tested in these mice in order to inform optimal treatment selection in these patients.
 
(ii) Future pharmaceutical industry partners 
 
If new treatment targets are identified that facilitate the development of new drugs to treat osteoporosis, this will benefit future private sector drug company partners. Osteoporosis treatment is currently a growth area for pharmaceutical research &amp;amp; development, because any new treatment that obtains a FDA and EMA approval would have huge financial sales potential. 
 
(iii) Enhancing the prestige and success of British science 
 
Understanding basic physiological mechanisms that underpin the regulation of peak bone mass accrual and bone turnover is a scientific area of huge international interest because osteoporosis is key health care priority and major cause of morbidity and mortality. There are currently only a small number of research laboratories in British universities dedicated to skeletal bone research. This project focusing on an entirely new novel regulator of bone mass and strength will help ensure that important advances in bone biology continue to be made in Britain, and will help attract inward investment and talent from around the world. 
 
(iv) Academic and patient beneficiaries from other disease associations with PLS3 
 
Abnormal PLS3 expression has also been associated with spinal muscular atrophy, several solid tumours including breast and colon cancer, and cutaneous lymphoma (Sezary syndrome). Despite these associations, the pathological mechanisms involved have not been studied in detail. Thus, there is significant potential for molecular mechanisms of PLS3 action identified in skeletal cells to also inform future research in these other important and common diseases. 
 
(v) Providing early-career research training for the applicant
 
Bernard Freudenthal has the necessary passion, drive and talent to enable him to become a leading academic clinician scientist. Provision of funding for this early-career doctoral fellowship will provide the essential protected time to undertake internationally competitive research in laboratory at the cutting-edge of the field. The Molecular Endocrinology Laboratory can provide all the state-of the-art mouse skeletal phenotyping infrastructure, expertise and training required for this fellowship.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288309</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P018718/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>149FA87E-B8CD-4FFC-B515-EAD312BED03B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musculoskeletal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
