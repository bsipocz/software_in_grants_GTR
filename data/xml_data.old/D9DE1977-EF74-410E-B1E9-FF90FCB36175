It seeks to understand how some people are better able than others to survive and maintain good health despite experiencing similar levels of economic shock at the individual and household level.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Aim:&lt;/strong> The overall aim of the project is to understand the factors that promote or diminish people?s resilience to economic shocks, using a quantitative case-study of the Russian Federation in the post-Soviet period as it has experienced several waves of economic crises. The specific objectives of the project are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to identify the factors that promote or diminish resilience to economic shocks&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to evaluate resilience factors at individual, household, community, and population levels using multi-level models.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Methods:&lt;/strong> The project principally involves statistical analysis of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey dataset during the period 1994 to 2011.This will be supported by a systematic literature review on resilience, health and economic crises.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Benefits:&lt;/strong> The project will benefit policymakers in countries experiencing economic crises by providing evidence to develop policies that support individual and household resilience to economic shock and so alleviating social suffering and improving health.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential beneficiaries of the research include populations in countries affected by economic shock, particularly the more economically vulnerable populations. These populations may benefit from improved physical and mental health outcomes and quality of life as a result of the research and an associated effective policy response. However, this clearly dependent on the project team engaging with policy agencies to inform and convince them of the key messages arising from the project findings and encouraging policy agencies to implement an effective policy response to try and maximise the factors supporting resilience among populations experiencing economic shocks. 

In order for such benefit to occur, the key agencies that will need to benefit from the research include Government Ministries and department at the central and local level, WHO, The European Commission, the World Bank, and civil society organisations providing health and welfare support. Individuals at these agencies will benefit from the research by increasing their knowledge and understanding on the issue of economic shock, resilience and health and being able to utilise empirical findings to help develop appropriate evidence-based policies.

In order to ensure that the these agencies have the opportunity to benefit from the research we will utilise our professional networks such as at the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies to raise understanding of the subject, the research, and the key policy messages. This can be achieved through a variety of activities such as presentations at key meetings, workshops, and conferences and placing articles in the Observatory's EuroHealth magazine that reaches a large number of legislators and their advisors. We will also utilise traditional and new media opportunities to increase coverage of the key messages arising from the research to engage as wide an audience as possible, including the general public. These activities can utilise the LSHTM External Relations department and the Press team.

Our work will also benefit academics by improving conceptual and methodological understanding and strengthening the evidence-base on economic shocks, resilience and health. The intension is that these academics should be from different disciplines, such as sociology, economics and public health and epidemiology. Publications of academic papers and presentations at conferences will help ensure that other academics have the opportunity to benefit from the research. The project will also include a one day workshop on economic shocks, resilience and health which will provide a multi-disciplinary forum to discuss the issues, methods, and findings addressed in the project. Please see the Academic Beneficiaries Section for further details. 

These impact-related activities will take place as part of a broader impact strategy to develop a clear plan of activities, clear messages and activities targeted for specific audiences, and evaluating the pathways to impact through a range of indicators. Indicators of the success of activities to strengthen impact pathways include: the number of key meetings, workshops, and conferences in which the research findings have been presented or discussed; the successful completion of the LSHTM workshop and any associated outputs and spin offs; the number of academic publications and associated statistics; and types of media coverage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>122977</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration between the LSHTM and Oxford University</gtr:description><gtr:id>C4D5F33C-A162-49E8-A04A-55133FE2DC0B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcomes from this collaboration are still being drafted or are under journal review</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54526b5f7e7245.91309398-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Contributing to the study design, analysis and production of papers</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Leading the study design, analysis and production of papers</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of East Anglia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration between LSHTM and University of East Anglia</gtr:description><gtr:id>3BD7C607-35B0-45BC-9E82-9D186CA9C77E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There are no outputs yet as the project is only just about to finish</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54526bf6336ba5.31580044-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Advising on the design, analysis and production of the outputs for the research study.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Designing, analysing and writing-up the research study.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Health Economic Conference (Dublin)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B341935-728E-4787-9A58-F5A2395791EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation was attended by over 100 participants.

This work has helped to inform policy-focused agencies such as the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policy which is had a dedicated section on financial crises in Europe.

In turn, the European Observatory works closely with policy makers throughout Europe which helped to further the potential influence of our work.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>78057F69-E817-4644-B3A1-C18E48BFCCFC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545264b31fc063.70083060</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through our published systematic evidence review, we have discovered that despite widespread rhetoric about the importance of health resilience in the context of economic crises, there is a dearth of evidence which operationalises resilience factors. 
The limited data that does exist suggests that men's mental health appears more susceptible to financial crises than women's. Lower income levels are associated with greater increases in cardiovascular disease, mortality and worse mental health. Employment status is associated with changes in mental health. Associations with age, marital status, and education were less consistent, although higher education was associated with healthier behaviours. 

The paper we published using panel data analysis of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (1994 to 2012) showed that individuals exposed to economic shocks through unemployment suffered worse self-reported health overtime than employed persons. Among the unemployed specifically, men, those living in bigger and wealthier households, and those living in rural areas, were more likely to maintain or improve good self-reported reported health overtime despite becoming unemployed. 

Discussions in the project workshop and conference presentations confirmed the findings from our systematic review that there is a need for more conceptual and empirical research to better understand the epidemiology of health resilience during times of financial crisis. This includes the establishment of long-term panel surveys such as the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey and the German Socioeconomic Panel; and the inclusion of a greater range of variables able to capture more diverse protective elements such as social capital elements like social relations and networks, sources of support, and trust. 

A greater variety of analytical methods could also be employed to examine the causal relationships between risk and/or protective factors and health resilience outcomes. For example, methods such as dynamic modelling or structural equation modelling could be useful to examine underlying relationship between factors and causality. The use of multilevel modelling could better understand community- and macro-level influences on health outcomes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are clear recommendations to strengthen research on this issue. This includes supporting the estabishment of more longitudinal studies able to capture the temporal impact of economic crises on health resilience. These should also capture a greater range of information on the potentially protective influences on health, such as social capital. A greater range of analytical techniques could also be used. 

Our work helps to disentangle some of the risk and protective factors that may be of importance in economic crises and thus may inform health policies and activities to support more vulnerable populations. However, substantially more research is required to effectively address vulnerability and help build resilience.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B0ABDB49-607D-4BE5-A6A8-B3E489103199</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5452646c49ddc4.44721436</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1CAE1A00-5DF8-4E88-9BA1-6B4D5DBFE72B</gtr:id><gtr:title>A systematic review on health resilience to economic crises.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ed653d2c958380c23c79a2d30db67fbf"><gtr:id>ed653d2c958380c23c79a2d30db67fbf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Glonti K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>561fd5de060256.77343405</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>25D66443-AAE2-4ED5-B933-D00B685E1D8B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Economic shocks and health resilience: lessons from the Russian Federation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of public health (Oxford, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51df9ce914dcaeca5017448f7b5f9b40"><gtr:id>51df9ce914dcaeca5017448f7b5f9b40</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gordeev VS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1741-3842</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fca4255f727.17959483</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B7687FB-EFFA-414D-8AA1-F5B0F2F7514C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Economic shocks and health resilience.
