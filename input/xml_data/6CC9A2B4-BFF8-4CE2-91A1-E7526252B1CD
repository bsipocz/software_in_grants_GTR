It will develop novel approaches for specialising and improving efficiency of generalist software for particular application domains in an automated way. The developed techniques will be program-agnostic and thus applicable to any type of software. Therefore, they will allow to speed-up computationally intensive calculations that arise, for instance, in the field of bioinformatics or healthcare. This fellowship thus can contribute to driving research development in other fields of research by providing an automated way of adapting and speeding-up existing software used in a plethora of areas, both in research and in the industry. 

The project will utilise and develop novel methods in the field of software engineering, called genetic improvement, to achieve the goals of the project. Genetic improvement is a novel field of research that only arose as a standalone area in the last few years. Several factors contributed to the development and success of this field, one of which is the sheer amount of code available online and focus on automated improvement of non-functional properties of software, such as energy or memory consumption. 

Dr. Petke is a world-leading expert on genetic improvement, publishing award-winning work on automated software specialisation and transplantation. She won two `Humies' awarded for human-competitive results produced by genetic and evolutionary computation and a best paper award at the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis. This work was also widely covered in media, including the Wired magazine and BBC Click. The potential of genetic improvement for automating certain aspects of the software development process has thus been already recognised in the academic community and beyond.

Dr. Petke will collaborate with a UK-based company, called Satalia, which provides the latest optimisation techniques to the industry. She will apply deliverables of this project to automatically adapt and speed-up their generalist optimisation algorithms to particular classes of real-world problems. An example is specialisation of a general routing program to devising an optimal network for broadband connections. Therefore, the deliverables of this project will contribute to the UK economy by providing techniques that will automate the process of software specialisation for real-world optimisation problems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will have a revolutionary impact on the software development process. It will move the effort of modifying and adapting code from human to machine. By pushing the area of genetic improvement forward fully automated optimisation of large real-world software will be within reach.

The project will have a direct impact on the UK economy through collaboration with the industrial partner, Satalia. The company provides latest software optimisation technology to the industry. The project will lead to faster, automated solutions for Satalia, hence faster solutions to their clients. For example, Satalia optimised vehicle routes for a retailer to let more customers place orders without increasing fleet size. Similarly, generalist state-of-the-art routing algorithms will be automatically adapted for other route scheduling domains using techniques developed during the fellowship.

Through publishing at top software engineering and evolutionary computation venues and organisation of automated software specialisation and continuing the Genetic Improvement workshop series, deliverables of this project will be disseminated to academia. By releasing a tool for automated software specialisation via GitHub, other researchers will be able to optimise their software. More importantly, the techniques developed will be agnostic to the software being optimised. Therefore, researchers from fields outside of computer science will be able to use the tool. 

The automated software specialisation tool developed during the fellowship will be open source. Dr. Petke will advertise it on software developer fora to reach out to people outside of academia. Through seminars, advertisement and work with Satalia automated specialisation techniques developed will be released both to academia and industry. It is envisioned that the techniques will be adopted in real-world software automating the software adaptation and optimisation process.

The human vs. computer competition on automated software specialisation will allow students to learn and get involved in the genetic improvement field. Therefore, they will gain access to the latest technology and garner interest to pursue research in this novel field that has huge potential in changing the way people program nowadays by transferring the optimisation effort from human to machine.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>891504</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P023991/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
