This can occur spontaneously in young patients with no known underlying lung disease, called Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP). Many will require a procedure to re-inflate the lung. This occurs in around 3,000 people per year in the UK. Guidelines recommend treatment with a chest tube in the space surrounding the lung to help re-inflate the lung. This is connected to a bulky drainage system (underwater seal) which makes the patient immobile and requires the patient to remain in hospital for up to 8 days. For those patients where the initial drainage treatment does not work, surgery is required to fix the hole in the lung and allow the patient to go home. There are many theories regarding the cause of pneumothorax in these young patients: it is more common in taller people and those who smoke, but the true underlying problem is not clear. Some studies have suggested that &amp;quot;blebs&amp;quot; (bubble-like areas) on the lung may be to blame, whilst others suggest that the inflammation of the lung itself (on a microscopic level) is the cause. Around a third of patients will suffer with another PSP on the same side, within one year. However, this estimate is based on old data, and we cannot at present predict who will need to have surgery during their hospital stay and also who will have a recurrence and who will not. This leads to patients being managed in a generic and non-guided manner, due to lack of evidence in this area. 

This study will closely investigate a group of 120 patients with PSP, by measuring air leak using a digital suction device during drainage, detailed scans of the lung tissue and tests of lung function. Some patients recover quickly from this condition, however, in others the lung does not re-expand fully and they require surgery. At the moment, we cannot tell which patients will do well and which will not. For a common condition, there are many unresolved questions with respect to pneumothorax. This application intends to provide a meaningful answer in how best to predict the outcome for the patient, ultimately with a view to improving how patients are treated and &amp;quot;individualising&amp;quot; care.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims &amp;amp; objectives 
- Determine whether digitally measured air leak and its evolution over initial (3 days) treatment, can predict short term clinical trajectory in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), focussed on clinically relevant outcomes: requirement for prolonged drainage and need for surgical intervention. 
- Establish whether radiological surrogates (on CT scanning) of emphysema-like change and markers of lung inflammation can predict long term outcome (recurrence rate over 1 year follow-up).
- Investigate the histopathological basis of PSP by examining histological specimens from patients requiring surgical intervention for evidence of lung inflammation, and correlation with clinical and radiological evidence of inflammation.
- Investigate the physiology of PSP: comparing dynamic pulmonary function testing, with novel techniques: laser gas analyser and Xenon enhanced MRI.

Methodology
120 patients from Oxford and four pleural UK centres will be recruited for detailed physiological and radiological investigation, and close clinical follow up based on protocolised management: including method of drain insertion, daily treatment regime and objective outcome criteria. Based on observed event rates, 120 patients retains sufficient power to validate four objective clinical parameters for a prediction model for patient relevant outcomes (prolonged air leak, need for surgery) from reproducible and robust criteria.

Opportunities
This study will provide novel insights in to an under-investigated and common respiratory problem, both from the scientific and physiological perspective and for clinical decision-making. If prediction parameters are demonstrated to be robust, with an estimated 3000 PSP per year there are opportunities for significant improvement in patient experience as well as cost savings to the NHS, which will be the subject of future research areas and applicable to other areas (traumatic pneumothorax, post-thoracic surgery).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The correlation of physiological parameters (e.g. air leak measurement) and clinical outcomes will is novel and may for the first time allow evidence-based prognostic predictions to be made.

Patient benefit:

Establishing robust clinical predictors (such as air leak) of clinical outcome has the potential to entirely alter the current management paradigm in pneumothorax. Earlier identification of pneumothoraces which are unlikely to resolve with drainage alone would promote sooner referral for surgical treatment, rather daily assessments for up to two weeks in hospital, resulting in non-specific management and the risks of prolonged hospital stay. If it is possible to recognise patients who will resolve air leak early, this may allow triage to a less interventional treatment strategy, saving time in hospital and the need for invasive procedures. Importantly, this data may allow informed discussions with patients regarding their likelihood of prolonged air leak and their personal likelihood of recurrence, enabling evidence based discussions to occur about the need for elective surgical management earlier in the disease process (for example, potentially with 48 hours of first admission with pneumothorax).

NHS benefit: 

The potential benefits to the NHS are large, with an estimated 3000 patients / year experiencing pneumothorax. With ever-increasing pressure on NHS resources and budgets, strategies to earlier identify which patients will require further intervention are vital in reducing healthcare costs and pressure on limited in-patient bed spaces. Prolonged admission to hospital for these young, fit and generally in work patients has impacts in terms of complications and loss to the economy in general.

Timescale:

The proposed study will fully conclude within the 3 years of funding, on the basis of the Oxford Respiratory Unit's track record of similar pleural trials. Such trials have recruited more than 1000 patients in to multi-centre and randomised studies and answered clinically important questions which alter treatment decisions. The conclusions of this study will be submitted for publication in high impact journals, and would be expected to be incorporated into national clinical guidelines within the following 1-2 years. The results of these studies will then become the platform for a programme of further research assessing different treatment paradigms in pneumothorax, using the methodologies and outcomes developed in this proposal. Therefore with 5-10 years, this research has the potential to influence clinical treatment paradigms on a day-to-day level for clinicians and patients across the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>205026</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Nuffield Department of Population Health</gtr:department><gtr:description>Epidemiology - Nuffield Department of Population Health</gtr:description><gtr:id>8BB4D35E-6B90-42E7-8357-66CF8FC32029</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented initial results at British Thoracic Society conference December 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc7dfb99c447.07974740-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Working with the Nuffield Department of Population Health (University of Oxford), using their large Hospital Episode Statistic database, we intend to analyse the epidemiology of spontaneous pneumothorax over the last 40 years in England.
