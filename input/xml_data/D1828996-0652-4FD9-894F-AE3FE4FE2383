In particular, the discovery of causal relationships is fundamental in public health and epidemiology, in life and earth sciences, in sociological studies and in econometrics. The traditional approach for such causal discovery based on randomised trials is impossible and even unethical in some of the most important applications. For example the investigation of the impact of environmental factors, such as smoking or exposure to specific chemicals, on patient health cannot be studied by randomly allocating patients to a group that would be exposed to a potentially very harmful factor. In such cases, the only way to identify causal links among a large set of variables is to exploit the growing abundance of observational studies. 

Most of the algorithmic approaches to causal inference from observational data rely on statistical tests of independence and conditional independence between variables. The most widely used existing independence and conditional independence tests in causal discovery, such as Pearson correlation and partial correlation, can only test for linear dependencies. While these approaches are very efficient if the relationships are indeed linear, they are blind to the type of intricate relationships present in the most challenging applications where dependencies are in fact highly non-linear. To correctly detect these relationships one needs to not only go beyond linearity assumptions, but also to use non-parametric approaches that make no assumption on the form of dependence between the variables.

The project is concerned with developing a non-parametric statistical method to test for conditional independence in a Bayesian framework. The Bayesian setting will provide a rigorous statistical grounding and the non-parametric aspect of the proposed approach will allow greater robustness and sensitivity. This new approach will be beneficial for scientists, epidemiologists and econometricians by facilitating the detection of previously unknown relationships between variables.

To ensure that the method can be used by the widest audience of researchers, its implementation will be distributed in an openly available software package in the R statistical programming platform. A website will be dedicated to the method and its practical applications, including simple examples illustrating the use of the R package.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Scientific disciplines where this project will have impact are extensive, including public health and epidemiology, life and earth sciences, sociology, economy and forensic science. Discovery of causal relationships is fundamental in all these fields. The proposed project will enable the detection of previously unknown relationships between variables. As a consequence, scientists will be able to make better and more informed decisions when addressing key UK societal challenges such as decisions in the Public Health sector. The methods developed in this project will be disseminated to the relevant communities via a website dedicated to the method and its practical applications. An open-source R-package will allow the output of this project to be promptly and easily accessible for all to use.

A whole quarter of this proposal is devoted to applying the novel method with partners. This participates in a genuine drive to empower decision-makers at the national and internal policy level. The datasets on which the PI will apply her methodologies are all focused towards policy-making: they span the range from novel therapeutic approaches for digestive disease to the impact of water contamination and air pollution on human health. Her partners at the School of Public health and at the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health have a track record of informing UK governing bodies such as Public Health England, and international bodies such as the World Health Organisation. These are established pathways with built-up trust and ongoing communication and expectations, through which the methodologies coming from this proposal can be put to direct use.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100731</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R013519/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
