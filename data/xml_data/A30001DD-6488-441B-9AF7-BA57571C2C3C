Trials of the Self Administered Interview Recall Tool</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/H022201/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>In response to the problem of obtaining high quality witness evidence quickly, efficiently, and with minimal police resources available, Gabbert, Hope and Fisher have developed a recall tool, called the Self-Administered Interview (SAI), that can be used to elicit a comprehensive initial statement from witnesses at the scene of a crime. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The SAI is a protocol of instructions and questions that support eyewitnesses when recollecting and recording their memories of an incident. Across an extensive research programme the SAI has consistently been found to strengthen episodic memory such that forgetting is reduced, and individuals are inoculated against misleading post-event information. Such benefits are likely to transfer to real-world witnessing situations. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The primary aim of the project is to conduct field trials with witnesses to actual crime incidents. The research project will explore the real-world benefits of the SAI as an evidence-based, practical and effective tool in the field. A second objective is to deliver effective and appropriate knowledge transfer so that end-users are aware of the SAI product, the key supporting research, and ultimately, the advantages of the SAI as a tool for the early elicitation of high quality information from witnesses.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28737</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Netherlands Police</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnerships with the Police</gtr:description><gtr:id>BA61F952-363B-439B-BECA-3B9FA6F8218A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To date, approximately 1000 officers within the Greater Manchester Police force, have been trained with respect to the origins, purpose and procedures relating to the SAI&amp;copy;. Specifically officers and senior investigators are trained how to make use of the SAI in appropriate daily operational context and identify when use of the SAI&amp;copy; will contribute to a criminal investigation. Training is delivered in both classroom and modular online formats that have been specially prepared within GMP. Use of the SAI&amp;copy; is also taught on all formal Investigative Interviewing Courses (approximately 20 courses per year) as a 'proactive investigative tool '. 

Furthermore, via the North West Regional Investigative Interview Champions branch, Senior Interview Advisors at regional forces including Cumbria, Lancashire, Cheshire, Merseyside and North Wales have also received training about the SAI&amp;copy; as part of our cross-force dissemination of information about good practice.

Similarly in Norway, where a Norwegian translation of the SAI&amp;copy; has been prepared (known as Selvadministrert Forklaring), information and training concerning the SAI&amp;copy; has been introduced for all police officers at the basic training level and also at more specialist levels. The SAI&amp;copy; currently forms part of the official curriculum for investigative interview training and, to date, approximately 1500 officers have been trained in the SAI&amp;copy;. In Norway, the SAI&amp;copy; is progressing to nation-wide approval and has been identified as &amp;quot;Good Practice&amp;quot; in the investigative interview training curriculum.

Finally, in The Netherlands, the SAI&amp;copy; is available in a Dutch translation, known as the ZeG (Zelfrapportage voor Getuigen). In December 2012, the SAI was approved for national rollout across The Netherlands. Training in the SAI (ZeG) is now a mandatory component of some police training curricula, including 'Crime Scene Management' and 'Criminal Investigations in Comprehensive Cases'. To date, approximately 550 officers have been trained; this number is rapidly increasing.

In the UK, A number of forces are currently evaluating the SAI&amp;copy; while others have established the SAI&amp;copy; as an official force form (e.g. Greater Manchester Police). Other international forces, including forces in Australia, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Germany and Singapore are pursuing integration of the SAI with current training and investigative practice.

To date, the research team have been contacted directly by approximately 30 police forces in the UK and abroad - clearly, there is significant interest in the SAI&amp;copy;. However, the staggered nature of recruitment (due to the responsive mode) has meant that forces have contacted us at very different times and are, therefore, at very different stages of evaluation. For instance, GMP was an early entrant to force trials and has now officially adopted the tool as a force form. As a result, the majority of our Case Studies and evaluations to date have been drawn from GMP.

The majority of the forces who have expressed an interest in the SAI&amp;copy; are currently working on putting procedures in place to embark on within-force evaluations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b6501e3cfe2.35064267-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Small revisions were made to the SAI following suggestions from end-users (the police).

Oslo Police Headquarters, Norway (25 &amp;amp; 26 August, 2010).

Following the workshop about the SAI, a Norwegian translation of the SAI&amp;copy; was developed (known as Selvadministrert Forklaring), 

Furthermore, information and training concerning the SAI&amp;copy; has been introduced for all police officers at the basic training level and also at more specialist levels.

The SAI&amp;copy; currently forms part of the official curriculum for investigative interview training and, to date, over 1500 officers have been trained in the SAI&amp;copy;. 

The SAI&amp;copy; has now received nation-wide approval and has been identified as &amp;quot;Good Practice&amp;quot; in the investigative interview training curriculum.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-239749942.198162852aaa59e6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3140</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Enhancing witness account capture through digital technology</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>CHERISH-de escalator fund</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A50CEAE8-9399-469F-A7A7-E8C971CC1568</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c57125508093.76382330</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our primary output that has had the most significant impact is a scientifically validated recall tool - the Self-Administered Interview. This is an evidence-based investigatory tool that has been tested in controlled laboratory studies, and subsequently in field-tests with real witnesses. The SAI&amp;copy; is now available to UK police forces. 

Our findings and outputs can be seen in an Impact Case Study submitted to REF 2014 (see http://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=44549). This was given the highest rating by the judging panel. In sum, our findings have had an impact upon the following:

Policy-Makers: A Summary Report has been submitted to the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). Support for the SAI&amp;copy; at the ACPO level will ensure a direct impact on policing policy, practice and procedure. 

Police Practitioners: The SAI&amp;copy; is a cost-effective evidence-based scientifically-validated recall tool that enables the police to obtain evidence quickly and efficiently, even when minimal resources are available. It has already been used by witnesses and victims to real crimes in the UK and abroad and secured vital evidence to facilitate investigations. Most recently, the SAI&amp;copy; was used to obtain statements from multiple members of the public who were witness to the terrorist attack in Oslo, Norway (July 2011), in which 77 people were killed.

Societal Level: Obtaining good quality, reliable evidence is vital for the investigation process, the pursuit of justice, and preventing miscarriages of justice. Use of the SAI&amp;copy; in criminal investigations therefore supports the criminal justice system, by providing witnesses and victims with an opportunity to record a high quality statement at minimal delay, in situations where limited resources mean that police officers may not able to interview witnesses immediately.

Other End-Users: The SAI&amp;copy; has been used to obtain evidence in Health &amp;amp; Safety Investigations, including two serious incidents on an off-shore oil-rig.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>18047984-08B9-4700-8A39-A3699DC74170</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>541731f5b40933.01440187</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research has produced a novel recall tool called the 'Self-Administered Interview' (SAI&amp;copy;) that was developed and tested in a controlled lab-based setting, and later field-tested with eyewitnesses to real crimes. The Follow-on-Funding award provided us with the resources necessary to (i) establish, co-ordinate and manage the field-trials and (ii) engage in knowledge-exchange activity with end-users. Our research has produced significant scientific impact in the academic field in the following ways:

a) The project represents a clear (and rare) instance of scientific research progressing from a controlled lab-environment into an applied context. As such our work has attracted significant interest from our academic peers. It has achieved scientific impact by providing researchers with a solid example of the merits of using applied field-based methodology to reach evidence-based conclusions. 

b) Our research findings have advanced empirical understanding of witness memory. Specifically, we have shown that an early recall opportunity can protect against forgetting, and against the negative influences of post-event information.

c) We have directly impacted on the academic community by generating new lines of research. To our knowledge, at least ten research laboratories internationally are now using the SAI&amp;copy; for research purposes to build upon our initial findings. For example, exploring the efficacy of the SAI&amp;copy; in new contexts (accident investigation), and with different populations (older adults). 

In direct recognition of these impacts, Dr. Gabbert was recently awarded an Academic Excellence prize by the International Investigative Interviewing Research Group in recognition of Outstanding Achievements in the area of Investigative Interviewing.

Field trials commenced in January 2010 to establish whether the SAI&amp;copy; can demonstrate practical and evidential benefits to police investigations. Twenty-seven forces (20 from the UK) are currently involved in trials. Feedback from participating forces has been overwhelmingly positive. The SAI&amp;copy; has made an important contribution to a number of live investigations by providing detailed initial accounts, prioritising witnesses, and facilitating the identification of additional witnesses, in incidents including serious road-traffic incidents, assaults, robberies, and including the terrorist attack on Norway in June 2011. In short, the trials have clearly demonstrated that the SAI&amp;copy; can be used simply and efficiently, at low cost, with minimal drain on resources, to obtain high quality information from victims and witnesses.

A Summary Report containing feedback from forces participating in the trials was submitted to The Association of Chief Police Officers in October 2011, 2013, and is currently under review again in 2017. This group may consider officially endorsing the SAI&amp;copy; so that it becomes a recognised procedural response for forces in England and Wales.

The field-trials have also generated interest from charities concerned with the delivery of justice for victims. For instance, RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, are actively campaigning for the SAI&amp;copy; to be standard procedure for obtaining evidence relating to road-traffic-accidents. Victim Support are consulting with local police forces to explore how the SAI&amp;copy; could be used to obtain statements from victims who do not want to press charges at the time of initial disclosure (e.g. domestic abuse).

In sum, our primary output that has had the most significant impact is a scientifically validated recall tool - the Self-Administered Interview. This is an evidence-based investigatory tool that has been tested in controlled laboratory studies, and subsequently in field-tests with real witnesses. The SAI&amp;copy; is available to police forces internationally. It is currently part of standard police policy and procedure in The Netherlands and in Norway. 

To date, we have disseminated our findings at multiple international conferences. Published outputs include not only our own peer reviewed publications (including an invited article), but also publications authored by researchers outwith our team.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The SAI&amp;copy; has been used to obtain evidence in Health and Safety Investigations, including serious incidents on an off-shore oil-rig.

We expect to continue our work on the SAI&amp;copy; for several years to come as novel opportunities for use and development of the tool continue to present themselves.

Our findings have influenced the work of other researchers, who have replicated and extended our findings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D958F2FC-B794-48E9-8FAC-371F678E8530</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5417347508ad64.00896833</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.selfadministeredinterview.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Academic Advisor on the College of Policing's Investigative Interviewing Guideline Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>26C82B39-75BE-4259-848F-0065145D8BB0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c56fbd541852.91090363</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Changes to Investigative Interviewing Policy and Practice overseas</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>81195A39-940C-494F-B38D-BE8C490E1CE1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The SAI&amp;copy; has now been translated into a number of languages at the request of international police forces. Some examples of how the SAI&amp;copy; has changed policy and practice of investigative interviews follow.

Norway: The Norwegian translation of the SAI&amp;copy; is the Selvadministrert Forklaring. Information and training concerning the SAI&amp;copy; has been
introduced for all Norwegian police officers at the basic training level, as well as at more specialist levels.

The Netherlands: The Dutch translation of the SAI&amp;copy; is the Zelfrapportage voor Getuigen (ZeG). In December 2012, the SAI&amp;copy; was approved for national rollout across The Netherlands. Training in the ZeG is now a mandatory component of police training curricula, including 'Crime Scene Management' and 'Criminal Investigations in Comprehensive Cases'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545ba7d5a08452.21298975</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Changes to Investigative Interviewing Policy and Practice in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>88F66411-AE42-41ED-BC50-3514A6755288</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To attract the attention of UK police forces an extensive knowledge-exchange strategy with end-users was implemented, which included disseminating findings at practitioner conferences, in practitioner magazines, and by creating and promoting a website (www.selfadministeredinterview.com). Twenty-seven forces (20 from the UK) are currently involved in the field trials, which commenced in January 2010. 

Field trials with police forces have proven the SAI&amp;copy; can facilitate an investigation by obtaining critical information quickly and effectively. In particular, the SAI&amp;copy; has made an important contribution to a number of live investigations by providing detailed initial accounts, prioritising witnesses, and facilitating the identification of additional witnesses. 

Feedback from forces has been overwhelmingly positive. A quote from an end-user highlights the real-world impact of this research: &amp;quot;Notably, the SAI is the first empirically-derived interviewing practice development that has been presented to the police in almost 20 years, probably the most valuable additional tool placed at our disposal in the world of investigative interviewing since the adoption of the 'PEACE' model of interviewing in the early 1990s, and the introduction of the enhanced cognitive interview model.&amp;quot; (Ian Hynes, Force Specialist Investigative Interview Manager and Advisor, Greater Manchester Police, UK). 

The SAI&amp;copy; has been accepted in court on a few occasions now. For example, In December 2011, Greater Manchester Police reported on the successful prosecution of a case of violent assault where the SAI&amp;copy; played a central role as part of the investigative interviewing strategy. Use of the SAI&amp;copy; was addressed in Court and challenged by the defense. However, on presentation of information concerning the SAI&amp;copy;, all challenges were abandoned and the rationale for use of the SAI&amp;copy; in the case was fully accepted by the Court.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545ba3ee244c66.90509089</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or
