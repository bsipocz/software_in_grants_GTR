These 10-day meetings have run since 1974 and have quickly developed their highest international reputation. They are widely associated with the excellence of British mathematics. The programme activity of the Durham Symposia is fully controlled by the London Mathematical Society, and takes place during the summer period, fitting well into the academic diary of mathematicians worldwide.

This proposal seeks support for a continuation of the programme of Symposia for a further four years.

The Symposia bring together the top UK and international researchers, with the aim of finding common ground and discussing exciting recent developments. Nearly all participants reside in the same accommodation block, giving the meetings a closed and informal atmosphere under which the exchange of ideas and cross-fertilization of research expertise can flourish.

Information on each symposium can be found through the actively-managed and easily accessible website (http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/events/Meetings/LMS/), which contains links to all previous Durham Symposia. The main talks of each symposium are recorded (with permission of the speakers) and made available through this website within days after the end of the meeting. Similarly, lecture notes and presentation slides are also made available.

The outcomes from the symposia impart a large impetus to already dynamic research areas. The UK and international symposium participants are the immediate beneficiaries, but the timely appearance of videos and lecture notes on the Durham Symposium website also informs the research of many other mathematical scientists working in the area. This in turn adds considerably to our understanding of the various research topics studied.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of the current proposal is to continue to provide a framework for the mathematical community of the UK to hold conferences at the highest international standard which can set the research agenda in the field for the next five to ten years. The themes for the Durham Symposia have and will continue to cover almost all areas in the EPSRC portfolio for Mathematical Sciences. As the topics for the coming symposia are not yet decided, it is difficult to predict potential beneficiaries of the impact. Nevertheless, in recent years there have been several symposia with participants from industry and national agencies such as the Met Office, and this is expected to continue in the future.

Communication and enagement - Once a symposium has been been approved by the RMC, it is advertised in the newsletter of the LMS and various websites used for advertising conferences. An important part of the communication is then taking place through the Durham Symposia website. The team has developed a highly interactive webtool, which enables organisers and participants to easily stay up to date. The link to the Durham Symposia website is publicised regularly in the LMS newsletter, and also easily accessible through the webpages of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Durham University.

Collaboration and exploitation - Each symposium brings together many of the leading experts in the given field, both from the UK and abroad. Organisers are encouraged to leave a lot of time for discussions. Most participants stay at the same resident college, where full internet access is available. Together with the typical length of up to ten days for a symposium this provides a very fertile ground for collaborations among participants.

The Durham Symposia website collects a wealth of information from each symposium. Since 2004 almost all talks have been filmed and the files are made available on the web. Speakers are also asked to make presentations in pdf or ppt files available on our website. The collection of data represents a rich repository that it is widely used throughout the world. As the website is openly accessible, researchers who have not been able to participate in a symposium can still obtain a lot of information that way.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>629651</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Geometric and Algebraic Aspects of Integrability</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA44564C-47E1-4F6E-BC5C-27D3A9D94987</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The activity was the 105th EPSRC-LMS Durham Symposium. It focussed on Integrability, which has been an important mathematical concept since the 19th century. The modern theory is grew up around the study of KdV type equations, following the discovery of multi-soliton solutions, infinite number of conservation laws and the Inverse Scattering Transform in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s new ideas came via integrable field theories and connections with harmonic maps and differential geometry were re-established. Links with other areas of mathematics - algebraic geometry, twistor theory, self-duality, representation theory, number theory, enumerative geometry, Gromov-Witten theory and Topological Quantum Field Theories grew in the 1990s and through into the 21st Century.
The aim of the Symposium was to bring together leading international researchers in the various sub-fields of integrable systems, concentrating primarily on the mathematical aspects of the theory.
Considerable progress in these areas is to be expected from the participants of the symposium.

This symposium explored the mathematical problems associated with Maxwell's equations in several modern application areas. These main areas are 
1) Photonics and Resonances: This looks at the propagation of electromagnetic waves in periodic structures. Mathematical questions include the study of affects on the spectrum of the underlying operator resulting from the geometry or strength of perturbations to the periodic structure.
2) Metamaterials and Cloaking: Metamaterials are usually constructed by using repeated microscopic structures to achieve properties not observed in natural materials. These properties are usually achieved in some abnormal regimes, which can only be approximated in actual production processes. This provides difficult mathematical problems, such as analysing the rate of convergence of various approximations and defining the optimal way to approximate. Mathematical techniques include homogenization theory.
3) Inverse Problems in Electromagnetism: Many (medical) imaging techniques make use of electromagnetic waves. Recently, there has been much interest in so called mixed mode or hybrid imaging. Mathematical questions include: unique reconstruction of the image, development of reconstruction algorithms and reconstruction in the presence of incomplete data. One tool used successfully in this area has been harmonic analysis.
Considerable progress in these areas is to be expected from the participants of the symposium.

EPSRC-LMS Durham Symposium. This Symposium explored the connections between several topics of high recent activity: homogeneous structures in model theory and their automorphism groups, and connections to topological dynamics,
structural Ramsey theory, and constraint satisfaction; homomorphisms of relational structures, transformation semigroups, and synchronization; different approaches to random graph theory, through graphons and through exchangeable measures; and recent advances in computational algebra, with possible applications for transformation semigroups. The symposium combined a series of short courses, stand-alone lectures, and time for discussion.
