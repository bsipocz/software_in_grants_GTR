If anything goes wrong during this process, chromosomes may be lost or gained. If this happens, further cell divisions will be impaired, leading to cell death or initiating cancer development. Indeed, unequal segregation of the genetic material, a condition called aneuploidy, is considered a hallmark as well as a driving force of cancer. My research team at the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Oxford will analyse the regulatory mechanisms that ensure the reliability of chromosome segregation in mammalian cells. For this work we will use human tumor cells grown in tissue culture. When cells divide a molecular chromosome division machinery, the mitotic spindle, is build inside the cell out of minute building blocks called microtubules. These form strings that the chromosomes attach to. Once properly attached, the chromosomes are pulled into the daughter cells. Stable attachment of the chromosomes to the microtubules is critical, since faulty attachments may result in chromosomes getting lost. There is a cellular control machinery termed the &amp;quot;spindle assembly checkpoint&amp;quot; that checks that all the chromosomes are properly attached to microtubules before the chromosomes are divided but sometimes this safeguard fails. We are interested in understanding the different aspects that contribute to the faithfulness of chromosome segregation. How is the formation of the mitotic spindle regulated? How do the chromosomes attach to the microtubules? How is this controlled? How does the spindle assembly checkpoint function? We will identify molecules that contribute to both the attachment process and the control mechanisms and analyse how these are regulated. One common form of regulation in cells is the attachment of distinct small chemical tags to molecules that do specific jobs. We are particularly interested in tags called &amp;quot;phosphorylations&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;acetylations&amp;quot;. These tags alter the function of the molecule they have been attached to, e.g. switch it on or off or change its interaction with other proteins. We believe that the cellular machines, the enzymes, that add, remove and control the levels of these small tags are critical for the correct functioning of cell division and one of our goals is to define which regulator controls which tag and when. Our work will help to unravel the control mechanisms that ensure correct distribution of the chromosomes and thus prevent aneuploidy. This knowledge will enable us to devise novel and better therapeutic approaches to cancer and further our understanding of other conditions where the chromosomes are not distributed correctly, e.g. birth defects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim of my lab's research is to understand the mechanics and regulation of cell division and chromosome segregation. Aneuploidy, the condition where chromosomes are either lost or gained, is a consequence of faulty chromosome segregation and is considered both a hallmark and a driving force for tumorigenesis. A better appreciation of the processes ensuring accurate chromosome segregation may therefore lead to novel therapeutic approaches for cancer. While many molecular players contributing to the formation of the mitotic spindle and kinetochores have been identified, the precise biochemical activities of these components and how they are dynamically regulated throughout mitosis is often not understood. Our goal is to integrate the identification of components contributing to mitotic progression with the characterization of their biological function, exemplified by our recent identification of the astrin-kinastrin spindle and kinetochore complex as a novel microtubule plus-end tracking activity. In addition, we are interested in the control of mitosis by post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Many enzymes involved in the dynamic regulation of these PTMs remain still to be discovered as highlighted by our recent identification of the PP6 phosphatase as the mitotic T-loop phosphatase for the Aurora A kinase. We now propose to study three related areas critical for chromosome segregation: 1.) The regulation of spindle formation and chromosome segregation by mitotic phosphatases, 2.) The regulation of stable microtubule kinetochore attachment formation by microtubule plus-end tracking complexes and post-translational modifications and 3.) The regulation of mitotic progression by reversible acetylation. To address these research themes we will use a combination of biochemical and cell biological techniques, using both cutting edge mass spectrometry and imaging techniques as well as classical biochemical approaches.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit: Since our research is concerned with the basis of cell division our work will benefit a large number of academic and non-academic scientists working on different aspects of cell cycle research or on any research area involving cell division. In addition, the results of our work may be informative for companies interested in developing drugs aimed at poisoning mitosis, e.g. for use as chemotherapeutics in the treatment of tumourigenic malignancies. Our work also presents a value in itself since we use a range of highly specialized cell biological and biochemical techniques that are passed on to the researchers joining the lab. Undergraduate and postgraduate researchers in the lab thus acquire highly useful skills that make them attractive assets to other labs and companies. 
How will they benefit: The objectives of the proposed work will directly inform other researchers studying related areas. Novel intellectual property will be created with academic and potentially commercial value. Researchers trained in my laboratory will be able to continue their own academic careers or obtain desirable positions elsewhere when they leave my lab thus benefitting themselves and the British economy. Our research may also directly feed into novel drug developments by pharmaceutical companies. The most likely area of Research and Development that will benefit from our research is Cancer Research. Cancer is one of the major diseases affecting people's life expectancy and quality of life. In the UK cancer accounted for more than a quarter (27%) of all deaths in 2008. Although, potent chemotherapeutics are available, many have severe side effects, or lose efficacy after some time of treatment. Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division and unfaithful division of the genetic material. Our work into the regulation of cell cycle progression and the maintenance of genomic integrity may thus lead to novel insights into how cell cycle progression differs between tumor and normal cells and how cancer cells may best be attacked without harming the rest of the organism. One work package of the proposed research is specifically designed to gain new insights into the mechanisms of the spindle assembly checkpoint, a major cellular target of antimitotic chemotherapeutics. Our research may thus help to design more efficient antimitotic agents.
Timescale of our impacts: We aim to publish the first results of our studies in the first 2-3 years of the grant with other publications following later into the grant. Training of researchers will continue throughout the grant and the impact of this training will live on past the duration of the grant. Novel intellectual property will be created throughout the duration of the grant and may create impact well beyond the duration of the grant.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2521944</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Biochemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>Systems-level characterization of mammalian cell cycle transitions</gtr:description><gtr:id>A381F001-4D8A-4DCE-91DF-B8344C26E8DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Successful BBSRC LoLa grant application.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544117442762a5.64965233-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Computational modelling of the metaphase to anaphase transition.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Analysis of the metaphase to anaphase transition by biochemical methods.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Analysis of mitotic phosphatases</gtr:description><gtr:id>5B53F5D5-50E1-4BA9-9AE4-8EB3FE4397F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Espert, A., Uluocak, P., Nunes Bastos, R., Mangat, D., Graab, P. and Gruneberg, U.
