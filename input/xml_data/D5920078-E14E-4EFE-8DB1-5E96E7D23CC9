In 2012 more Africans will have access to mobile communication services than improved water services. Africa's rapid growth in mobile handset ownership and mobile network coverage can provide a key platform to resolve one of its oldest problems - safe and reliable water access. This project will work with the Government of Zambia and UNICEF to examine how a new technology developed by Oxford University that automatically texts information on handpump use can improve reliable access to water services for the rural poor. Our research aims to understand how the availability of objective and reliable information on handpump performance will influence the relationship between Africa?s ?new mobile citizens?, communities, government and donors to accelerate and maintain improved water services, and to evaluate social and economic outcomes for the rural poor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will generate technical data on handpump performance, and interview and survey rural water users. Workshops and interviews will be held with government, NGOs and donors. Findings will be published on a project website including open-access reports and academic papers. Local and international media will share the findings and implications to increase awareness and uptake.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
The primary beneficiaries will be a) rural water users in Zambia, b) the Government of Zambia, c) donors/investors. First, rural water users will benefit directly from a free, one-year maintenance service pilot reaching an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 water users served by 200 sampled handpumps in rural Zambia. Second, the Government of Zambia and Ministry of Local Government and Housing (MLGH) responsible for national rural water supply will benefit from capturing and understanding data on the performance of handpumps in real-time to i) shape planning and investment decisions to reach the most in need in an accountable and transparent way, ii) have empirical data on operational performance and costs to develop a national rural water maintenance programme, iii) be in a position to monitor and hold to account donor investments in handpumps over the life-time of pumps, iv) crowd-in investment from potential investors who are underwhelmed by the lack of metrics on investment returns compared to other interventions (i.e. health, education), v) be in position to maintain and accelerate improved water services to Zambia's 8.3 million rural inhabitants, of which 4.4 million lack safe water supply. Third, donors/investors will benefit by understanding the performance of their investment in rural water supply and be able to monitor and target investments of the full life-time of a handpump learning how and who uses the handpump to improve effectiveness and ancillary interventions, such as maintenance services, water quality testing, hygiene education and water supply to rural schools. Naturally, if the project achieves its goals this work will have potentially dramatic implications across all rural areas in developing regions where 84% of the 884 million people without safe water access live. UNICEF is uniquely placed to effectively scale-up and leverage change across the 193 countries where they operate.

How will they benefit?
As discussed in detail elsewhere, the time-savings, health, education, income and dignity benefits for rural water users will be large and significant. Equally, the distributional impacts will particularly favour women and children, and other vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, single-female headed households and child-headed households. The latter are a particular concern due to the impact of HIV/AIDS in rural Zambia.

The opportunity to benefit?
The pathways to impact document answers this question, though it can be re-emphasized that working with MLGH and UNICEF positions the project centrally with key policy and donor decision-makers in the rural water sector in Zambia and globally. Further, the project will invite other known NGOs working in the sector to learn from the project though we have a clear purpose to work with government and not outside it for sustainability and impact. In addition, the project has an ongoing dialogue with Airtel and other major mobile network operators to support other mechanisms to communicate and catalyse this work in Zambia and beyond.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>420278</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A team from Oxford University has developed a new technology to remotely monitor the use and functionality of handpumps in rural Africa.

The average number of repairs over 18 month was 3.5 per pump that had a repair (or 3.0 for all pumps being maintained as not all pumps required a repair during the study period). Looking at the local variable costs (mechanic wages, transport, spares and data costs) against the volume of water pumps as determined by the Waterpoint Data Transmitters (a.k.a. Smart Handpumps) the median cost per m3 of water was Ksh 10, with a 95th percentile cost of Ksh 49 (around $0.50). This is around half the cost that many people are prepared to pay for water.

The micro-enterprise that has be running the repair service was set up and is now incorporated in Kenya (Kwale Handpumps Ltd.). The manager and two mechanics are being trained and mentored by the project team and are now signing up communities to a paid maintenance service.

Average usage was 9,500 litres per week, with seven pumps seeing over 30,000 litres pumped per week, the highest being 48,000 litres. There was also high spatial and temporal variability in water use. Early 2014 was extremely dry, making handpumps vital: immediately before the first rains one pump was being used 24 hours per day, averaging over 16,000 litres per day for the 30 days prior to the rains. 

A major package of work for the grant was the household survey conducted in the Kwale study area (n=3,401). Conducted by a locally recruited enumerator team of 18 people, and trained by the project team, this survey covered water use, poverty and health data.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the data, looking at four poverty metrics in terms of their usefulness in elucidating the extent and multidimensional nature of poverty in Kwale: (a) Absolute [food basket]; (b) Relative [USD1.25 day]; (c) Multi-dimensional welfare index; (d) Subjective welfare. We constructed a multi-dimensional welfare index with 27 indicators (education, dwelling, assets, drinking water, sanitation and health) which provide a good statistical fit.

Household survey dated show high levels of mobile phone ownership (84%) and mobile money use (69%), with extremely penetration across all groups other than the lowest 20%. It is also clear that in terms of mobile money provision, M-Pesa has a near monopoly (67%). This indicates that water users in Kwale County have the ability to engage with a mobile-communication based maintenance service, including making payments via mobile money.

With respect to water supply, higher welfare households were 4.4 times more likely to have three or more of four subjective measures of drinking water security (quality, quantity, reliability and affordability) compared to lower welfare households; in contrast the difference was 1.3 times when applied to the cruder measure of &amp;quot;improved&amp;quot; water access. This underlines the known limitations of measuring 'access' (the physical handpump) alone rather than examining service delivery by the multiple criteria recognised under the Human Right to Water (UN 2010).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are three aspects of this research which will be useful to other researchers, policy-makers and stakeholders:

Firstly, technology and data can provide new information that can be extremely useful for both research and operational deployment. While a handful of transmitters were damaged, the majority are still working two years after installation (time of writing this report) generating data on handpump usage are functionality.

Secondly, the insights into the temporal and special variability of pump usage are unique. Such understanding of spatial variation in water usage patterns can help inform decisions about future water supply investments, targeting them in areas of high demand, rather than making them based on broad assumptions on per-capita water use and census data. 

Finally, the professional and rapid maintenance service demonstrated that it is possible to repair handpumps very quickly and at low cost. 95% of communities receiving the service paid around half the cost per litre that many people are prepared to pay for water. While it should be noted that these calculations did not us the full programme fixed cost as this was a research programme, this shows that supra-community management is a viable option for rural water supply.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E081BA66-2B66-4AF5-A34D-65AB0B6DC923</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c4cf494cde85.45140055</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research-programmes/water-programme/publications.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Article in The Economist (4 March 2017) on FundiFix model</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D6C7FC17-E397-471F-932D-BAD2956489AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21717766-innovative-cure-broken-pumps-better-way-provide-drinking-water</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7bc5f7d41b3.32979259</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21717766-innovative-cure-broken-pumps-better-way-provide-drinking-water</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Government of Kenya Water Services Regulatory Annual Report 2014</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12EA6332-1163-4640-BEFE-6394C628AABF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New model for rural water sustainability that benefits low-income and marginalised rural populations in Kenya gain more reliable water services.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546cd50ce33186.79791943</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.wasreb.go.ke/impact-reports</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Comprehensive waterpoint mapping data set for 534 handpumps situated in Kwale County (Msambweni &amp;amp; Matuge districts) incorporating a range of variables, including:
