The collaboration is informed by the AHRC's highlight notice 'Cross-Disciplinary Research Networks Exploring Emerging Areas of Cross-Council Enquiry' and focuses on the AHRC highlighted areas of well-being and mental health. 
Whilst EDs in females (e.g. anorexia, bulimia) are being explored fairly extensively in medical and cultural approaches, there is significantly less engagement with male EDs in general and male AN in particular. Despite being perceived as a 'female-only-problem', ED-charities suggest that male AN is an increasing problem in Western countries and highlight the need for greater awareness and more research. The relationship between human beings and food is highly complex and affects many aspects of life, involving biological, psychological, economic, social and cultural factors. This stresses the need for a wider and cross-disciplinary engagement that also takes questions of gender into account. All this makes our proposal timely and highly relevant and emphasizes its potential to stimulate innovative research. 
Our network of international UK- and US-based investigators facilitates significant boundary-crossing exchange between medicine, psychiatry, mental health science, education, english, modern foreign languages, linguistics and mathematics to develop a joint research agenda. We also collaborate closely with named partners from 4 ED-charities in our research and impact activities (educational events with schools and UG students, a workshop with teachers, student training events). Our project has significant potential to impact on individuals, health and educational professionals, the wider public and policy-making and for future collaborative work across the disciplines. It is situated in the emerging discipline of health humanities that provides a platform for linking health disciplines with the arts &amp;amp; humanities encouraging innovative applications of the latter to improve the well-being of individuals and societies. It is also informed by the interdisciplinary work of Nottingham's Institute of Mental Health. 
At the heart of our network is the desire for further research on, and to raise awareness of, male AN. It explores aspects of male AN in the UK and draws comparisons with North America, Germany, France and Italy in 3 areas of personal narrative: literature (fiction and autobiographical writings), online egodocuments (personal accounts in weblogs and forums), and oral accounts (client-led oral communication in a wider therapy context). Whilst participating researchers from academic institutions bring a distinct arts &amp;amp; humanities perspective to these 3 areas, the proposed key activities are not primarily designed to advance individual disciplines but to spark new conversations with participating scholars from medical and health care sciences. The project facilitates comparisons across different areas and explores how personal narratives can add to the understanding of male AN in a medical and healthcare context. Developing a joint research agenda has the potential to inform and transform the treatment and management of male AN framed by cross-disciplinary research questions:
How can personal narratives of male EDs delivered in literature, online egodocuments and client-led oral accounts
- help males with AN in an innovative manner?
- aid and inform their treatment beyond established medical definitions and paradigms of socio-culturally constructed concepts of disorder and gendered behaviour? 
- be used in educating and training health care professionals?
- contribute to greater public knowledge, awareness and understanding? 
How, in turn, can insights from healthcare professionals aid to the understanding of these 3 types of personal narratives?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network activities will benefit the following 6 groups:

Group 1: School pupils from secondary schools
The age group identified by researchers as most vulnerable regarding EDs is early- to mid-adolescence. By holding interactive educational events tailor-made for this age group of boys and girls we will contribute to their education and awareness regarding healthy eating behaviour, (over-)exercising, EDs in general and AN in particular. Sessions are aimed to show pathways to positive body image and building self esteem thus contributing to their well-being and quality of life. In separate informal groups led by a trained male ED-charity facilitator, boys in particular will benefit from an approach that breaks down concepts of AN as a 'female-only' problem and encourages them to voice any issues they may have. All pupils will benefit from personally coming to know charity-workers, some from the local area, who can provide confidential help and support beyond this event and equip them with useful further information and addresses. An additional benefit is that we encourage young people to a campus visit who may not have visited a university otherwise potentially leading to their social, educational and cultural benefits.

Group 2: Male undergraduates
Another group recognized as vulnerable for EDs is students, particularly in their first year when facing significant life changes. Young men from this group will benefit from our expert-led tailor-made workshops addressing specifically male EDs and AN in the new environment of a university. Other benefits regarding their education, awareness beyond gendered concepts, self esteem, body image, quality of life and well-being are comparable to group 1. They also benefit from being introduced to specific support networks for students: students' counselling and support services and, at UoN, the newly established 'EDs and Students Service' in addition to local charities off campus. 

Group 3: Teachers and school staff (e.g. nurses)
They will benefit by increasing their knowledge and awareness of male AN in boys and by discussing best practice and integration of the topic into teaching activities. Their recommendations, ideas and concerns will be communicated to policy-makers attending the final symposium with a view to feeding EDs and male AN into the National Curriculum.

Group 4: Health and Educational Professionals (in training) 
Through 2 training sessions with students in Medicine, Nursing, Psychology, Education and other relevant disciplines the project has the potential to influence the training and approach of future health professionals. Students will benefit from specialist sessions (by First Steps ED-charity, participants, PI and CoI Micali leading UCL's MSc in EDs) on problems and perspectives of recognising and treating male AN. They will benefit further from learning about the importance of cross-disciplinarity and how arts &amp;amp; humanities knowledge and practice (e.g. regarding personal narratives) can enhance well-being and mental health. In addition, opportunities for exchange with other students on different programmes will broaden their horizon helping them to become reflective practitioners. 

Group 5: Members of the public
Through dissemination of the network's activities in the media and on the website the wider public will benefit from raised awareness for male AN, potentially leading to more caring open-minded communities equipped with information how to seek help and support for themselves and others. 

Group 6: Policy-makers
The network has the potential to inform and transform policy-making on mental health and EDs in general and male AN in particular by engaging in exchange with government representative and NHS spokespersons during our final symposium and presenting to them at relevant national and international conferences. More awareness regarding male AN, e.g. mirrored in an update of the 2004 NICE guidelines will be of public benefit.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37804</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop: Literary Representation of Anorexia Nervosa</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7F46DE67-E004-4401-A31F-B82034E8A39B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During this workshop (19th -20th July 2016 at The University of Nottingham) a team of 12 international academics, including literary scholars from English and foreign languages (French, Italian, German), 1 linguist, 1 medical professional (Co-I Prof. Nadia Micali), 1 psychoanalyst, 1 mathematician and 1 author, explored representations of anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders in males and females in literary writings (fiction, poetry, autobiographical writings et al) from 18th C to the present day. Talks by expert speakers (Dr Francesca Calamita, University of Virginia; Dr Katie Jones , University of St Andrews; Dr Petra Bagley, University of Central Lancashire; Dr Kathryn Robson, University of Newcastle; Dr Heike Bartel (PI), University of Nottingham; Prof. Elizabeth Boa, University of Nottingham) and a reading by author Ulrike Draesner from her novel 'Mitgift' (2002) sparked questions and responses about a cultural, aesthetic and historical framework for the under-researched field of 'narratives of male anorexia'. Literature depicting representations of anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders in females was used as a point of comparison and introduced by the editors (Calamita, Bagley and Robson) of a forthcoming volume presenting innovative angles on representations of anorexia and bulimia in post-1968 European women's writing (Peter Lang, expected 2017 for their series &amp;quot;Studies in Contemporary Women's Writing&amp;quot;).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c7ac9a65f9.43066166</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Health Humanities Conference, Seville 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DD26E84-0395-4784-AC9F-64A8EF880EFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PI Heike Bartel delivered a talk at the 2017 International Health Humanities Conference: Arts &amp;amp; Humanities for Improving Social Inclusion, Education and Health: Creative Practice and Mutuality: 'Literary Representations of Anorexia Nervosa in Males'.

This conference was a very good platform to disseminate research, exchange views with a broad range of international experts and practitioners and has led to useful further contacts and collaborations with academics, e.g. Steven C.

This day for schools held on 26.1.2017 on The University of Nottingham's Jubilee campus (10 am-2:30 pm) was very successful and attracted 72 pupils (mainly year 11 and 12) and teachers from 6 schools in the East Midlands area.
The event aimed to encourage an open forum for students to learn about self-esteem and self-confidence, how to cope with challenges such as eating disorders, Obsessive Compulsive Behaviour, (cyber)bullying and stress. 

We started in the morning with a plenary session on 'Self Esteem' delivered by Jenny Langley, followed by workshops on Boys and 'Body Image' (Marc Thrasivoulou); 'Girls, Body and Self -Esteem' (Jenny Langley); Cyberbullying (Sam Marks). All three workshop leaders are working for / associated with charities that are closely linked to the topic and could give expert advice: Jenny Langley is founder of BOYANOREXIA (http://www.boyanorexia.com/ a registered Eating Disorders (EDs) charity dealing particularly with boys), author of Boys Get Eating Disorders Too (2006), associate trainer in educating about and raising awareness for anorexia in young males for the reg. EDs charity B-eat (https://b-eat.co.uk/). She is also associate trainer for the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust, working for young people's mental well-being, and associate of the EDs research team of the Institute of Psychiatry. She is also mother to a son who overcame anorexia nervosa. Marc Thrasivoulou is a Sport and Exercise Science Graduate and a qualified Personal Trainer, who has been working at the registered EDs Charity First Steps (http://firststepsderbyshire.co.uk/) for the past 9 years, in a variety of roles and capacities. Marc's main expertise is in the area of Compulsive Exercise and EDs. He has personal experience of an eating disorder, and has facilitated the Loughborough Eating-Disorder Activity Therapy project for those struggling with compulsive exercise. He is able to offer a Practical Exercise Service to those struggling with Compulsive Exercise and Physical Inactivity. Samantha Marks is a trainer for Kidscape, an anti-bullying charity founded in 1985, who equip young people, parents and professionals with the skills to tackle bullying and safeguarding issues across the UK. Samantha has been working in the charity and youth sector for the last ten years and is passionate making sure young people's voices are heard and listened to and that adults working with young people understand how to create safe environments and fulfil their safeguarding duties while also looking after themselves. 

After the morning workshops students had lunch with our undergraduate ambassadors who reported great interest in the topics and good interaction between students. Over lunch with teachers the AHRC research team discussed further activities with schools and they all agreed that follow-up visits by trainers from local charities with related focus would be most useful to train and educate students, student ambassadors and, importantly, teachers further. With the additional money of &amp;pound;3000 we secured from CLAS for further impact we are planning to arrange a number of such visits. We will also look into further activities such as 'teachers' packs' and GP leaflets.

In the afternoon students could choose from four arts and humanities based workshops:
Elvira Perez: Flamenco-Yoga Workshop. Elvira Perez is a yoga instructor and led a fun and active workshop that could be enjoyed by all. This workshop gave students some ideas as how to deal with stress through movement and breathing combining relaxing and slow elements of Kundalini Yoga with energetic elements of Flamenco dancing. Originally, Flamenco dancing was the only way repressed groups in Southern Spain such as Romani Gypsies, Muslims and Jews were allowed to express themselves, voice anger, fear, power and desire (perhaps a bit like Rap or Hip-hop in our days?). So it is a great tool to show people how to express themselves and tell their 'stories'.
Danielle Mills: Not all therapists have two legs! What can we learn through interaction with animals? How can animals help us pick up and deal with problems we may be having: stress, loneliness, issues with self-confidence and self-esteem. How can they teach us important skills like non-verbal communication, compassion, assertiveness, creative thinking, problem-solving, leadership, teamwork, relationship skills, confidence and resilience? Danielle Mills is a qualified counselor who has set up Pony Partnerships (http://www.ponypartnerships.com/) specializing in Equine Therapy. Her hands-on workshop addressed some of these questions with the help of her therapy dog.
Dawn Bowden: Drama Workshop. How can we use Drama to better understand the things that might affect us and our peers, now or in the future? This workshop by Dawn Bowden (www.dawnbowden.co.uk) explored what it is like to experience stress through the creation of a character. Having considered the character students then creatively expressed how they might support her or him to develop both Coping Strategies and Resilience. 
Heike Bartel: Creative Writing Workshop: Change Your Perspective. Stories allow us to experience what it is like to be in another person's skin or to tell stories about ourselves but from a distance and with the freedom to 'change the script'. Heike Bartel delivered a creative writing workshop where students could explore different perspectives: How do we see other people? How do we see ourselves? How do we pick up signs how someone is feeling? How can writing or telling stories help us becoming aware of problems surrounding us and our own perspective on things? Students particularly enjoyed meeting Danielle Mills' registered therapy-dog who was on site the whole day and helped to 'staff' the safe room, an area where students could withdraw to if they needed a break from the programme. 

Feedback we collected (via clicker) at the beginning and end of the day clearly indicated that students' understanding and knowledge of the topic had improved significantly throughout the event. 
Question 1:'How clearly do you understand the impact that confidence and self-esteem has on mental health?' was answered after the event as follows: Very clearly 58% (24% at start); clearly 35% (42% at start); not very clearly 7% (34% at start).
Question 2: How clearly do you understand how to increase your confidence and self-esteem?' was answered after the event as follows: Very clearly 36% (8% at start); clearly 51% (22% at start); not very clearly 13% (70% at start).
Question 3: 'How knowledgeable are you about eating disorders and boys?' was answered after the event as follows: Very knowledgeable 42% (10% at start); reasonably knowledgeable 51% (34% at start); not very knowledgeable 7% (56% at start).

Open anonymous feedback delivered good anecdotal evidence of positive impact and 100% of comments said that this event was useful and they would recommend it for other young people. The day clearly raised awareness and sparked discussion, and teachers reported follow-up discussions and increased interested in the topics discussed after the event. We are currently planning with teachers and students our follow-up activities in schools in the region (school visits by trainers from local EDs and mental health charities).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bc5dc173a958.01110125</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/clas/about/news-and-events/events/hungry-for-words-self-confidence.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>CLAS Impact Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Nottingham</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E18FEF5E-3209-4C34-8D13-77995BC894DA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bc4902549354.63625346</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2FB9CE50-3BEF-43E7-BFC6-C415750674F2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Accessing Online Data for Youth Mental Health Research: Meeting the Ethical Challenges</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophy &amp; Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/72fac48e46f9f73ad0b65b0e9985fdca"><gtr:id>72fac48e46f9f73ad0b65b0e9985fdca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Perez Vallejos E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a844b75859bc6.88559307</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A16148C-6CED-41EE-8577-D9800FF7DA8D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impact of creative workshops for people with severe mental health problems: art as a means of recovery</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Arts &amp; Health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4d8189f01b5ded7cd801a408f66b9b6b"><gtr:id>4d8189f01b5ded7cd801a408f66b9b6b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Saavedra J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a844cd4c892a0.36342485</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>12DFE695-1012-4FB6-B33D-A17616323978</gtr:id><gtr:title>What is home?
