&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Getting students to generate and interpret their own quantitative survey data on substantive topics. New data about the students themselves follows the question wording found in national surveys. Students also use national and international data. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>The project also trains faculty to deal with QM teaching.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>It publicises useful Online Education Resources (OERs). &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The project is delivered partly by staff in the UK Data Service and in MIMAS, the national data delivery and support service. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries of the project are the social science undergraduate teachers who participate in our programme of activities and their students. For the teachers, the impact will primarily be in terms of the incorporation of a wider range of teaching materials, methodologies and supporting evidence in relation to their substantive module topic. A potential secondary impact on this group is an increased confidence in their ability to teach and draw upon quantitative methods, data sources and evidence, and also an increased likelihood in the use of such methods in their own research; as teaching quantitative methods should enable greater confidence in the use of such methodologies in research. For students, the project will develop their skills base by improving statistical literacy, and by increasing their ability to recognise difficulties of interpretation, based upon the underlying social and political complexity and social diversity. This is likely to have a large impact on their employability and future careers.

This project could also have a wider impact on the following groups:
1) The project will help the Royal Statistical Society's getstats program by increasing the statistical literacy of a large number of undergraduate social science students at Manchester (from year 1 onwards) and other universities which participate in the project. 
2) Employers in the public and private sectors will benefit from a better skilled graduate workforce that is statistically literate, and familiar with quantitative analysis. One of the direct outcomes of the project is the students' ability to download and assess data from UK, EU and other international datasets, which could be of immense help in assessing evidence and making decisions for local authorities, government agencies, charities, and marketing organisations who constitute a large section of employers of Manchester social science undergraduates. 
3) Directors of postgraduate taught and research programmes in the social sciences will benefit from a statistically literate graduate population interested in pursuing postgraduate education. The project could increase the range of methodologies adopted in Masters and PhD dissertations, and could also have an impact on the quality of Advanced Quantitative Methods studentship applications to the North-West ESRC Doctoral Training Centre. 
4) The project will also have an impact on ESDS government and ESDS international (our partners in the delivery of the project) by making their materials and datasets more widely used. Wider dissemination of their activities and outputs is one of their key aims. At present, these groups have strong connections with social science postgraduates, but rather weaker links with social science undergraduates (with some notable exceptions among undergraduate economists who use ESDS international resources). The project embeds their resources, trainers and outputs directly into the social science undergraduate curriculum.
5) Members of learned Societies such as the British Sociological Association, Royal Statistical Society, and the Political Studies Association and participants in their annual conferences will be able to benefit from our presentations to these groups.
6) Legacy arrangements of training materials and courses with the Centre for Census and Survey Research (CCSR) will enable CCSR to be a world class trainer not only of quantitative methods but of quantitative methods teaching as well. Furthermore, such legacy arrangements with CCSR will provide ongoing training activities for future social science undergraduate teachers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80315</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop for Teachers of Quantitative Methods in Sociology and Social Policy</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>66ADD358-A6CE-4C44-A08B-63F93F33F0DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked questions and there was a lively discussion afterwards of whether UK standards for Undergraduate social science are lower than in the USA and Canada.

We surveyed 165 students in year 1 and 130 in year 3 of the grant. Along with focus groups and interviews, the research data allowed us to feed back to academic staff in the University of Manchester about the student experience. 

Students experienced new teaching materials in 12 course units. Their teachers and teaching assistants Graduate Teaching Assistants widened their use of data and online evidence sources. 

Each year, methods of embedding were the subject of academic staff meetings focused on teaching quality.
Specialised techniques were taught in a series of national workshops in Oxford, Cardiff, London, Edinburgh and Manchester. 

The academic publication in the IJSRM will reach both a national and international audience.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CD6E0CE7-4941-494D-98B3-BE7619B7ABBC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>558c063c998b19.38372901</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant is held jointly with a Curriculum Innovation grant. One publication summarises the pedagogical findings of our shared effort. This publication in International Journal of Sociological Research Methods (Buckley, et al., 2015) advises how &amp;quot;quantitative embedding&amp;quot; can successfully enhance teaching to social science. The second achievement is a data set combining student surveys and a questionnaire for teachers of sociology and politics. These questionnaire data are being deposited. The data have been analysed in relation to the obstacles students face in learning with quantitative data. We also have mixed methods data.

The second paper to be published from this project is specific to this grant and is targeted at the journal Sociology. Thus paper two, which is underway, presents the second set of findings from this project. Finally, we also produced online versions of our findings in the form of Briefing Papers numbered one and two. The first briefing paper on scaffolding relates closely to Paper One in IJSRM. The briefing paper was used in 11 workshops over three years to influence staff in their curriculum management. Briefing Paper two relates to Paper two (not yet submitted). This briefing paper on using data in dissertations covers all the teaching skills we had promised in our grant bid. It advertises NESSTAR and some even better alternatives for downloading data subsets. It explains the importance of dense graphics and it advocates interpretive complexity. It advocates that some dissertations could use data in a light fashion, and others in a heavier, statistical fashion. Our mailing list for the briefing papers and workshops consists of all participants as well as 350 lecturers in the north of England whom we particularly targeted. In conclusion, we have two papers, one data set and two Briefing Papers all aimed at training for trainers in sociology and politics. 

Our website, http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/research/research-centres-and-networks/essted// (accessed June 2015) gives access to the new teaching materials from our project. The briefing papers have been popular for over two years in their online PDF format. We created 8 videos of which 5 are of a professional standard. Each has a different world-class lecturer presenting advice on using data in classrooms. The topics range from employability to assessing students. Another three videos were provided in YouTube from 2013 onward, showing how to flip a lecture and how to innovate in sociology teaching. Lastly, the rich case studies of teaching material from the Curriculum Innovation part of our work are also provided in the website.

One barrier to holding workshops on pedagogy is that some busy academic staff feel they cannot afford the time for personal development or training. We find this short sighted. Our workshops included middle managers and early career researchers. We advised everyone to strategically take training in both online and face to face formats. In view of this we held workshops in London at the NatCen offices, in Edinburgh, and also twice in Cardiff University.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Research on quantitative embedding in the undergraduate circle has been expanding. Our papers will contribute to an international discussion in which British undergraduate social scientists are perceived as noticeably behind American undergraduates in social science because of a quantitative deficit.

Besides researchers, teachers from universities across Britain have expressed interest in our findings. We attended the conferences of British Sociological Association and the Political Studies Association where we were received well. Wendy Olsen presented in plenary at the Research Methods festival and at Oxford University. Videos are still circulating of these events. Lastly, the Royal Statistical Society and British Academy are promoting our agenda. We also received a QStep grant (2015-2019).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AFD4E08C-5A6B-4578-BE58-714434547EA3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>558c045b111b69.32815960</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/research/research-centres-and-networks/essted//</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Methods Summer Schools: Influencing Content Internationally</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5D328EA9-C886-41DD-9151-52E95D93B6BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My training elements have been exposed in a series of Youtube videos, workshops in UK and briefing papers online, after which the following impacts happened:
1. the content of the Berlin Summer School in Social Sciences was widened to include epistemological issues and qualitative comparative analysis, including a realist approach. I was invited for a funded stay in Berlin to manage a whole day of training in this premier international summer school of Social Science PhD students. 
2. the content of the Sciences-Po Summer School on Comparative Social Science in 2013 included material from me on a funded visit to Biarritz where I stayed for 3 days presenting, with translation into French, on methodologies of mixed methods, a set of new ideas which widened the content of the school. The participants were from Social Sciences across over eight different country origins and were doing PhDs from top international universities, having won bursaries from the French government to attend this one-week event.
3. I was able to construct a new Summer School lasting one week in manchester under the Methods@Manchester umbrella in 2014. This summer school was focused on Integrated Mixed Methods Research and will now be an annual event. The training will be annual from now on. It attracted policy-engaged PhD students nearly finished with their PhDs coming from Britain and Netherlands.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54638f0096a979.90001291</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.methods.manchester.ac.uk/events/summerschool/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>1.

The users of the course unit elements initially were Univ. of Manchester lecturers, all named in the bid, and their students. Each lecturer participated in two bespoke consultations and was provided with a dedicated pedagogically experienced expert in secondary data analysis who helped with refining a lecture or tutorial task that fits into a given syllabus. Next this material was tested in the classroom and evaluations were conducted using mixed methods, with both staff and students as respondent. The students in the local Univ. of Manchester classrooms also evaluate the materials and their learning experience using a survey. 
The student survey was conducted on University of Manchester campus 2012-2013 with followup in classrooms in 2014/5. The survey of students initially drew upon a self-selecting set of respondents, aiming at all classroom attenders, from 1st year - 3rd year students, giving us about their views of quantitative data and methods, and answering a battery of questions that would give us a measure of quantitative skills. These surveys, known as 'evaluation' surveys internally, were applied in BA Economics and BA Social Sciences classrooms, but drew from a variety of degrees, whose names were not included in the data. For example, there are Honour and ordinary degree students, students with single honours and dual (or joint degree) honours, and students in accounting and finance as well as those whose specialist subjects were in the six Social Science disciplines in Manchester at the time: politics, sociology, philosophy, economics, anthropology (and Social Statistics, which existed at the University of Manchester since 2009, but did not have any major or dual major students at the time). The degree programmes represented are listed in Figure 1 (below).
The students who took part in the 2015 survey were second and third year students taking part in either a politics or a sociology class. 
From 183 raw respondents in Year 1 there were 325 in Year 3, giving 508 respondents overall.
In year 1, survey respondents were in course units on racism, comparative politics and policy making. In year 3, a wider range of courses were used; their names are not listed here.
The participating students were primarily recruited from partner modules, ie those where the lecturer had agreed to meet twice with Project staff in either the Curriculum Innovation project or the Researcher Development Initiative project, to plan an embedding of quantitative methods into the classroom experience of students.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4E27A84E-D0CA-491F-8260-E6CADEEA3EC8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Q-Step grant held at University of Manchester is strongly influenced by the findings of this project.
