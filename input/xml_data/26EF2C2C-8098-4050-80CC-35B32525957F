Diabetes substantially increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. However, there is compelling evidence that diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke much more in women than in men. The reasons which underlie these sex differences are largely unknown. This research aims to find out why diabetes appears to have a stronger effect on the risk of heart disease and stroke in women than in men. 
 
The diagnosis of diabetes is based on an arbitrary value of sugar in the blood. People with levels of blood sugar just below that threshold are also at higher risk for heart disease and stroke. In the first part of this research, I will therefore better characterise how different levels of blood sugar increase the risks of heart disease, stroke, and other complications of diabetes such as chronic kidney disease and blindness. I will also assess whether this differs between men and women. In part two, I will use genetic principles to assess whether the sex-specific findings from part one are likely to be causal. Part three will look at which biological factors may underpin women's excess risk of heart disease and stroke associated with diabetes. Previous studies have suggested that differences between men and women in body shape, body weight, and obesity may play an important role. Factors unique to women, such as the menopause or pregnancy may also be involved. This will be further investigated. Apart from biological explanations, it may be that inconsistencies in health service delivery explain why the health outcomes in men and women with diabetes are different. For example, it may be that women are diagnosed later than men or that they do not receive the same treatments as men. Thus, part four will see whether there are potential differences between men and women with diabetes in health service delivery according to the recommended guidelines. 
 
This research will deliver the best available evidence on potentially important differences between women and men in the health behaviours, health care, and health outcomes associated with diabetes and vascular diseases. This evidence will guide health care professionals and policymakers in prioritising interventions and in optimising health care systems aimed at reducing the large health burden and costs associated with diabetes. It will provide policy, management and practice recommendations that will be of direct relevance to the NHS. Ultimately, this research should help to (1) ensure that women are not disproportionally affected by the vascular consequences of diabetes, (2) optimise health service delivery nationwide, (3) avert the onset of diabetes in many individuals, and (4) improve the lives of people living with diabetes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Vascular disease is the major cause of death and disability in people with diabetes. Compelling evidence has shown that the relative risks of major macrovascular diseases conferred by diabetes are considerably greater in women than in men. The factors underpinning these sex differences are largely unknown. 
 
I aim to create a leading programme of research that aims to further understand the sex differences in the vascular consequences of diabetes. Since diabetes is defined based on an arbitrary level of a continuous trait, i.e. measures of glyceamia, such as fasting blood glucose or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), my objectives are to assess: 
1. the sex-specific effects of glyceamic levels on the relative risks of micro- and macrovascular outcomes 
2. through Mendelian Randomisation analyses, whether the sex-specific effects of glyceamic levels on vascular disease risk are likely to be causal 
3. which biological factors contribute to the sex-specific effects of glyceamic levels on vascular diseases 
4. whether differences in health service delivery contribute to the sex-specific effects of diabetes on vascular diseases 
 
This research will utilise individual participant data from large contemporary datasets with extensive phenotypic and genotypic detail: UK Biobank (Obj. 1 and 3), linkages of multiple national electronic health records (Obj. 1 and 4) and summary-level data from large international genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consortia (Obj. 2). 
 
This project provides new insights in why there are sex differences in the vascular consequences of diabetes. This could inform the development of new interventions, and will inform policy makers in the designing sex-specific guideline recommendations for prevention and treatment of diabetes and vascular diseases. This could help ensure that women are not disproportionately affected by the vascular consequences of diabetes and will help reduce the burden of diabetes and vascular disease in both</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The first and foremost potential of this project is the positive impact it can have on the health of millions of people worldwide. Through analyses of 'big data' from the UK Biobank, multiple large linked electronic health records, and international GWAS consortia, I will provide detailed insights of sex differences in the vascular consequences of diabetes. This will not only improve our understanding about the etiology of disease, which could inform in optimizing the allocation of existing medications or the development of new interventions, but could also guide health care professionals and policy makers in defining strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and vascular disease. This will ensure that women are not disproportionally affected by the vascular consequences of diabetes, and helps to ameliorate the effects of diabetes in men. 
 
New insights in the factors underpinning the sex differences in the vascular consequences of diabetes may spark new hypotheses for future research in a range of academic disciplines, including basic science, epidemiology, women's health, and health policy and services. Academia will also benefit from this research through the development and application of new skills and methods, including the evaluation of sex differences in complex biological mechanisms, Mendelian Randomisation, and the assessment of missed opportunities in health service delivery using routinely collected health data. I will share these advanced quantitative techniques through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and interactions with colleagues and collaborations in research seminars and journal clubs. 
 
This research will be of direct relevance for health policy makers and guideline development. The American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for CVD prevention incorporate sex-specific recommendations. Moreover, the AHA published a scientific statement on sex differences in the cardiovascular consequences of diabetes mellitus, identifying several pressing areas, including those addressed in the current proposal, that would be benefit from further research. The outputs of this research will fill some of these gaps and will supply health policy makers with the best available evidence about the importance of considering sex in prevention and treatment guidelines. This could lead to improved clinical decision making and better health service delivery. 
 
Charities such as Diabetes UK and the BHF will also benefit from this research. For instance, the BHF increasingly emphasises the importance of differences between men and women in cardiovascular disease and actively promotes research in this area. My work could raise awareness of important sex differences in health outcomes and may inform public campaigns, research agendas, and other engagement activities. 
 
The 2014 Report of the UK Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, was dedicated to 'The Health of the 51%: Women'. In keeping with this annual report, which was widely covered in the media, the present research is likely to provide new insights in the health of women in the UK and to provide a range of recommendations to improve it. It is likely to identify missed opportunities for intervention in women's health and to raise awareness in the wider public about clinically meaningful differences between women and men in the context of diabetes and vascular diseases. 
 
Some of the benefits from this research, such as providing new mechanistic insights, raising awareness, and stimulating new academic and public discussions, can be achieved within the course of this fellowship. Implementation of the research findings in clinical guidelines might be possible towards the end or just after the lifetime of this fellowship. Findings are most likely to inform the development of new therapies and interventions or projections of the future burden of diabetes and vascular disease after completion of this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>422155</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7FA383C3-7C33-415B-AA50-91A097CF882D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Women's reproductive factors and incident cardiovascular disease in the UK Biobank.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Heart (British Cardiac Society)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b7daee98c7d288fe9d8420024484dc3e"><gtr:id>b7daee98c7d288fe9d8420024484dc3e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peters SA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1355-6037</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a6f3126dfdbb0.94345070</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P014550/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>2472941E-25F2-45EC-A735-3C0872CE6B26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.3  Psychological, social and economic factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>3BEA012A-C817-4067-8BE1-05331EBB5152</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.2  Evaluation of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>B7F5A9CA-62C7-4E68-A2B2-3D6CCA85E16B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>7.3  Management and decision making</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
