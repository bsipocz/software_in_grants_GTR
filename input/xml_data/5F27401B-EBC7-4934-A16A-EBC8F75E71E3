TSB Application Number: 79958-520147</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/R00420X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The objective of the project is to develop beyond state-of-the-art highly stabilised laser sources whose high performance coupled with cost-effectiveness and compact size enhances access of researchers/technologists into a broad range of Quantum Technologies (QTs) and provides the basis for integration into future commercial Quantum Technology instrumentation. Diode-pumped Alexandrite laser technology will be developed in a commercial platform with precision highly-stabilised wavelength tunablility over a broad band and sub-MHz ultra-narrowlinewidth control, as required for Quantum Technology applications. The ability to directly diode-pump the vibronic solid-state Alexandrite laser provides the basis as a significantly lower cost, more compact replacement to the current mainstream titanium-sapphire laser technology. Due to direct diode-pumping the Alexandrite technology has excellent power scaling potential to the multi-W and multi-ten-Watt power level addressing future demands in commercially-scaled QT systems.

The project brings together commercial partner, M-Squared Lasers (MSL) and academic team at Imperial College London (IC). The IC academic team are the world-leading group in diode-pumped Alexandrite lasers, with world-record demonstrations of highest power (&amp;gt;26W), highest efficiency, and broadest tuning range, and notable first Q-switching and cavity-dumped Q-switching developments made for satellite-based lidar application for the European Space Agency (ESA). MSL bring a track record for innovative commercial laser development and award-winning laser products. The scientific and technical expertise of the IC group combined with the engineering, commercial and market knowledge skills of MSL provides a solid basis to accelerate the translation of Alexandrite laser technology from research laboratory to a new specification and commercial product platform to address the growing needs of Quantum Technologies.

An Alexandrite Ring Laser (ARL) pre-prototype system will be designed with wavelength tuning and narrowlinewidth control, and significant power target, leading to a first pre-prototype ARL to be built and performance characterised at Imperial (Milestone 1). A second pre-prototype ARL system will be built at MSL to provide further performance optimisation of specification and operation as a demonstrator for QT applications (Milestone 2). Imperial will modify the first pre-prototype for demonstration and validation of feasibility of power scaling (Milestone 3). MSL will couple their pre-prototype to QT application with demonstration to potential users (Milestone 4). Market study and Technology Roadmap will be made for the development of the Alexandrite laser technology and its commercialisation (Milestone 5).

The successful outcome of this project will lead to new cutting-edge laser technology with highest performance and low cost/compact format that will enable current and future Quantum Technology processes and applications including cooling, atomic clocks and gyroscopes for navigation; gravimeters for military and earth observation; secure communications etc.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential disruptive nature of Quantum Technology has been recognised by the UK Government through its investment in the area announced in 2013. This followed growing recognition of the field and its potential for impact (cf. the Witty report in 2013 on the importance of university research-led innovation on economic growth) as well as the recognition of the shortcomings and vulnerabilities of conventional technology (e.g. as evidenced by The Royal Academy of Engineering report on Global Navigation Space Systems in 2011). The consortium behind this proposal is committed to driving the innovation and impact based on expertise and excellence in Quantum Technology enabling laser research. Central to this agenda is the creation of a UK Quantum Technology industry and associated supply chain with strong academic backing.

The specific beneficiaries of this project will be academic, commercial and societal:

The academic beneficiaries of the research and output of this project activity will include: Laser research community; researchers and users of Quantum Science and Technologies; researchers in a broader range of disciplines who use or would also be enabled by new precision, wavelength stabilised, user-friendly laser technology. The external research beneficiaries will be both UK and International reached by high impact journal publication and conference presentation. Project and associated Post-Doctoral researchers and postgraduate students in our academic laboratory will benefit through training/expertise /collaborative exchanges; new industrial/engineering skills and additional resources for our academic laboratory at Imperial College will underpin and initiate new research, applications, collaborations and further funding opportunities resulting from this project activity. 

The commercial and societal beneficiaries include enabling a UK supplier base targeting Quantum Technologies and research. This project establishes a new collaborative relationship between Imperial College and MSquared Lasers, which will provide a link between a world leading research and a cutting-edge innovator and supplier of high performance laser systems and technology in MSquared Lasers. The intellectual property developed by Imperial College London will be protected where appropriate through the Imperial Innovations Ltd, the technology transfer office at Imperial. The University has a strong track record in industrial engagement and the creation of spin-out companies including the PI of the Imperial academic team (Prof M Damzen) who has experience as Founder, CSO and Director of Spin-Out laser company Midaz Lasers Ltd over its operational period from 2006 until its successful trade sale in 2012. Midaz designed, assembled and sold engineered laser amplifier products to the precision laser manufacturing market, incorporating patented solid-state laser technology arising from his team's research lab. There are only relatively few commercial competitors in the Quantum Technologies market, none of them UK, and this includes laser systems tailored specifically for use in quantum technology applications. The few global suppliers (such as ColdQuanta) are to some extent also targeting the research market but are unsuitable for a UK supply chain due to US ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) restrictions. Hence, the potential for exploitation of the next generation of this technology, through e.g. UK Ministry of Defence support, will require an established sovereign capability. Devices where the higher precision afforded by Quantum Technologies can make a big difference include: atomic clocks (satellite-free navigation; finance), gravimeters (military; earth observation; prospecting), gyroscopes (navigation) and computing/secure communications (banking; military).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174099</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R00420X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
