It selects as its case study the area of Historic Cairo, in tandem with the Urban Regeneration project for Historic Cairo (launched by UNESCO-WHC in 2010), in order to address the interface between past and present in multi-dimensional ways. The intellectual research is motivated by questions of what of the past continues in the present and of how the living transmission of the past is effected, as will be explored through workshops bringing together UK and Egyptian scholars and arts practitioners and through the screening of documentaries pertinent to this enquiry. Building on this basis, research by practice will involve communities in the curating of their own artisanal and creative products, together with the cultural memories and legacies attendant on these, through both oral history and specialist ateliers. Conventional approaches will be combined with more experimental methods as the working communities of Historic Cairo and contemporary visual artists, musicians and writers from Egypt and the UK will be brought together in order to create a forum for the sharing of skills and ideas towards, in the first instance, an exhibition, with the further aim of generating new forms of entrepreneurship leading to increased revenue opportunities. In addition, the psycho-geography of Cairo will be explored through the analysis of dreams in relation to Egyptian myths, folk tales and literature as will be disseminated through a short film. The project will serve to realize connections between the traditional and contemporary, between the popular culture of the past and the popular and youth cultures of the present, and between Egyptian cultural heritage and international recipients, with outputs including publications and an insiders' heritage map. In the process of this range of activities, new cultural, social and intellectual networks will be formed towards the establishment of a new research centre and the ongoing preservation of heritage through community engagement.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It will be of benefit to:
a) the communities engaged with in Historic Cairo. They will be involved in curating their own contributions to cultural heritage through oral history projects and through invited contributions to the planned exhibition. In being introduced to contemporary artists in different fields (visual art, photography, film, music and performance), they will receive opportunities to acquire new skills and new ideas in re-creating the past and in appealing to audiences. This will be of social benefit, mitigating against social alienation, and of economic benefit as the collaborative projects and knowledge transfer will lead to increased revenue opportunities.
b) policy-makers in the field of heritage preservation. The research by practice aims to bring community participants together with contemporary artists in an unprecedented way. Traditional practices and the contemporary arts tend to operate in distinct spheres and this venture will serve to establish new ways in which the preservation of heritage may be conducted, particularly with respect to intangible heritage. Community engagement will be a means of extending the responsibility of preserving heritage.
c) Egyptian citizens and tourists, both local and international. Through the exhibition and insiders' heritage map, awareness of both intangible and tangible heritage will be promoted. This will in turn promote wider citizen ownership of cultural heritage as well as cultural tourism amongst those interested in not only Ancient Egypt but contemporary Egypt, in particular on the part of young, adventurous tourists. 
d) Egyptian musicians and artists. There will be opportunities for international curators and audiences to gain greater awareness of modern and contemporary arts in Egypt which will help promote these arts on an international stage. Egypt is under-represented on this stage, as regards international engagement with the MENA region, and Egyptian art and music markets could benefit economically through greater dissemination and wider publicity.
e) Curators of Egyptian arts and crafts, both in Egypt and the UK, especially in that dialogue will be created between curators and communities around the socio-cultural values and meanings inherent in specific arts and crafts. In the UK, contact will be made with the British Museum regarding its new initiative on curating modern Egypt.
f) The education sector. Materials will be produced that could be used on courses in the field of cultural heritage where a greater understanding of intangible heritage in terms of 'the living past' could be used to inform many other projects.
g) Psychotherapists interested in developing culturally grounded forms of psycho-affective analysis.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31273</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The map shows images of the main sites of interest in El Moez Street with descriptions of their significance.

El Moez Street's main bookshop has agreed to stock the maps. At the moment the maps are in Arabic and aimed initially at Egyptian cultural visitors to the area, while English translations are being prepared for the tourist market. 

The art exhibition showing new works of how artists interpret the 'living heritage' theme will initially be in El Moez Street, while the Egyptian Educational and Cultural Bureau in London have agreed to host the exhibition in the future as means of promoting the work internationally. 

Collaboration has taken place between the ICA's Masafat Festival and Egypt's Living Heritage through an exchange of public talks, and this may lead to further collaborative ventures involving Egyptian contemporary artists. Connection has also been made with Oxford Maqam's wax cylinder recording project as a means of pooling expertise on musical heritage and the material conditions of its transmission. We are also working with the Governor of Cairo towards the establishment of a Naguib Mahfouz Centre, and towards a film of the project to disseminate the living heritage explored. There has been media interest in the project as it has been reported on in several Egyptian newspapers and in Egypt's leading literary journal. The project is seen as making a contribution to the regeneration of El Moez Street through new community-based interpretations of literary heritage of interest to the general public.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E41F7144-4083-4F42-AC0F-E910E0CBDFFE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58bee837b69955.06792594</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The workshops and ateliers on documentary film and on literature have demonstrated how Egyptian filmmakers and writers engage with the notion of 'the living past' in terms of the transmission of widely shared continuous cultural values. There will be two further workshops on visual art and music to develop this work, alongside a concert and two exhibitions. This material will lead to a book offering new perspectives on intangible heritage and popular/ folk culture. Discussions have focussed on the inadequate translation of Egyptian terms for what is at stake towards a clearer concept of 'living heritage' as interpreted across the arts. A new module is being developed from this material to contribute to the MA in Cultural Heritage at the French University of Egypt in that 'the living heritage' angle is considered to be a methodological innovation. In addition, there have been debates on how universities might draw more widely on the resources of documentaries in the teaching of socio-cultural history.

The sessions on dream interpretation served to bring together Arab and European approaches to such. In particular, they entailed drawing on dream interpretation exercises used by the London Freud Museum to engage with the public followed up by visits to the shrine of Ibn Sirin (the foremost dream interpreter in Egypt, and mentioned by Freud in his The Interpretation of Dreams) in order to make contact with the keeper of the shrine, Sheik Moustafa. Following on from this, two dream interpretation gatherings were convened with Sheik Moustafa and members of the UK-Egypt team, the second of these at an El Moez Street location enabling the participation of local workers (shop-keepers and cleaners) and local students. The sharing of dreams across divides of class, nationality, gender and age proved to be an illuminating process, as an article in progress will explain. Amongst other findings, it generated a sense of community and thus it has been proposed to offer a new scope for the oral history side of the project. That is, it is envisaged that inhabitants of the area may be willing to share their dreams of it as well as memories of it.

Community engagement has been effected by means of the above workshops, through documentary screenings at an El Moez Street venue and through the oral history project. In addition, memorabilia exhibits have been collected from people in the area towards an upcoming exhibition, and two cultural maps have been produced: one on the landmark buildings of the area and one around the life and writings of Naguib Mahfouz (Egyptian's most important writer who grew up in the alleyways off El Moez Street). There have been skills workshops conducted on photography and curation, with an upcoming one on re-performing music from the past. These activities have entailed collaboration between UK and Egyptian researchers, artists and curators.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research findings will taken forward in the programmes of those involved in it, as discussed above.
