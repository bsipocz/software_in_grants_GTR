Over the past five years the programme has funded over 300 projects working with well over 500 community partners and organisations. A partner could be a museum or a cultural organisation, a freelance artist, a voluntary or advocacy group?the programme seeks to be definitionally open. Connected Communities aims to be both interdisciplinary (hence the fact that although led by AHRC, its award holders are also funded by other research councils such as Economic and Social Research Council), and at the same time to have a core arts and humanities presence. The academic leadership of the programme is given by two Leadership Fellows, each appointed for three years from 2012. The purpose of this grant application is to renew the Leadership Fellowship of Prof George McKay for a further three years, 2015-2018. It includes an administrator, two postdoctoral researchers, and key activities include working with academics and community partners on their funded projects, liaising with the AHRC and other funding bodies, a new set of activities and events collaborating with the Leadership Fellows for other AHRC themes (Care for the Future, Digital Transformations, Translating Cultures, and Science in Culture), as well as undertaking personal research work related to the programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>626992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>EFG London Jazz Festival</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Impact of Festivals project</gtr:description><gtr:id>33EA3E22-E238-4DE4-9719-4A1BC5C3305F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Events and publications listed elsewhere on RF (can't you have a cross-ref mechanism?)

This year long programme encompassed a range of events, from regional events in local communities to large international conferences bringing together researchers from the arts and humanities (and other disciplines where appropriate), research organisations, community groups, creative practitioners and other community partners.

Our largest scale Utopias event was the Connected Communities Festival exploring Community Futures and Utopias which saw local activities taking place across the country between March and July. The Festival was undertaken in partnership with The Somerset House Trust as a part of Utopia 2016: a year of Imagination and Possibility - four seasons of events, exhibitions and new commissions celebrating the idea of Utopia to mark the 500th anniversary of Thomas More's influential text. Utopia 2016 was a partnership between the Somerset House Trust and its neighbours King's College London and the Courtauld Institute and Gallery.

The 2016 Festival supported high quality participatory arts research and research co-production activities across the UK on the theme of community futures and utopias and provided an opportunity to explore creative ways to build upon, and widen and deepen community engagement with, research being undertaken by the Connected Communities Programme and with wider AHRC/RCUK-funded research</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c00f27af9410.97212177</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.utopia500.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Member of scientific committee Keep It Simple Make It Fast, 3rd international conference, University of Porto</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D35E928C-BBAD-4D35-8E88-73767759D26A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Involvement in organising committee for this 3rd gathering of scholars, independent riders, musicians and activists working around EU punk scenes and movements and histories.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c01014bfe1e7.66180935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.kismifconference.com/en/call-conference-2/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wroclaw, European Jazz Network Conference, European jazz research network panel member</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28F8649C-43FC-4E3C-AA33-DDC5D616640A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academics met with musicians and journalists, arts administrators to discus establishment of a EU-wide network of jazz researchers to collaborate with EJN members at their events and activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c022a5e708e9.48458539</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lead organiser (with Profs Charles Forsdick and Paul Gilroy) AHRC Reggae Research Network and conference UEA/Liverpool/London</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>781DAF9C-6BC7-4DE0-8827-A8B3B54A50E1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>George to check:

This Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded network is a joint initiative between the Translating Cultures theme and the Connected Communities programme, and is open to researchers and partners funded under those areas, as well as to the wider academic and music communities.The network's programme of activities explores the neglected important popular music, political, religious culture of reggae.

The purpose of this first symposium was to begin scoping the field of research and public engagement activity so we could see where work on reggae is already being undertaken and also to begin to think about research gaps. The Symposium was attended by 40 people, with a range of speakers, both based in the UK and internationally, who talked about and presented their work on areas including:

?Current and recent funded research projects on reggae and related areas
?PhD students introducing their reggae-related research topics
?Wider public knowledge activity on reggae, including exhibitions
?Academic researchers presenting their own work in the field.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c01af8c70ea5.53236941</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.reggaenetwork.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organiser of Connected Communities and Utopia Conference at the British Library</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A913067D-9739-47F0-8741-1B943246354C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 'Connected Communities and Utopia' Conference aimed to look back at the year long Utopia 500 programme to consider what we know about utopia and community that we didn't know before and to share reflections on Utopia 500 that might be useful in Utopia 501. 60 people attended including Connected Communities Researchers and Community Partners who had taken part in Utopia 500 as well as members of the public.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c014b8814ca3.89556105</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.utopia500.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Member of Organising Committee for Rhythm Changes 4th International Conference, Jazz Utopia, Birmingham City University</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8ACCA68B-FB1C-4C60-BD3B-38DC4E40FC57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>4th in our series of international gatherings around jazz studies, which are characterised by dialogue between academic researchers, industry figures, musicians and other creatives.

Collaborative research across the arts and humanities field is further enhanced and support by Connected Communities, and by its Leadership Fellows.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5124D23D-9441-49C1-B315-BF3DCED5ECF9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d4518d899fb1.15481029</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Really a little early to articulate key findings specific to this renewal of the award--but related to stage one fellowship:

With well over 300 projects funded and 500 community partners participating in Connected Communities this very large programme has identified and shared best practice and new thinking around the co-design and co-production of research--high level arts and humanities collaborative research practice. Across the programme we continue to work on strengthening CC's potentially transformative legacy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Learning about CC research partnerships--eg best practice of AHRC collaborating with HLF.

Further investment in programme legacy and policy work, identification of and work with key relatively under-resourced arts and humanities areas to date (e.g. literature), working across themes with other Leadership Fellows to identify common areas, problem ,solutions, dialogues, arguments and dissensus.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7E0D3E10-C65D-41F4-AC92-181C068E7669</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d45f9d957382.95043806</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://connected-communities.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DA38B8CC-6862-4851-BA99-39BD9EDC4435</gtr:id><gtr:title>From Glastonbury to Glyndebourne: The Impact of British Music Festivals</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/567fe7f2cdaaff2ad2873058cdedc34e"><gtr:id>567fe7f2cdaaff2ad2873058cdedc34e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Webster, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bedb7dc88db2.90263060</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>91EE6C51-F4B5-488C-B6B4-58DA11D85E8B</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of (jazz) festivals: An Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded research report</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Jazz Research Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a0ddff220ba13b360a80d182d7f62fab"><gtr:id>a0ddff220ba13b360a80d182d7f62fab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Webster E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bed7215c7210.18277175</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4B7746CC-C5E0-4293-959D-633D1F0E8AAB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Skinny blues: Karen Carpenter, anorexia nervosa and popular music</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Popular Music</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/56c559e535a571e62c33dfb9a7c27ffd"><gtr:id>56c559e535a571e62c33dfb9a7c27ffd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKay G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a799ea6066b76.12904853</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>292DDDCB-008C-4575-A28E-691B1316A93A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gee Vaucher: Introspective</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/37d17368e555b51283b80031c2344439"><gtr:id>37d17368e555b51283b80031c2344439</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKay, G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bed8ef412321.81998792</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6F900426-108A-4E10-8189-0DC4041C6C5F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Aesthetic of our Anger: Anarcho-Punk, Politics and Music</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/37d17368e555b51283b80031c2344439"><gtr:id>37d17368e555b51283b80031c2344439</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKay, G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bed9be9af9d2.50435753</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6078475A-4B5E-49A6-800C-3C661341040D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Annotated Bibliography of The Impact of Music Festivals Research Review</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/567fe7f2cdaaff2ad2873058cdedc34e"><gtr:id>567fe7f2cdaaff2ad2873058cdedc34e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Webster, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bedc29c08538.83758928</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N504488/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
