This research network is part of a project aiming to rectify that situation. The English word 'alienation' has a number of different senses including, crudely: a state or process of estrangement; a transferral or renunciation of ownership (roughly equivalent to the German Entfremdung and Ent&amp;auml;usserung respectively) and the experience of parts of my own mental life or body as not really being 'my own'. One of our main aims is to discuss these different senses and how they relate to notions such as reification (Marx's Vergegenst&amp;auml;ndlichung) and objectification. However, because we are concerned with the critical usefulness of the concept of alienation, the focus of the project is on its application (in its various guises) within the 'practical' areas of politics, environment and psychopathology, as much as on analyzing the concept in the abstract and scholarly re-examination of its treatment in classic texts. This concern with critical utility means we are interested also in exploring connections between thinking on alienation in those practical areas of politics, environment and psychopathology and philosophical pragmatism. There will be a workshop on each of these areas: alienation from nature; social and political alienation; psychological and self-alienation. Participants will be from the UK, Germany and elsewhere in Europe and North America. The overall project began with a workshop in Germany in January 2009, attended by scholars from these countries, and it is expected that the work done during this network stage will help form the basis of a larger bid in 2011 to explore the interdisciplinary implications and applications of alienation in such fields as psychology, psychiatry, public policy, sociology, geography and architecture.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This funding bid is to consolidate an international network of scholars interested in alienation. It is intended to be a stepping stone to a larger funding bid with a wider interdisciplinary focus and for more substantial communication resources and larger, more public, events. The impact on non-academic beneficiaries of this proposed one-year research network, considered just in itself, is difficult to predict, but likely to be small. However, considered as part of the larger ongoing project on alienation, the potential impact is much larger. \nThe notion and issue of alienation occurs in many areas of policy relevance and public interest. The themed workshops in the proposed network cover three of the main areas:\nThe context of environmental alienation encompasses issues of potential relevance to those concerned with, and devising policy about, the urban environment (architecture, town-planning), rural environments (land-use, agriculture) as well as more natural environments (national parks). The work done during the new thinking on alienation project, including the proposed network, should potentially help inform reflection on the meaning and importance of alienation from one's physical surroundings within debates both about the design of buildings and urban areas and about conservation and preservation policies concerning urban, rural and natural environments. \nThe topic of social and political alienation - the meaning and importance of alienation from one's social and political surroundings - is likewise relevant to many issues of wide (and increasing) public concern, including unemployment and political disaffection and apathy, and lack of identification within the workplace. \nThe topic of psychological alienation centers on the significance for personal identity and autonomy of experiencing or interpreting aspects of oneself as not one's own, and, as such, encompasses many issues of relevance to clinical psychologists and psychiatrists and others, including those concerned with the psychological implications of enhancement technology.\n As discussed in the case for support, we are interested in exploring the usefulness of the concept of alienation in these areas of life, at least as much as a scholarly re-appraisal of the relevant classical texts and a purely abstract analysis of the concept(s) of alienation. It is hoped that work done on the overall project, especially at the final stage, for which the proposed network is preparatory, will inform public reflection, discussion and policy formation in these areas. \nAlienation has also been an important theme within the literary, visual and other arts. A renewed interest in the topic may then have an impact on the arts and wider culture. \nIt should be emphasised that these potential social impacts are of the project as a whole and so are potentially indirect impacts of this research network. We are not claiming now for resources to 'reach out' to the various constituencies of potential non-academic beneficiaries of the overall project on alienation. However, papers from the workshops will be publicly accessible on the web, via the departmental websites at Liverpool, Dortmund and Cologne and an edited collection is anticipated. Some local scholars of relevant disciplines will be invited to attend the workshops. For example, in the Liverpool workshop on environmental alienation, colleagues from architecture, civic design and geography will be invited to attend for preliminary discussion of possible relevant practical and policy applications in their fields. But the main output of this network, from the perspective of potential impact on non-academic beneficiaries, is the larger bid expected to be submitted in 2011 in the light of the more focused philosophical discussions at the workshops.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12919</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New Thinking on Alienation project website</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:id>F79B0D78-CF06-4BAD-96AE-C1C88A34E542</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A website explaining the project and providing details of the three main workshops including drafts of some of the papers presented.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4686952302.8721590cda9f86</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Three workshops were run to discuss the concept of alienation in three different contexts: environmental alienation (Liverpool, 26th-27th February 2010); self/psychological (Dortmund, 20th-21st July 2010); social/political (M&amp;uuml;nster, 9th-10th December 2010) (we originally proposed to run this workshop in Cologne but one of the project leaders (Quante) moved from Cologne to M&amp;uuml;nster). The project was then extended until the end of June 2011 to encompass a further workshop (9th June) to discuss revised versions of a selection of papers (by Gunnarsson, Hailwood, Schramme and Vogel) from the three main workshops. These papers, together with papers by Howie and Stone, will be published in 2013 in a special edition of the journal Ethical Theory, Moral Practice devoted to the topic of alienation. At the time of writing two other papers presented have been published (Henning's paper in Philosophical Quarterly; Kraemer's paper in Neuroethics). The further workshop was made possible by funds left in the budget after the three originally mooted took place. The costs of these were significantly lower than expected mainly because three expected transatlantic speakers pulled out too late to arrange appropriately qualified alternative speakers. The workshops were organised to allow focused discussion of papers presented and numbers were restricted to facilitate this. Each involved the paper-givers and several local members of staff and research students with relevant interests, some of whom were given the experience of assisting with the organisation and chairing discussions. Two of the project leaders, Gunnarsson and Hailwood (PI), attended all four workshops; the other two project leaders, Howie and Quante, were able to attend only two and three respectively due to illness and other commitments. The workshops encompassed and explored a variety of philosophical perspectives on alienation, from the historical (including German Romanticism, Marx, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty) to contemporary environmental and political philosophy, analytical moral philosophy, pragmatism and neuroethics. This variety is evident in the draft papers and abstracts available on the project website, which was advertised on relevant email lists (philos-l and green politics). Something we looked for was a shared notion of alienation across the three contexts: a thin notion of estrangement (separation or distance) was evident in each context but, unsurprisingly, once contextual content was added the differences were more evident. More interestingly we confirmed our expectation that plausible notions of alienation as something 'positive' or not to be overcome entirely are defensible in each context. This was a feature of papers by Gunnarsson, Hailwood, Stone and Howie. Also interesting was the degree of overlap between different Philosophical traditions and areas once these are focused on the topic of alienation. The participants, including project leaders, are interested in pursuing the themes of the project further but have other projects occupying them in short-medium term. Likely future developments include exploring connections between critical theory, pragmatism and phenomenology. Some of the work of the New Thinking on Living with Dying AHRC Research Networking Project commencing in March 2012 (Howie as PI) will be informed by work on alienation from nature and self-alienation from this project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Work on the project could usefully inform the thinking of people interested in environmental problems in which alienation is assumed to be an issue (for example if climate change is taken to be an aspect of a general environmental crisis involving our 'alienation from nature'). Similarly with political problems (such as disaffection and disengagement from political processes), and psychological issues (such as one's sense of oneself and the impact on this of neuro-technology or of different ways of understanding the relationship between one's different and conflicting motivations). Work done on the project offere some new ways of thinking about such issues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B9C4AC63-7352-4B83-9D7F-CF278A8CEDC9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5399649427.644582775a7da2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Government/ Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.liv.ac.uk/philosophy/alienation/index.htm</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>74C8C207-A779-42A3-8CD9-9FB6A6172C9C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Alienation - New Perspectives from Environmental Ethics, Social Philosophy and Action Theory; an Introduction</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ethical Theory and Moral Practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/242e2c0965d0dcf4823c2d8c2943471c"><gtr:id>242e2c0965d0dcf4823c2d8c2943471c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Henning T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545a1f4d214555.48500059</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F2828846-70C7-4C19-8B7B-DF4739F7951F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Alienation and Nature in Environmental Philosophy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2e851734d6d85f416ed268646871a6b3"><gtr:id>2e851734d6d85f416ed268646871a6b3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hailwood</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781107081963</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56c339812dd0e3.76195146</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A5192882-B17D-42B4-A878-80811694C0AB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Me, Myself and My Brain Implant: Deep Brain Stimulation Raises Questions of Personal Authenticity and Alienation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neuroethics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c42f2fae2ed3df98bc8abcb6358b0505"><gtr:id>c42f2fae2ed3df98bc8abcb6358b0505</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kraemer F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1874-5490</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe0fe0181dd39</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C00BDDBC-DA12-47C8-91D9-B33D92A3B5D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>On Alienation from the Built Environment</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ethical Theory and Moral Practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1851cc183154c637011c7ef3b0fff68b"><gtr:id>1851cc183154c637011c7ef3b0fff68b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vogel, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545a24ce352c77.32424386</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6316F1E0-6C2C-48C3-A74A-EFCFFA77CEBB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Alienation from Nature and Early German Romanticism</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ethical Theory and Moral Practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f0faa7f8eec7970b9b2b3a1dd5c6ca15"><gtr:id>f0faa7f8eec7970b9b2b3a1dd5c6ca15</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stone A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfdbfdb106c0ef</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4CE2D0BF-23F7-4577-BCFF-6185A381B131</gtr:id><gtr:title>Alienations and natures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/37aa5396b68be526fdead6ae8a0cce85"><gtr:id>37aa5396b68be526fdead6ae8a0cce85</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hailwood S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03d03d4431c2b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>71177E88-B5F5-42AC-A1EC-1CF1C29E8CC4</gtr:id><gtr:title>WHY BE YOURSELF?
