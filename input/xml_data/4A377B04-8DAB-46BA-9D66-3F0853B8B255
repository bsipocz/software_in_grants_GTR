Firms such as Rolls Royce, GE, Xerox and Siemens are remaining competitive by creating additional value to their customers through the services they provide, and taking a share of this value. Over the years, providing services embedded within products' offerings has gradually become a fundamental business constituent for manufacturing organisations. 

Understanding the organisational transformation required to operate in this way has been an enduring challenge to both researchers and practitioners, and only a few notable contributions address the topic. Some prominent scholars have set out the benefits of, and barriers to, undertaking the transformation , while others describe the state of being a 'servitized' manufacturer and the impact this delivers, but few really deal holistically with the dynamics of the process of transformation itself, or distinguish what is particular about servitization over general organisational change. Although there are significant literature and theoretical frameworks in the general field of organisational change, no models exist to explain the servitization transformation process.

This project addresses this gap by consolidating the servitization knowledge base from the perspective of organisational change. Our integrative approach in this project will complement our goal of conducting a broad and inclusive study of the servitization transformation, which leads to identifying the stages of transformation, the key factors and forces that influence such transformation, and the key tasks and decisions in each stage. The purpose of the project is, therefore, to document the transformation of a manufacturing organisation as it moves towards competing through advanced services. In order to do this, the following research questions will be addressed:

(i) What stages might an organisation expect to go through as it progresses towards servitization? What are the critical decisions and activities that occur in each stage? (Process)
(ii) What are the principal factors and forces that affect progression through these stages? (Context) 
(iii) How do these stages and forces interplay as a model to demonstrate pathways towards servitization? (Content)</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic audiences outlined above, this research is expected to have a direct impact upon three separate non-academic groups, as well as the general public interested in manufacturing issues. 

The findings will have direct relevance, and provide strategic guidance, to the executives of those firms that are currently moving towards competing through advanced services and servitization. Product-focused manufacturing firms have realised that in a turbulent financial environment, servitization can certainly assist them in achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. However, due to the influence of different factors including organisational structure, customer demands and behaviour, market saturation, the triadic nature of service supply chains, and diffusion of innovation, the most challenging question is &amp;quot;how should we transform?&amp;quot;. By developing and proposing the pathways, actions and decision points that will lead them towards servitization, this project will greatly impact such firms. 

The development of the pathways will be informed by the established adopters of servitization, and the analysis of their transformation journey will, in turn, provide them with a more rationalised understanding of the ongoing process of servitization. These companies have followed emergent, organic strategies and now find themselves to be seen as exemplars of servitized firms. In all cases, they are continuing to evolve and develop their services strategies, and the systematic capturing of the stages that they have been through will assist them in revisiting some of the decisions and actions that have been taken, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their future plans and projects. 

Finally, the findings of the proposed research are likely to have practical implications for those parties helping both large and small firms to address their sustainability and scalability. Having surveyed 76 SMEs we identified that the principal barriers to their transformation towards servitization were financial and contractual complexities. Financial sector companies (e.g. banks) and legal firms have, in recent years, become much more interested in supporting these companies with servitization. This project will help these parties to understand what servitization is, how organisations approach it, and what stages organisations will go through. It will also help the companies to understand in which stage(s) of their transformation they most need the help from third parties such as banks and lawyers.

These impacts are expected to be delivered towards the identified groups through: (1) direct contacts with the case organisations throughout the study, (2) dissemination workshops, and (3) engagement and presentations in industry conferences and events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>205262</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P010148/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6A482B09-D749-4443-8AF0-654984FCE91D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufact.
