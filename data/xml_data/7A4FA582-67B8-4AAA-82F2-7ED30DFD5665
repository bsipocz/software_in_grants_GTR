The project will seek to deliver upon the following objectives:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>identify the learning and innovation capabilities that underlie successful development of entrepreneurial ventures&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>explore the nature and interaction among learning and innovation capability combinations and development outcomes in entrepreneurial ventures&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>develop a causal model that reflects the chain of effects between how firm resources are deployed, capabilities developed&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>contribute to developing an integrated theoretical foundation for capability development within an entrepreneurial venture context.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Initially, a series of exploratory, scoping case studies will be developed of entrepreneurial ventures at different stages of the growth lifecycle.This will be exclusively qualitative.Thereafter, a large, multi-wave, survey will be administered in line with the total design method protocol that sets the standard for advanced survey research methods. Finally, a database will be developed from secondary data of entrepreneurial ventures and their underlying capabilities using a series of methods based on secondary data. Therefore, both primary and secondary, and qualitative and quantitative data will be used to examine the form of causal relationships between learning capabilities and innovation capabilities. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will be of particular academic relevance and significance with potential to inform strategic stakeholders and policymakers as well as be of benefit to those who are involved in the research itself.
The Fellow, the Mentor and the Business School generally will of course benefit from the development of the new area of research, informing new research projects and allowing new aspects of expertise to contribute to research projects around the School. The very practical insights that the research will afford, will be able to contribute to the new teaching modules on entrepreneurship and innovation, and will give students a much more practical and 'real life' experience to their studies.
Those firms and businesses that the project engages directly with may be able to benefit from the project through a detailed understanding of the study, and the more immediate feedback and checking processes that will be in place as part of our data collection. Potentially businesses that are involved in the large scale survey may have reason to consider and act upon the matters that the Survey raises, and we will of course respond to any companies who wish to pursue a greater understanding of our work as a result of participation in the Survey. 
With regard to the practitioner community more widely, it is envisaged that there may be the potential to create management tools that reflect the findings of the study. These will be widely disseminated and will allow businesses to consider their innovation and product development within the context of the issues that the research will raise. 
The strategic learning outcomes of the research will be able to inform policy makers and business representation groups more significantly, and will have the potential to inform policy on the way in which government support for businesses can be most effective.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K002600/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
