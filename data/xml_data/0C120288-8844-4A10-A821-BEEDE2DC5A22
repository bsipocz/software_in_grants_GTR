The task of discovering new molecules with desired properties is constrained by the time it takes to make them leading to compromises. For example in pharmaceuticals when the need to use simple, easy to make compounds leads to cross-activity (interaction with other than the target biological system) as the compromise, and hence undesirable side effects. 
The aim of 'Dial-a-Molecule' is to make the synthesis of any desired molecule as quick as ordering an existing chemical from your supplier. A linked aim is to make production of chemicals more efficient with lower energy usage and less waste. 
The Dial-a-Molecule Network was established as one of three 'Grand Challenges' for Physical Sciences by EPSRC in 2010 with the aim that &amp;quot;In 20-40 years, scientists will be able to deliver any desired molecule within a timeframe useful to the end-user, using safe, economically viable and sustainable processes.&amp;quot; In its first phase it produced a roadmap (www.dial-a-molecule.com) to describe the advances needed to achieve the Grand Challenge. Strong collaborations with and input from other disciplines, such as mathematics, engineering, computer science, data science, and biology, is an essential component to realizing the aims of Dial-a-Molecule and in the second phase it progressed in building the multi-disciplinary community needed to tackle the challenge. It also started to promote a fundamental change in the way that synthetic chemistry is undertaken towards becoming a more data-centric discipline, embracing the data revolution and advances in computing power and technology that has occurred over the last 10 years. 

The current grant application seeks funding to extend the network for a 3 year period, with clear plans to be self-sustaining in some form at the end. Although the overall objectives remain unchanged, plans for Phase III of the network will focus on delivering impact in in six key themes covering changing way synthesis is carried out with a particular emphasis on data capture and use, developing new ways of carrying out and studying reactions with an emphasis on automation, inventing new reactions with a potentially transformative effect on the challenge, and establishing a UK infrastructure and profile in the area. The network will continue to promote inter-disciplinary mobility, and will put a strong emphasis on supporting Early Career Researchers. The network has been particularly successful in industrial engagement; this will be further developed through initiatives such as the Synthesis College and SME networks.

The network will organize a large number of open meetings aimed at bringing together different disciplines to discuss specific topics, identify opportunities, and establish new collaborations to seek funding. It will also directly facilitate applications for funding in the area by supporting meetings to refine ideas and consortia, supporting visits between partners, and funding small proof of concept projects. It will provide training in important areas, and facilitate the introduction of new techniques (software and automation) to help equip the next generation of researchers with necessary skills. The Network has the funding of three 'headline' projects as specific aims in phase III - a 'Dial-a-Molecule' Grand Challenge Institute to provide a national focus and critical mass of people and equipment; a national collection of catalysts and ligands; and a demonstration 'Dial-a-molecule' machine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Dial-a-Molecule Grand Challenge network builds capability though engaging people across a wide range of disciplines.

The network directly benefits members (industrial and academic) in many ways: the opportunity to publicise their work or products; learn about other work, particularly from other disciplines; to develop collaborations, again involving other disciplines or between academia and industry leading to new funding opportunities; provides the impetus to develop new research areas or products, again potentially attracting funding; as well as potential access to small sums of money for conference attendance, visiting other laboratories, or proof of concept studies. 

It benefits Industry by guiding academic research towards problems of current interest, and by making it more aware of current developments in areas of importance. 

It benefits people by extending their skill set through training in new methods so improving opportunities for jobs and personal development. Examples include use of electronic data capture, and the use of statistical, physical organic and chemical engineering tools. 

The scientific and technical advances the network aim to promote in the production of molecules 'to order' while minimizing the environmental footprint associated with the synthesis have immense potential impact: 
Knowledge Impact: Improvements in chemical synthesis through scientific advances in the reactions developed, equipment used, and the way data is obtained and used will allow anyone in academia or industry involved in chemical synthesis, or the applications of chemical entities to progress more quickly.

Economic Impact: The development of new techniques, strategies and ways of working will accelerate the development of new/improved products for end users improving competitiveness. It should also lower the economic and environmental cost of chemical production. 
The enhanced skill set of synthetic chemists Dial-a-Molecule promotes, and the establishment of a world leading Grand Challenge Institute, will both provide incentive for companies using advanced chemical synthesis to locate in the U.K.
Dial-a-Molecule will drive the development of new products (equipment, software and consumables) from the supply chain allowing the establishment and growth of companies producing them. If the model for new chemical entity delivery proposed by the 'synthesis machine' theme proves economically viable, it provides a new chemical synthesis business model. 

Societal Impact:
Policy. Dial-a-Molecule aims to influencing policy on the future of chemical discovery and manufacture and argues for the importance of increased government investment in UK science by demonstrating the societal and economic benefits that will accrue from its programs. 

Health. Advances in next-generation healthcare (personalized medicine, diagnostics, theragnostics, targeted therapies, drug delivery, modified biologies etc) will be driven by chemical technologies arising from Dial-a-Molecule. As drugs are designed to interact with only the receptor of interest, or are tuned to the specific genetic make-up of an individual, the requirement for rapid synthesis of complex molecules will spiral to the point where the Dial-a-Molecule technologies are essential for progress.

Environment: Many facets of Dial-a-Molecule have as their goal more sustainable processes/products with reduced environmental footprint and energy usage. One example is to developing catalysts using more readily available and less toxic metals than those currently used. Another is the drive towards data-driven study and optimization of reactions to give more efficient processes.

Overall we believe that the work promoted by the network will have considerable scientific, commercial and societal impact. An important function of the network is to provide a pathway to impact for such work and we believe we have the mechanisms in place to enable it.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>254038</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>254038</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Network Dial-a-Molecule Phase III</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/P007589/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>EA1059C3-9AA0-4599-A09D-B6F45313DB5C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7d2cf42ba88.95657917</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P007589/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>86C61AF7-DC51-4A18-9679-D0EFD3860BFF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design of Process systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
