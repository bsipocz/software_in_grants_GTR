The event was aimed at further disseminating the work of those projects and facilitating meeting between them. Talks were live streamed on Twitter. Central questions:
- A significant amount of online activity involves anti-social, offensive, or harmful behaviour, involving rumours, insults, or outright defamation. How can governance of conduct in digital social spaces be realised in a way that is both ethical and effective in practice? How far is this a matter for full-blown government involvement?
- It is often said that functioning democratic systems require some collective commitment or identity on the part of citizens. Information technology increasingly facilitates the formation of trans-national communities. What challenges does this technological trend pose to the way that we traditionally conceive of citizenship and statehood? If the 'common good' is one of our aims, how do we delineate membership of the relevant group(s)? Are governance structures keeping up?
- What counts as private is partly conventional and cultural, and internet culture is in flux. Given the arc of technological development, is there any future for privacy online? What special consideration ought we to give to political speech and activism? How do attitudes to privacy and democracy interact with new security measures and technologies?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff9feb52f86.99300821</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/ierg/events/citizens_online_schedule.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Limits of States workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8146A781-4EEB-4B82-B82D-78BD497E687B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The second integrator workshop, 'The Limits of States: Ethics, War, and Migration' took place on 28th June 2016.

Through examining approaches to ethics from a variety of perspectives and on a diverse range of topics, participants in this workshop enhanced their understanding of how ethics can facilitate and empower security policy. The audience comprised academics, professional practitioners and government policy makers, which sparked fruitful debate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58988850b7d5d6.77303442</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/ierg/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The projects involved in this 'Integrator' grant, and the findings presented at our concluding event in November 2016, generated debate and interest from practitioners and policymakers in attendance (see event summary).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>20D8A159-FAB3-4290-8148-3B08D60170D8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dff3842b32d8.23673530</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As our Research Integrator Proposal states, the primary aim of this integration project is to use cross-cutting ethical themes to connect the seven successful projects in the PCCSR Ethics and Security Call, and to communicate their results to a policy, practitioner, and wider public, audience. To this end we have met individually with each project, attended and participated in individual project events, set up a single website for the Ethics and Rights call, and held two dedicated integrator workshops. We will be holding the third and final integrator workshop in November. 
Between 12th May and 15th July 2015 we met with each of the seven project groups individually. These facilitated an understanding of the overall workings and direction of the Ethics and Rights Call. At each of these meetings the PI of the project was present along with some of the Co-Is, as well as a local university press officer. Minutes were circulated afterwards. In each case there was an overview of the Integrator role, an outline of the project's work packages and progress in completing these, and discussion of the project's contributions to the workshops. Furthermore, dissemination and press opportunities were discussed in each case. For instance, with the Hull project it was noted that they were planning to produce a policy brief and it was suggested to them that they may gain traction for this through the Industry and Parliament Trust or Westminster Briefings (groups with whom we have been involved in the past). With several of the projects there had been little or no prior connection between them and their university press officers. Discussion was held concerning how to maximise impact of publications, noting that it is important to let communications officers know timelines for publication so that they may form strategy, how to time release -- for example, news items of this type are more likely to be picked up in summer -- and how to find genuine consonance with project reasons for seeking press exposure.
Similarly, we urged the value of producing videos as ways of enhancing dissemination. This is a method that we have successfully deployed recently on the ESRC project Assuming Identities Online. The issue of funding for video production was raised by several of the projects: while some had access to in-house teams and facilities, others would require further funds to produce these. In one case we facilitated, through the Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research, a grant for video production. 
We also attended and participated in several project meetings: 'Surveillance and Citizenship' (Cardiff), 'IAMCR Preconference on Algorithmic Surveillance' (Leicester), and 'Digital Wildfire: respond now at the Digital Catapult!' (London). Furthermore, we met with the PACCSR external champion, Tristram Riley-Smith. These activities furthered our understanding of the individual projects and the direction of the ethics and rights call, and facilitated networking across them. 
The first workshop involved the projects based in Oxford, Hull, and Cardiff. It took place on 17th February 2016 in London and was entitled 'Citizens Online: Governing the internet and the possibility of privacy'. Presentations were made by Arne Hintz (Cardiff) and Ian Brown (Oxford) on 'Challenges to Digital Citizenship in the Age of Mass Surveillance'; Tom Sorell (Warwick) on 'Grooming Online'; Adam Edwards (Cardiff), on 'Social Media and Civil Society: Participation, Regulation and Governance' and James Connelly on 'Chasing the Common Good in the Cyber World'. The event was livestreamed on twitter via the periscope app and reached around 200 viewers. 
The second workshop, 'The Limits of States: Ethics, War, and Migration' took place on 28th June 2016. Its overarching theme concerned the frontiers of war and security. Presentations were made on 'Nuclear Ethics and Global Security: Reforming the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime' by Nicholas Wheeler (Birmingham); 'Moral Victories: Ethics, Exit Strategies, and the Ending of War' by Cian O'Driscoll (Glasgow); 'Acting as a Good International Citizen: Balancing Responsibilities or Dirty Hands?' by Derek Edyvane (Leeds) and James Souter (Leeds); 'Repairing the migrant crisis - Rights as ethics and a solidarity of care' by Tom Walker (Queens University Belfast) and Bal Sokhi-Bulley (Queens University Belfast); and 'Making 'regime change' possible despite the limits on intervention. A critical assessment of UK/French policy and discourse on Syria 2011/3' by Jason Ralph (Leeds). Along with academics, those attending included representatives of Chatham House and the FCO. 
Through this work and also in the final showcase workshop, held in London in November 2016, possible research projects and themes for future Calls have been identified, taking into account practitioner input.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The networking and dissemination outcomes of this project will be put to use in the formation of future collaborations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FE59738A-1C9A-4BD7-94A7-E60054942749</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dff36f339ab6.45226711</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.paccsresearch.org.uk/research/research-portfolio/ethics-and-rights-in-a-security-context/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N007441/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B33D3534-9854-416D-9412-CB4F732D0410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol.,International Rel.&amp;Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A153974-B803-439F-95AD-724028C45340</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Security Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
