National governments are concerned about the financial implications of this. In particular, the extent to which states can provide services and support through public transfers of funds. This raises further concerns about the equity of transfers away from a declining younger generation toward a growing older generation. There are significant debates to be had around the level of taxes, availability of benefits, and age of retirement. 

This however addresses only half of the issue, and ignores the private transfers that take place within families. The transfer of private wealth (and in-kind support) is increasingly important not only for the life chances of younger generations but also the protection of older ones. Younger people's opportunities are increasingly dependent upon the level of assistance they receive as they face key life events (such as education, starting a family and home ownership). Furthermore, as limited public resources are stretched, support from families has (once again) become an important aspect for older people as an insurance against poverty and increased care needs. 

Much current works focuses on this 'generational conflict' - whether transfers happen, and which direction they operate: a public focus on upward transfers (from younger to older generations) or a private focus on downward transfers (from parents to children and grandchildren). But little research considers the implications of these transfers for the reproduction of inequalities and the welfare and wellbeing of future societies. 

The issue of transfers across and within generations is thus an emerging and growing area of concern at national and international level, but much research has concentrated on single countries. Comparative research is developing, however, there are still restrictions due to data availability; a focus on western developed nations; and lack of funds/resources to build and develop connections with other scholars.

Institutional, policy and cultural differences exist across individual nations, however, the nature and need for inter- and intra-generational transfers is universal. This new network of researchers will bring together expertise in the field, share current knowledge and importantly identify key gaps in understanding. The INTEGRATE Network will have a specific purpose of developing international research, and maintaining international links for the continued sharing and exchange of data, research and knowledge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposal is ambitious in nature, and will take us into unknown territory. This approach whilst having some risks, does give rise to potentially greater impact than maintaining the status quo. Through developing new, multi-disciplinary, international connections, the network and potential future research, will be in a position to contribute to the diversity of social science impact, including: better informed public policy and decision making; different ways of thinking about the social and economic problems arising from the worldwide economic crisis, population ageing, growing inequalities; and the transmission of poverty and wealth across generations. INTEGRATE will draw on participants' established networks with a range of influential non-academic stakeholders and through these connections will draw in a wider group of beneficiaries from policy, user groups and commercial settings.

Beneficiaries of this work include international policy and regulatory bodies (for example the European Commission's Department of Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, UNDESA, WHO, UNRISD, ILO). Organisations and networks which promote the interests of older people (for example Age Platform Europe, AGEUK, HelpAge International) and younger people (for example UK's Intergenerational Foundation, and Youth for Europe) . More knowledge on intergeneration transfers and generation cooperation and conflicts is of key importance for policy makers at all levels of the government (including for example DFID, DWP, DCLG). Policy-makers would benefit from better knowledge of the role inter-generational transfers play in the spatial accumulation of wealth on the one hand, and the spatial concentration of poverty on the other. Such concerns address mechanisms operating on both a meso- and micro-level and would provide valuable local and national knowledge affecting issues ranging from urban planning through to fiscal policy. 

The future of welfare states and how ideas of welfare and fairness might change overtime must recognise the contribution of private wealth and strategies. Better understanding of the mechanisms through which intergenerational transfers affect the process of social stratification (and challenge ideals of meritocracy and equality of opportunity) could provide the basis for fairer and more efficient tax systems. It is a great challenge for policy makers to take into account the interest of different generations. But our aim is also to raise the profile of the implications of generational transfers in public debates. This is not just through producing evidence of the giving and receiving of resources, but importantly to give voice to those who may be caught in the middle (supporting older parents and adult children); those who do not have access to family resources; and those who do not have access to any resources. 

The network and future research will also have an impact in the commercial private sector. Developers and real estate brokers would benefit from better knowledge of the role the inter-generational transfers play in housing careers of younger and future generations. This understanding would feed into decisions of housing supply for potential future clients. More knowledge is also of key importance for the financial industry and their product innovations. New products may be necessary to facilitate new strategies of distributing/spreading wealth over different generations. Beneficiaries will also include organisations that represent key areas of industry (for example in respect of the transfer of housing wealth, the European Mortgage Federation and the UK's Council for Mortgage Lenders). 

The network may also have impact in the third sector. Charities and socially oriented NGO's would benefit from better knowledge of the role the inter-generational transfers (or lack of the inter-generational transfers) plays in development of social deprivation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18848</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J019259/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>FDC62639-4757-43E3-8BDC-C1DBBE90A2B5</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J019259/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>25152.11</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>30331096-DF76-48ED-B094-7ADD45DEA180</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J019259/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>18848.43</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1D32A760-9B88-43D4-8BDA-F0236A67470A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
