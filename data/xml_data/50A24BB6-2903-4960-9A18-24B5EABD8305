The Invisible College (IC) project generated considerably more material than initially expected. This includes a substantial quantity of photos, video, audio, talks, drawings, writings and objects gathered during the three workshops on site at Kilmahew/St. Peter's. This large data set has been used in several project outputs (e.g. research presentations, project website, an exhibition, an audio 'drift', a guided multimedia walk for the RGS-IBG), but it has the potential to be used and disseminated much more widely beyond the lifespan of the project, both by academics, our partner organisation NVA, and the various wider communities with an interest or stake in the site (e.g. local residents, artists, architects, writers, students). However, this will require some additional work (by team members Gallagher, and Lorimer) to collate, catalogue and order the data to make it accessible for future users. The extension of funding will enable the research team to:

 Edit together slides and audio recordings from six invited public presentations given over the course of the project. These will then be uploaded to YouTube and disseminated via the project website and other networks. All the talks were of high quality, and deserve to be made available to a wider audience in an accessible format.
 Gather any 'missing' data, e.g. by soliciting further submissions of materials from workshop participants; interviews with a few further key informants where this is a time imperative due to age/infirmity.
 Clean up some of the media gathered in preparation for archiving, e.g. removing noise from a small number of key audio recordings.
 Sort, annotate and catalogue materials to form the beginnings of a Kilmahew archive, consisting of both digital media and physical artefacts.
 Make simple arrangements for access to this material, including read-only hard drives based at the University of Glasgow (for access by academics), NVA (for access by artists) and Cardross library (for access by local communities and visitors to the site).

2. During the inaugural year of the IC, members of a local community Landscape Group have led efforts to transform a significant portion of the estate's former walled garden from overgrown scrubland to communal productive growing space and gathering area. This offshoot group has named itself and the space the Kilmahew Productive Garden. As an example of Community-Centred Action Research, the labour has been collaborative and creative, involving project team members, NVA (non-HEI project partner) staff, IC workshop participants and The Conservation Volunteers (TCV). Through the efforts of the combined volunteer sessions, ground has been cleared, beds have been dug and maintained, vegetable crops grown and harvested, and food shared. This is a properly substantive outcome and the first significant example of positive environmental change on the site in several decades. As a consequence the garden has generated real symbolic meaning and a strong sense of ownership and investment. To keep the weeds at bay and to capitalise on local reserves of enthusiasm, direction and purpose can be given to a new gardening season for 2013. An experimental growing programme is planned, drawing inspiration from 2 texts discovered during research by the local community Heritage Group: a published flora survey of the Kilmahew Estate from the late 19th century (Hennedy 1878), and a publication on soft fruit growing and associated weather recording created by the Head Gardener from the late Victorian era (Fleming 1872). The vision for growing historically relevant species on site will be introduced in community meetings, involving Landscape and Heritage groups, and carried out through a cycle of activities for the 2013 growing season. Thus, the extension of funding through continued partnership activities with a non-HEI collaborator will enable the research team to:

 deepen the bond of trust established between local community members and the project team during activities taking place in 2012
 enable, through the IC website, the Invisible College network to continue to communicate its on-site activities 
 build on the Invisible College ethos of learning-through-doing
 make more sustainable the life of the walled garden by involving the IC network
 keep the walled garden accessible to local user groups and visitors to Kilmahew Estate
 ensure the sustainability of the Kilmahew Productive Garden as a new local growing space, in the short-term, by engaging current volunteers, and attracting others from the area to join the activities
 enable the local Heritage and Landscape groups to share information found through research, experiment with growing techniques by revisiting earlier episodes of gardening history through the growing season, and add to their knowledge through site visits to other projects 
 record and document the seasonal progress, resulting in a Harvest Fair held on site
 create links and share information with local Gardens that have similar histories (Ardardan Nursery, National Trust for Scotland Geilston Garden) 
 research and trial an honesty box system in the Kilmahew Productive Garden, inviting inquisitive eaters and passers-by to pay a small amount for any produce tasted
