The project team, consisting of the PI, a full-time postdoctoral researcher and a project student, who will investigate the Old French translation of William of Tyre, will be based at Cardiff University, and will draw on existing resources and expertise in the Cardiff School of History and Archaeology.\nArchbishop William of Tyre (1175-1185) wrote a history of the crusades and the Frankish states in the East covering the period from the First Crusade (1095-99) to 1184. At some point in the early thirteenth century it was translated from the original Latin into French, and at various points later in that same century various French-language additions (the Continuations) were appended so as to bring the story up to date. The anonymous text, known from its nineteenth-century title as the Chronique d'Ernoul et de Bernard le Tr&amp;eacute;sorier, is an independent work in French covering the period from the First Crusade to 1229 or, in some manuscripts, to 1232; for the period 1184-1232 a version of this text formed the basis for the composition of the Continuations.\n The importance of the Continuations and Ernoul-Bernard is considerable. Together they constitute the fullest narrative for the events from 1184 until (in the case of one manuscript) 1277 in the territories in the Levant ruled by the crusaders, and they are the most significant historical works composed in the Latin East to describe these years. The interest of these texts lies partly in the historical information they contain, but also in their capacity to mirror the political and cultural preoccupations of the authors and the original audience.\n All historians of this period use the nineteenth-century editions these texts, and there is widespread agreement that a modern, scholarly edition is a major desideratum. Fifty-ne manuscripts of the French translation of William of Tyre dating from before 1500, forty-five of which contain Continuations, and eight manuscripts of Ernoul-Bernard survive, but the earlier editors utilized only a few of them, selected, so it would seem, largely at random. The editors had little idea of the stemma and no appreciation of how the texts developed.\nThe large number of manuscripts are in themselves a pointer to the importance of these texts in the middle ages, but their sheer bulk has hitherto deterred scholars from undertaking a project of these dimensions. These are substantial texts: Ernoul-Bernard is around 85,000 words long; the French translation of WT (to 1184) is somewhere in the region of 290,000 words, whilst the Continuations vary considerably in length with the longest amounting to ca. 120,000 words.\n The projected edition together with the PhD research on the text of the translation, a closely related but discreet topic, will form a natural extension of the PI's research into the French vernacular literature produced in the Latin East; in recent years this has included a preliminary investigation of the French translation of WT's Latin history, and the preparation of critical editions of the legal treatises by the thirteenth-century writers, John of Ibelin and Philip of Novara. This new edition will be used by historians of the crusades, by historians of medieval mentalit&amp;eacute;s and societies, and by specialists in Old French vernacular literature. It will also be of interest to specialists in Old French linguistics and philology.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>398057</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Constructing the Third Crusade</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:id>0A852A98-3CA5-40E6-B494-F929E3C3D5E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public lecture given to the Cardiff Centre for Lifelong Learning which included discussion of the findings of the project</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6228856617.7979640bb6fc3a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Constructing the Third Crusade</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:id>C81A8380-5DED-4655-8632-83F692875960</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A public lecture given to the Swansea branch of the Historical Association</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-456618760.206381560c114f14</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Old French translation of William of Tyre</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BF6F0E5B-25BC-496A-B649-EC6E6D83C7E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The holder of the project PhD studentship, Dr Philip Handyside, now has a contract with EJ Brill to publish a monograph bsed on his thesis</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8677237330.63530cb93e22</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sources for the 1191 conquest of Cyprus: Ernoul and Eracles revisited</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2AA0A61B-9099-4045-A13F-0F737D5DC274</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A public lecture given in the University of Cyprus, Nicosia.

1.The project has established the relationship between the various redactions of the texts known as the 'Chronicle of Ernoul and Bernard the Treasurer' and the 'Old French Continuatons of William of Tyre' (or 'Eracles'). Significant progress has been made towards preparing new editions of both works; in due course these editions will form the principal outcome.

2. Philip Handyside has investigated the Old French translation of William of Tyre, examining how the translation differed from the Latin original and how the text of the translation and the manuscript tradition developed. His thesis 'The Old French Translation of William of Tyre' was examined and approved in October 2012.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Although primarily intended for academic enquiry, the project will eventually have a 'trickle down' effect that will provide a better public understanding of the crusades in the middle ages.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4CDF8B81-270C-4576-AD06-49D2F6D85722</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-941531714.928831677951cf0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/><gtr:url>http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/share/research/projectreports/the-old-french-william-of-tyre-and-its-continuations.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>539836BB-8F6D-4063-836F-CA9A50AECEF1</gtr:id><gtr:title>La Chronique d'Ernoul&amp;nbsp;: probl&amp;egrave;mes et m&amp;eacute;thode d'&amp;eacute;dition1</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Perspectives m?di?vales</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/21b3f21ca1c61aba9290b02dc3e7d486"><gtr:id>21b3f21ca1c61aba9290b02dc3e7d486</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gaggero M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0880888e1fb2a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G010447/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
