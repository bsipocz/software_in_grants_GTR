Modern light weight philosophy and increased engine/generator output power often exacerbate the situation. The resulting vibrations increase fuel consumption unavoidably, which also results in increased emissions. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential to save up to 9.3 million tons of automotive CO2 emissions by reducing the effect of cyclic irregularities of internal combustion engines in automotive transmissions (Joachim et al. &amp;quot;How to minimize power losses in transmissions, axles and steerings&amp;quot;, VDI Gears 2011). The use of palliatives to suppress drivetrain vibrations increases the product cost. Furthermore, component wear and fatigue are other effects, adding to operational costs.
Passively controlled transfer of vibrational energy in coupled systems to a target, where the excess or residual energy eventually diminishes, is a - relatively - new concept called Targeted Energy Transfer (TET). It is based on imposing conditions upon nonlinear resonance between a primary source (the powertrain in this case) and a secondary system in order to achieve transfer of energy from one system to the other in an irreversible manner. The secondary system possesses essential stiffness nonlinearity, thus altering the global dynamics because of the lack of a preferential resonant frequency. Therefore, the latter can act as a Nonlinear Energy Sink (NES) over a broad range of excitation frequencies.
Thus, the overarching question in this proposal is &amp;quot;How can one design and develop a sustainable vibration reduction technology for powertrains using the modern TET research method?&amp;quot; This is undertaken with the view of maximising the benefits and limiting the costs to the UK plc, as well as the consumers. Currently, the automotive industry represents 9.2% of the total UK exports (source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders). 
The program of research is split into a number of work-packages in order to address the stated key-objective questions:
1. How can a TET mechanism be conceived for powertrain systems to effectively absorb/harvest the excess energy? Therefore, parametric models for scenario-building simulations will be developed to fundamentally understand the energy exchange mechanisms.
2. How much energy would be absorbed by the NES and under what input conditions? Is this method robust to typical variations (and uncertainties) in system parameters, initial conditions and external excitations encountered in powertrain dynamics? How do TET-based designs compare to alternative currently commercialised designs? The latter will be examined at component and system levels.
3. Could the TET mechanism be used for energy harvesting purposes in real powertrain systems?
4. Lastly, effort will be expended in closing the loop between the above questions and consolidating on practical methods of implementing the outcomes of 1-3 above in powertrains according to specific design objectives.
The collaboration between the different project partners will be tightly managed, so that the project objectives are achieved. The generated methods will be made available in the public domain. Automotive systems represent common operating features of powertrains across a variety of engineering applications. Hence, they have been selected for this fundamental generic research. The knowledge and experience accrued in this project can be expanded to a variety of large and small scale power transmission applications for vibration reduction, including aeronautics, marine, renewable energy (wind turbines) and micro-electro-mechanical systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of developing new technology for powertrain vibration reduction is generally difficult to quantify. The reduction of noise and adverse effects of incessant vibration have significant, though almost intangible social benefits. However, the optimised vibration-induced energy consumption in powertrains (conserving fuel energy) can be a major effect. This aim is crucial with the rising fuel cost and an imperative undertaking with the growing energy insecurity levels. The market trend to engine downsizing and improved fuel economy requires vibration palliatives that cost up to &amp;pound;65 per installed transmission (see GFT statement of support): dual mass flywheel, advanced torque converters, lock-up clutch and pendulum dampers. Recent studies have shown that optimised flywheels can reduce fuel consumption by up to 12% under regulatory and real-world driving conditions. In the renewable energy sector, advanced drivetrain technology can, on average, reduce the operational/maintenance cost by 7% and increase annual energy generation by 1-2% (source: NREL - USA). Should this new technology lead to benefits of the same order, there would be a significant financial benefit for the UK plc.
The above are just a few examples illustrating the outcome of improved energy efficiency in powertrains. Socio-economically, the project is expected to furnish the UK with unique niche capabilities in drivetrain engineering by developing novel concepts to improve fuel efficiency (via reducing powertrain vibration energy losses). Automotive systems have been selected as an application for this research due to the importance of this industry for the UK economy, since it represents 9.2% of the total UK exports and employs 720,000 people in the industrial arena. The project will support the following aspects of the UK's economy:
1. New commercial services for the supporting companies (Ford, Raicam and GFT). This vertically integrated consortium of vehicle, engine, drivetrain parts and transission manufacturers will accrue significant benefits either directly by using the research results or indirectly as a result of the synergies between them. Benefits such as drivetrain vibration reduction are not currently realised to their optimal potential. This project will deliver the tools to achieve this central aim and thus enable a holistic approach in assessing the market penetration of the new technologies. It will also allow direct quantification of the benefits in a more detailed manner than hitherto achieved. 
2. New or emerging industries. The project will highlight the effectiveness of applying the Targeted Energy Transfer (TET) method in automotive systems against unwanted operating conditions, supporting the UK drivetrain component industry to gain fundamental understanding of the commercial potential of investing in TET concepts. New products incorporating the proposed technological innovation can be developed with further R&amp;amp;D, including parts for use in hybrid drivetrains, where severe transient excitation conditions are encountered. The excess energy harvesting under nonlinear resonance can potentially lead to additional products that can be used to power auxiliary functions in drivetrains.
3. Other research areas. The knowledge and experience accrued in this project will be of a generic nature, enabling it to be expanded into a variety of large and small scale power transmission applications for vibration reduction, including aeronautics, marine, renewable energy (wind turbines), micro-electro-mechanical systems, to name but a few. 
The project will also provide answers for key decision makers in the various companies involved with drivetrain technology. The impact will be enhanced technology tools for achievement of maximum accrued benefits to the UK plc. One needs to be prudent in stipulating or quantifying the impact of the proposed research, but the consortium is convinced of a significant commercial impact of the proposed undertaking.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>514747</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Getrag Ford Transmissions</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Getrag</gtr:description><gtr:id>E18B9B00-412F-43B2-9717-8EE6DE867B98</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Feedback was provided on the powertrain operating conditions and potential NVH issues that could affect the performance of the nonlinear vibration absorbers (component and system levels).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e01756581b96.54781873-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>- Staff time for meetings</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The feedback of the industrial partner is taken into account during the development of the numerical models of the drivetrain with nonlinear absorbers at component and system levels.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with UIUC</gtr:description><gtr:id>308CD705-17A4-433B-8834-F70673D626B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Feedback was provided on the numerical simulations and experimental results and advice on ways to improve the effectiveness of the pre-tested concepts of the nonlinear vibration absorbers (component and system level models).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0195c7de7f4.02335959-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Regular (biweekly) audio meetings and review of the numerical simulation and experimental results</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Numerical simulations of component and system level drivetrain models equipped with nonlinear absorbers, using the methods developed in the Linear and Nonlinear Dynamics and Vibrations Laboratory.

? A state-of-the-art research method for vibration reduction in automotive powertrains was developed (Targeted Energy Transfer - TET) with the view of building a sustainable technology base. The successful implementation (and validation of the method) in a real system is an ongoing task. This requires to assessing the capabilities of energy transfer from the primary oscillating system (powertrain) to an attached secondary system vibration absorber (Nonlinear Energy Sink - NES), where the excess (residual) energy will either be localised (consumed/absorbed) or harvested.
? Significant new knowledge was generated: 1. Numerical models of automotive drivetrains were developed for studying TET at component (lower complexity) and system levels. The models are of parametric nature for scenario-building simulations to fundamentally understand the energy exchange mechanism between the primary system and the absorber. 2. The amount of energy which can be absorbed by the NES and the operating conditions of the powertrain under which it takes place have been estimated. 3. Practical methods for designing pre-tested conceptual NES vibration absorbers have been conceived at a preliminary stage, attempting to answer the following questions: where in a powertrain system can TET be introduced and which NES designs are compatible to the design criteria for such systems? 4. The robustness of the methodology to typical changes (and uncertainties), including variations in system parameters, initial conditions and external excitations was examined using the numerical models.
? Based on the above new knowledge, physical prototypes of the nonlinear absorbers were designed and manufactured. These will be used in an automotive powertrain rig to examine the effect on reducing drivetrain torsional oscillations.
? The above mentioned research methods and generated new knowledge were the result of a noteworthy research collaboration established between the industrial partners (Ford, Raicam Clutch and Getrag-Ford Transmissions) and the academic partners (Loughborough University and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Industry is guiding the work programme, ensuring that the research outcomes represent a realistic approach for industrial application.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research will be presented at national events (e.g. IMechE Conferences). Internationally, presentations will be made at leading events, such as EUROMECH / ASME Conferences. The research will also be disseminated in prestigious technical events, such as the Aachen Colloquium and the ISNVH Automotive Conference.
In August 2015 there was a 'state-of-the art' presentation in the Ford Technical Centre - Dunton in terms of the Global Clutch and DMF Reliability Council - Technical Design Review Meetings (TDRM). The consortium explained the project ideas to a group of industrialists (including suppliers), providing community input into the directions of the work. 
One further workshop will be held towards the end of the project (a detailed dissemination workshop) for specific user groups of the new technology, such as powertrain engineers and designers. These are the target groups, specific to various industrial sectors, thus ensuring maximum impact. Attempts will be made to connect this event to the IMechE workshops. Exploitation through IMechE divisions (Automobile, Aerospace) will be actively sought to ensure that all aspects of this work impact on the business of the UK plc.
It is expected that Ford and GFT will utilise the outcomes for developments of their product portfolio and Raicam Clutch will develop a service based on the modelling
