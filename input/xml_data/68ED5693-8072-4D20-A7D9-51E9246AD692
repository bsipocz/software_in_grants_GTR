resistance</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M027333/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing challenge, not only in the context of healthcare but also in, for example, food safety and agriculture. The prevalence of resistant bugs such as MRSA has received widespread media coverage and the problems relating to resistance are now more widely recognised than ever before, as is the importance of developing new approaches, particularly given the increase in issues associated with multidrug resistant species. The current proposal seeks to drawn on wide-ranging applicable expertise in engineering and the physical sciences that, in collaboration with biological-science researchers, clinicians and industry, offers hitherto unexploited opportunities to contribute significantly to addressing these very significant challenges.

We shall accordingly deliver a programme of activities that promotes new interdisciplinary collaborations across traditional boundaries between engineering, the physical sciences and the biological sciences. The University of Nottingham has an outstanding history of such discipline-bridging activities, as well as of research relevant to AMR, and will bring this experience to bear upon the challenge of AMR. 

The primary mechanism for promoting new research collaborations will be that of themed Sandpits, building on the success of the Mathematics-in-Medicine Study Groups pioneered by the University in 2000 (and subsequently spawning the Mathematics-in-the-Plant-Sciences Study Groups and others). In these, presenters from the biological sciences, clinical medicine or industry will describe issues that could benefit from new approaches drawn from engineering and the physical sciences; intensive brain-storming work on these topics will identify the skills needed and establish the relevant cross-disciplinary teams; seed funding will then be provided for the most promising projects identified. While the process is now well-established, the outcomes of such workshops are very far from predictable and the aggregation of the range of disciplines outlined above should ensure that innovative approaches come to the fore. Other mechanisms will include Challenge Days (modifying the successful approach of the Industry Challenge Days held by the Business School to ensure that research developments align with the needs of potential end users), discipline-hopping secondments, speed-networking sessions, cross-disciplinary workshops (focussing on specific methodologies, to enhance further the opportunities for identifying potential crossovers between research fields) and annual showcases in the form of a launch event and a concluding 'forward-look' workshop. These activities will be augmented by a Visiting-Scholar programme whereby leading experts in complementary areas will contribute their expertise to the initiative.

Funding from the programme will be assigned in competition to multidisciplinary projects judged on their research excellence and their capacity to contribute to addressing AMR challenges. The programme's Strategy Group will be responsible for assessing applications and for monitoring progress; the activities outlined above are specifically designed (in particular by bringing together researchers from diverse disciplines) to ensure that the research ideas developed are highly innovative and that the associated projects have the required mix of research expertise. The programme will be very explicitly outward-facing, drawing extensively on input from clinicians, industrialists and other potential end users, as well as interacting with complementary research elsewhere. In combination with the excellence and innovation of the research developed, such collaborations will ensure the sustainability of the initiative.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work in this programme, and that subsequently pursued as a consequence of the developments that it enables, have the scope to impact in numerous contexts, including in advancing diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of clinicians, in improved understanding of environmental factors, in associated developments of interest to a range of industries and in a greater public awareness of factors that contribute to antimicrobial resistance (particularly in perhaps less understood areas such as overuse in farming practices). Such impacts will produce a variety of benefits.

1. Economic benefits - for example to the pharmaceutical industry with respect to improved treatments (for example in new targets, better understanding of the pathways, improved delivery), to medical-device companies (such as through developing improved antimicrobial coatings for medical devices) and to the farming industry (notably in terms of improved procedures for disposal and decreased reliance on antibiotics for livestock feed).

2. Social benefits - any advances in tackling the AMR challenge would have positive effects on society, in particular education over misuse and disposal of antibiotics and on key issues that are less publicised such as understanding the importance of the setting (environmental factors).

3. Health benefits - better diagnostics would allow the more rapid detection and appropriate treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections and the development of better understanding would lead to more effective treatments, as well as ones less likely to increase the spread of resistance. Such impacts will be of benefit not just to human health: there are broader implications for animal health that should be enhanced through work with the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, with the University Farm and with water companies and other organisations involved in waste disposal.

4. Environmental benefits - improvements in the disposal of antibiotics and in the treatment of water and waste post-disposal would bring about a number of environmental benefits, for example in water cleanliness and soil quality. Decreasing reliance on antibiotics in livestock farming would also contribute to a healthier environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>491232</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of KwaZulu-Natal</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>AMR in the environment</gtr:description><gtr:id>760507EF-A6A5-4AA9-9FA4-BFB7DF061035</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary - Mathematics, Biosciences, Vet Sci, Environmental microbiology.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b5a87ad4f1f6.88339954-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Sharing of unpublished results, collaboration on Nottingham projects and joint grant applications being composed to external funders.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Visiting scholars (see events entries) and ongoing collaborations on projects such as &amp;quot;geospatial modelling the spread of AMR in the environment&amp;quot;.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Poznan University of Medical Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Poland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Assessment of a polymer-based nanoparticulate system to enhance drug delivery of lactoferrin to prevent C. difficile infection</gtr:description><gtr:id>9D85DC44-A53C-412A-801B-7A75D26BB2D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See above.

Each event has triggered novel AMR questions, some of which researchers are seeking to answer through pump prime grants. The grant has been successful in educating a large number of researchers in beginning to understand the priority areas in AMR, especially as a result of interactions with NHS and veterinary clinicians and industrial partners. External collaborations are increasing and in-depth relationships are developing with NHS colleagues, policymakers and industry representatives. Additionally the grant is allowing development of early career researchers via event opportunities (including AMR club) and via pump prime grants allowing them to explore novel ideas that may otherwise find it difficult to obtain external funding. Undergraduate students have been presented with similar opportunities to upskill and explore novel research ideas with the support of supervisors. Individual pump prime outcomes achieved thus far are included in the main body of this report.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This is largely pump-prime grant dependent, with new techniques, tools and datasets all being relevant in further scientific enquiry. It is hoped that some developments e.g. those in POC devices, patient warming process changes, treatment of animal bedding, may eventually have direct impacts on patients, treatment of animals, best economic options for farmers and animal health, behaviour of the general public etc. Some pump prime grants are beginning to show these impacts already but the level of this is not yet suitable for formal reporting. However, there are clear signs that research such as the development of patient warming tools is beginning to be implemented and is having an impact on local NHS patient treatment.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8966BD8F-94D8-43E6-9A0F-FB9116BC3AB3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b1cae577b836.68491229</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Improving surgical site infection prevention practices</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>53A70835-9CEF-4FC2-AD4B-C268D7FC3A40</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b6bbb00fb4c3.70003791</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Metagenomic data sets, identification of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacterial populations.</gtr:description><gtr:id>621C8F88-285B-4CFB-A201-86F95296064C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A at this early stage in the research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6b839d56fb4.31742984</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The role of sheep in the transmission of AMR between farms and between environments</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Collection of wastewater and stream water and exploration of resistant strains.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA99A5AD-C4AF-4BCD-BCAB-48A22D0C6A02</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To be used in further funding applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9482cb21688.26627496</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Antibiotic and metal ion resistance genes in E. coli isolated from a wastewater treatment plant</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Tracking resistance levels in fresh slurry, and post process dry and liquid fractions.
