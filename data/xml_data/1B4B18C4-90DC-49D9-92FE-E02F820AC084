It is thinning sufficiently rapidly along its outlet glaciers to contribute an estimated 0.75 mm/yr to global sea level rise. About half of that signal is a result of an increase in the amount of melting over the surface of the ice sheet in summer, while half has come from acceleration in the flow of a number of major outlet glaciers that drain ice from the interior of the ice sheet directly into the ocean. While the increase in melting has been caused by changes in atmospheric conditions over the ice sheet surface, the latter process is less well understood. The acceleration of the glaciers appears to be linked to changes at the downstream end, where the glaciers come into contact with the ocean. At times in the past, the larger glaciers appear to have had short tongues of floating ice at their termini, and recent thinning or break-up of those tongues seems to have precipitated the accelerations. It is generally assumed that the thinning and retreat of the floating ice tongues was triggered by some change in the oceanographic conditions within the fjords into which the glaciers drain. However, prior to the recent changes almost nothing was known about the oceanography of the fjords, so although observations are now beginning to be made, we can only guess at what the fjords looked like when the floating tongues were intact, and how the fjord waters and floating ice interacted. At present there are only a couple of floating ice tongues of any size that still survive, and that still seem to be in something close to a steady state. It is crucial that we make observations of those fjords and glaciers now, while they still exist, so that we can learn about the physical processes that must have played a role in the destruction of those that have been lost in recent years, and so that should a similar fate befall the few survivors in future we will be able to say with certainty what changes led to their destruction. Improving our knowledge of the interaction between the floating ice tongues of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the seawater within the fjords in which they float, and in particular developing our skills in modelling these systems, will be a major step towards understanding what controls the pace and ultimate extent of the changes currently underway in Greenland's outlet glaciers.

This project forms part of an intensive observational research campaign focused on ocean-ice shelf interactions in Petermann Fjord, the site of a major outlet glacier, Petermann Glacier, draining northwest Greenland. Most of the fjord is still covered by a 55-km long floating ice tongue, which forms both the primary interest in the region and the largest obstacle to detailed observations of the fjord. The collaborative, interdisciplinary effort consists of coordinated ocean and glacier studies conducted by groups at two UK and five US institutions plus international partners from Canada and Denmark. The unique contribution of this particular project is to determine the shape of the ocean cavity beneath the floating ice tongue and the distribution of water properties within it. The key tool with which the necessary observations will be made is an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (Autosub3), configured and run in a manner analogous to that used for an earlier, highly successful campaign in which it completed 500 km of along-track observations beneath the 60-km long floating tongue of Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. A detailed understanding of the ocean circulation and melting beneath Petermann Glacier will generate insight into ocean-ice interactions that will be relevant to many other sites in Greenland and Antarctica, and will advance our developing knowledge of ice sheet discharge and its future effect on sea-level rise.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of this research will have an impact beyond the academic community. Beneficiaries from this broader community include:

1) UK and international policy makers concerned with the impacts of climate change and their mitigation.
The primary vehicle for communication of the outcomes of climate change research to policy makers is the series of Assessment Reports produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The results of this project will be published in time to influence the writing of the Sixth Assessment Report.

2) Professionals working outside of academia who are engaged in research and innovation.
The field observations undertaken within this project involve the deployment of cutting edge technology in a hostile environment. Lessons learnt will be of broad interest in the offshore survey and robotics industries. The nature of the field work and the outcomes will be described in an article in Projects magazine, one of the main vehicles for the broader dissemination of academic research work within Europe.

3) The UK Met Office.
While the climate model development teams at the Met Office are academic beneficiaries, the Climate, Cryosphere and Oceans group have specific needs that will be addressed more directly than is possible via the usual routes of publications and conference presentations used to communicate results to academics. At present they are working on coupling an evolving ice sheet model with the atmosphere and ocean component models being developed within HadGEM3. Our developments of MITgcm will be transferable to the ocean component, NEMO, and we will visit the Met Office to assist in this work. The aim will be to complete this in time for the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report model runs.

4) Postgraduate students and early career scientists.
The environmental sciences need to attract the very best of the next generation of physical scientists to meet the challenges presented by the need to understand our changing climate. The combination of cutting edge technology, a remote and pristine natural environment and the exploratory nature of the work proposed here should provide suitable inspiration to attract promising young people to the environmental sciences. The outcomes of this research will be incorporated into lectures given at undergraduate and postgraduate level.

5) General public.
The challenges of working in remote and hostile environments, and the powers of modern technology, are themes that often generate interest in the general public. These elements of the work proposed here should help to draw a very wide audience to an awareness of the outcomes of this research. Our primary means of communicating with the general public will be through the BAS press office, and we would aim to raise public awareness of change in the Greenland Ice Sheet and increase the general level of understanding about the key drivers of that change.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>346117</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/J023108/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>45</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>07B1BD3F-A7ED-4640-8B09-C1F296DC56BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Glacial &amp; Cryospheric Systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>723BA0F8-3ECD-4E2A-A39E-44936EAC1517</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>45</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean Circulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
