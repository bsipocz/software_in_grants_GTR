universalism through administrative data research</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/P002293/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>A recent public health strategy published by the Department of Health, Social Services &amp;amp; Public Safety entitled 'Fit and Well - Changing Lives (2012-2022)' [1] has shown that people with a learning disability (LD) represent one of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in Northern Ireland (NI). In fact evidence shows that those with a LD across the United Kingdom (UK) are more likely to experience major illnesses, to develop them earlier, and die of them sooner than the population as a whole [2]. Furthermore, even with such a worrying health profile, the LD population is less likely to get some of the evidence-based annual health checks and treatments they need, and continue to face real barriers in accessing services [1] [3]. Most alarming however is the apparent invisibility of LD. Evidence suggests that such inequity often exists and persists among this population because they remain unseen [4]. 

At present there is no central register detailing the actual number of individuals with LD in NI. As a consequence it is not possible to evaluate the form, context or degree of inequality that may be experienced by this group. This in turn makes it impossible to tailor or to target services or to monitor health in terms of health inequalities for this population. Recently, a 'Research and Information Service Paper' submitted to the Northern Irish Assembly [9] noted that &amp;quot;...according to a review by Marmot in 2010 [10], health inequalities are avoidable and socially unjust...[and]...in order to reduce the steepness of the social gradient in health...actions must be universal, but with a scale and intensity proportionate to the level of disadvantage. Therefore, policies and strategies should target action at those experiencing greater social and economic disadvantage. This approach is termed 'proportionate universalism' [11] and it requires multi-agency working across local and central government, and the voluntary and private sectors&amp;quot; [12].

To begin to pursue and achieve proportionate universalism for the LD population of NI, a multi-disciplinary team comprising academic researchers from Ulster University (UU), University of Bristol (UofB) and senior representatives from the Public Health Agency (PHA), the Health and Social Care Trusts (HSCTs) the statutory sector (ARC, Positive Futures) and a LD service user group (COMPASS) aim to exploit, link and maximise the use of existing NI administrative data to (i) begin to expose, exploit and explore LD records wherever they reside in existing Northern Irish (NI) administrative datasets (ii) begin to consider best practice in, and strategize for, the future recording and identification of LD in NI (iii) formulate guidelines to tailor, target and implement support for individuals with LD across NI and (iv) establish an administrative data evidence base upon which to build future research, facilitate future data sharing and enable ongoing action to reduce the health inequalities faced by the LD population in NI. Specifically the study aims to (i) provide a geographical map of LD in NI using available Census data; (ii) profile the demography of the LD population using a range of socio-economic metrics; (iii) profile morbidity and comorbidity of health care problems among the LD population using the Enhanced Prescribing Database and Census health metric data; (iv) exploit NI Mortality data to explore the causes and contexts of death among the NI LD community and (v) stimulate and facilitate 'proportionate universalism' across the region through multi-agency collaboration across local and central government, and the voluntary and private sectors. While the LD population and the project's non-academic partners, the statutory (PHA and NHSCT) and voluntary (ARC, Positive Futures, COMPASS) sectors, will be the primary beneficiaries of the research, the team will also strongly influence how policy is commissioned, and how health care and health promotion services are delivered.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
The project team are committed to engaging with key stakeholders in the areas of community public health (primary care &amp;amp; acute healthcare, health improvement/promotion), and national policy with the primary aim of reducing health inequalities for the LD population. While the LD population and the projects non-academic partners, the statutory (PHA and NHSCT) and voluntary (ARC, Positive Futures, COMPASS) sectors, will be the primary beneficiaries of the research, the team will also strongly influence how policy is commissioned, and how health care and health promotion services are delivered for the LD population. It is now a legal duty within the UK under the Disability Discrimination Acts (1995, 2005) and the Equality Act (2010) for primary and secondary services to make reasonable adjustments to ensure equality of access to healthcare (Disability Rights Commission, 2006). The proposed project therefore will also be of particular interest to a wide range of government departments, trusts and clinical disciplines (public health researchers, epidemiologists, policy makers, service providers, acute &amp;amp; primary healthcare, health promotion &amp;amp; improvement teams, learning disability services, statutory and voluntary sectors, etc.). Project members are also committed to sharing project knowledge with all ADRC-NI partners on completion of the project.
How will they benefit? 
Non-academic statutory and voluntary partners will ensure that the analytic process and findings will directly inform targeted public health, health promotion, primary healthcare, acute healthcare, clinical and national policy level interventions. Involvement and representation from both statutory and voluntary organisations, as well as service user group representation affords a valuable and unique opportunity to pursue and achieve proportionate universalism for the LD population of NI. The following proposed outputs have been planned to maximise and ensure impact. A project website and social media account will be created. These will provide a public and accessible 'audit trail' of how administrative data can be accessed and used to facilitate change in policy and practice. Specific consideration will be given to non-academic bodies and service users in the design of the website. A targeted intervention strategy for delivering focussed, context sensitive social health promotion and healthcare across NI will be formulated by the project team identifying the reasonable adjustments that can be made to community, primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services including health promotion/screening. Using the project findings the team will target services to 'high-risk' areas across NI. A summary report and pathways to policy document will be compiled and sent to the ADRC-NI, the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister in NI, Regional Group on the Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing on Learning Disabilities and the Bamford Group on Learning Disabilities. On completion of the analyses the team will organise a knowledge exchange conference to ensure that project findings are effectively communicated to all stakeholders highlighting the reasonable adjustments that can be made to community, primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services. The conference will be promoted and advertised through all stakeholders. One of the primary roles of all stakeholders is to support policy development which has wider connections with the voluntary sector, the Assembly, government departments, practitioners and academics. Importantly, this event will bring statutory and voluntary service providers together to discuss the pursuit/achievement of proportionate universalism for the LD population while clearly addressing the many inequalities that this population so frequently face. Finally a series of peer-reviewed publications will be produced and an ADRC-NI workshop will be organised to discuss data access, linkage, analysis and impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>155303</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P002293/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1D32A760-9B88-43D4-8BDA-F0236A67470A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51E91F17-25CD-4FBD-917E-1BD82B72BDB9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical &amp; Statistic Psych</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
