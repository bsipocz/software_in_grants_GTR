The award will allow me to embark upon a final phase of analysis of certain hagiographical and cartulary sources (which I will already have acquired) in order to produce the remaining chapters of the monograph. \n\nThis monograph represents the first comprehensive study (in any language) of sanctity and pilgrimage in medieval southern Italy, and will contribute to a deeper understanding both of the region as it moved through profound transitions, and also of the medieval wide development of sanctity and pilgrimage. As the region was unique in sheltering Greek Christian, Latin Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities, this study represents a rare chance to attempt a holistic analysis of a politically and culturally fragmented land which acted as a Mediterranean frontier for the major religious groups of the medieval world, and to analyse how sanctity functioned at such a key cultural crossroads. It also offers the opportunity to compare sanctity in a liminal zone with other forms throughout Europe thus addressing further the true extent of Southern Italy's perceived marginality in the medieval world. The region, in the Middle Ages and to some extent still today, has typically been viewed as marginal to the deeper currents of European events. \n\nThe research incorporated within this project has involved the acquisition, translation and analysis of a diverse, but complementary, body of primary material (both published and unpublished). The major sources for this study are medieval hagiographical texts, in the form of saints' biographies and miracle collections. Medieval liturgical works have also been utilised, such as sanctoral calendars, martyrologies, exultet rolls and lectionaries. These reveal how saintly cults were venerated in an official format by the Church, and how they were presented to the wider lay community. This study also incorporates a vast range of material from cartularies (revealing information on bequests to saints and church dedications to particular saints), contemporary medieval chronicles (revealing the social and political contexts in which sanctity functioned) and visual material (architecture and decoration).\n\nAmong its key conclusions the work emphasises that Southern Italy should be placed more to the centre rather than the periphery of many core medieval developments, a finding which carries wider consequences for our understanding of medieval Europe as well as modern-day Italy. The region could be termed a 'holy crossroads', one which played a pivotal role in the growing internationalism of sanctity. The unique environment in southern Italy created a melting pot for a variety of forms of sanctity with diverse cultural traditions, and venerated by equally diverse individuals and communities. Southern Italy and its models of sanctity represent an illuminating example of the propensity for imitation (with other forms of sanctity across Europe), integration and cross-cultural exchange. It also concludes, therefore, that an analysis of south Italian sanctity and pilgrimage can map the erosion of the region's internal frontiers through growing Latinisation and homogenisation. As a corollary to this, another important finding concludes that an exploration of sanctity in the South uncovers significant transitions in South Italian society (the re-Christianisation of Sicily, the nature of the apparent rupture between the region's Latin and Greek communities, the increasing influence of the Papacy, urbanisation, the rise of eremetical and monastic movements).\n\nThis study will be of particular value to academics and students interested in the medieval Mediterranean, sanctity and pilgrimage, medieval Christianity, and interfaith relationships.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond the immediate circle of academic beneficiaries, the research emanating from this project will benefit other wider public groups. I intend to submit a paper (2-4,000 words in length), formed out of the research for this project, to the History and Policy website (http://www.historyandpolicy.org/index.html). This is an increasingly popular and influential forum with a broadening non-academic readership which 'demonstrates the relevance of history to contemporary policymaking'. It 'advises historians wanting to engage more effectively with policymakers and media' and offers expert comment on contemporary cultural trends. The paper will explore two inter-connected issues of contemporary significance, by offering comparisons with earlier medieval developments. \n \nFirstly, it will examine how the emerging nature of medieval sanctity and pilgrimage can inform our understanding of recent patterns in spiritual belief within Britain (primarily) and Europe. The credit crunch and recent economic downturn are believed to have encouraged many to reflect on their core values, creating a revived interest in religion and the emergence of what sociologists have termed 'the fuzzy faithful'; a cohort who don't fully practice any faith, but acknowledge the importance of religion. While the Catholic Church in Britain has identified growing church attendances, it seems that this is not a revival on the level of the organised church, but on an individual spiritual one. There is increased evidence that more people are connecting with sacred places for the transcendental experiences they offer. Significant parallels and precedents for these developments and activities can be found in medieval sanctity and pilgrimage (the subject of my monograph); and which can provide valuable comparative evidence to reveal what this might mean for modern society, how these trends might develop in the future, and their wider consequences. The second connected issue to be explored in this paper will be the recent rise in popularity of holidays/travel which produce transformative and morally meaningful experiences. Again, indicative parallels can be made with the development of medieval pilgrimage which will allow a deeper appreciation of the contemporary social and cultural significance of this new trend. It is hoped that the paper could be written in the period immediately following submission of the monograph manuscript in September 2012, and (depending on the editorial process) published in 2013.\n \nAn alternative strategy (should the above paper not be accepted by History and Policy) would be to submit a similar paper (on the same timescale) to a popular history magazine such as BBC History Magazine, which has the specific aim of bringing historical research to a broad audience. I will approach the editors of the website or the magazine in early 2012, and it is hoped that the paper could be written in the period immediately following submission of the monograph manuscript in September 2012, and (depending on the editorial process) published in 2013.\n \nIn addition I intend to arrange a public lecture in which I could present a version of the paper described above to a local-community, and non-academic, audience. I have contacts at the Friends of the Manchester Centre for Regional History, a centre which is 'especially keen to encourage activities which bridge the gap between academic history and the wider public outside academic life, particularly through furthering its links with schools, colleges, local history organisations, museums, archives and libraries'. I will approach the Centre to offer a lecture at their Annual General Meeting in early 2012. Other alternative public lecture venues to be explored could be Chetham's Library, Manchester or the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire. An approach to one of these societies could be made in ear</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>57894</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A Bridge to Salvation or Entrance to the Underworld: international pilgrimage and medieval southern Italy</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6379EB74-2696-4C94-8AC2-69F1BCEDAE2E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1 hour talk delivered at the Department of History, University of Manchester research seminar.

In a society experiencing rapid and profound transitions old saints' cults were renewed and reconfigured to harmonize more appropriately with the present. In addition, southern Italy produced a range of new, contemporary saints, many of which espoused innovatory forms of spirituality and worship which were at the forefront of the more radical changes in the Western Church.



Some of the new forces which dictated the transitions in the make-up of South Italian sanctity in the Central Middle Ages were the rise of new secular powers (especially the infiltration of Normans into the region), Church reform, and urbanization. All were common phenomena throughout the rest of western Europe. 



However, where South Italian sanctity and pilgrimage differed markedly from its European counterparts was in its simultaneous interface with the Greek-Christian, Latin-Christian, and Islamic worlds. Here, it was at the vanguard of some of the great confrontations of the medieval world. The evolution of Greek-Christian saints in southern Italy, the worship of ancient eastern saints, and the dissemination through both of Greek-Christian spiritual ideals situated South Italian sanctity firmly at the heart of what was developing into the great schism between the Western and Eastern halves of the Christian Church, and showed that on a local, personalized level Greeks and Latins could cohabit the same spiritual and physical space. 



At the same time, in the conquest of Islamic Sicily by the Normans (c.1060-1091), South Italian saints and their cults were employed to re-Christianize a territory which significantly aided the expansion of the Latin-Christian frontier. Yet, the reserved nature of the cultic revival on Sicily suggests that acculturation and collaboration between Latin, Greek, and Arab-Islamic communities imparted a telling influence on the devotional map of Christian Sicily.



Finally, during the period from 1000 to 1200, Southern Italy (due largely to its crucial position at the heart of the Mediterranean and the rising popularity of pilgrimage/crusading) experienced a vastly increased influx of pilgrims to and through the region. It responded by developing significant pilgrimage infrastructures and services, and offering its own shrine centres to enrich the pilgrim's experience. In many respects, southern Italy thus acted as a bridge to salvation, enabling pilgrims/crusaders to reach their goals, and indeed it was the space in which many pilgrims perished and hoped to obtain eternal life. But, as ever, southern Italy presented its own unique paradoxes and challenges. For the region's traditions were composed of layers of supernatural, folkloric, classical and pagan histories which were linked to a landscape of earthquakes, volcanoes, subterranean spaces, and dangerous waters. According to some traditions, the entrance to the Underworld and to Purgatory could be located in southern Italy, and the growing number of travellers and pilgrims seemed to have eagerly disseminated this news back to the West. Southern Italy offered a veritable adventure theme park for the aspiring penitential pilgrim, its landscape charged with religious and eschatological power. 



Therefore, in the final analysis, through an examination of sanctity and pilgrimage, this project identified notable parallels between southern Italy and other zones of Western Europe, while simultaneously showing how it differed in significant ways too and suggesting some factors which explain why southern Italy has traditionally been viewed as 'different' from its European counterparts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project could be used to support museum/public exhibitions on medieval travel/tourism (through the project's examination of pilgrimage travel and relic collections) and/or on religious belief and cross-cultural contact in the Middle Ages. Likewise, these findings could be employed in an educational context, supplementing pre- and post-16 school/college work on medieval projects. 



The broader discussion on South Italian 'difference', which is at the core of this project, could also support and inform ongoing public debate on the disparities between North and South Italy (and likewise link into any school/college courses on modern Italy).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CD3B411E-FFCF-4C44-9C1D-3799BED2EC86</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5877861218.41320877637c2c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6915FC27-D03D-4AA7-974A-3938F8BA3A50</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sanctity and Pilgrimage in Medieval Southern Italy, 1000-1200</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dc738c8ba591be510ae95053fd489823"><gtr:id>dc738c8ba591be510ae95053fd489823</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Oldfield, P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1107000285</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>541948ca3c7ac0.97768090</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B78779B-432C-4BBB-9E46-6F4F700C0123</gtr:id><gtr:title>Medieval Tourism</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BBC History Magazine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dc738c8ba591be510ae95053fd489823"><gtr:id>dc738c8ba591be510ae95053fd489823</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Oldfield, P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9771469855067</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54194a4e9b0c46.04812142</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I022007/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
