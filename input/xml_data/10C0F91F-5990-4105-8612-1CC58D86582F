Dialogue</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K000322/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The Muslims, Trust and Cultural Dialogue research project analyses the conditions of intercultural trust and mistrust in three overlapping areas of modern life:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>politics and society&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>business and finance&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>art and culture. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The project is committed to understanding how existing practices in these fields enact dialogue and negotiation between groups in ways that can be mutually informative, and which help us move beyond misunderstanding and negative stereotyping. It is an international multidisciplinary network of scholars, practitioners and stakeholders exploring questions of trust in the relationship between Muslim diaspora populations in the West and the societies around them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our work employs a mix of methodological traditions: social and cultural theory, hermeneutics and textual close reading, and the qualitative analysis of data. It intersects with public debates about multiculturalism and intercultural dialogue and aims to explore how trust is created and can be nurtured: to empower groups utilising mechanisms of civic engagement; and to provide those involved in political and social policy-making with a better understanding of how trust and dialogue can make communication more informed and effective. Its findings are disseminated through international collaborations, scholarly publications, downloadable resources, live events, audio and visual media and the project website.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I have chosen to identify impact in part by correlating potential beneficiaries with the constituencies addressed by the project partners and planned events. For example, the Dialogue Society, with whom I am organising three roundtable sessions, is an established charity that has a remit to advance social cohesion by connecting communities. It is well connected in government and business and its work includes discussion forums, courses, capacity building publications and outreach. The proceedings of these roundtable events will be part of the Society's manuals for community organisations. Thus, our work will reach those end users - a combination of individuals and organisations - that commonly access and benefit from the Dialogue Society's work. 

Likewise, my collaboration with Engage will draw on their links with British Muslims and local communities. Engage is dedicated to improving the rates of civic participation, media involvement and political engagement by British Muslims. We will be drawing on this experience in setting the agenda for our conferences and seminars, and by working with Engage to produce the action packs on Islamic Finance which will be distributed to mosques, community groups and businesses in the London area, with the possibility of a broader geographical roll out later. These will be of interest to all those, whether in the public, private or third sector, who see potential in the establishment of parallel financial protocols in accord with Islamic principles: something of a growth area in the contemporary financial world.

In addition I will be participating in a short documentary film and discussion on the Islam Channel's 'Politics and Media' show on the project theme of trust and cultural dialogue. The Islam Channel's mission is to act as an interface between Muslims and non-Muslims to remove misconceptions and challenge stereotyping. The channel is available globally and on the Internet, and is broadcast to a hundred and thirty two countries around the world. This collaboration is likely to be key to the project effecting a global impact footprint.

The newly formed Centre for the Study of Pakistan at SOAS is a key partner in this project, organising seminars, providing central London venues, and participating in the photographic exhibition and its attendant events. It is a focal point for research and teaching on Pakistan from a range of disciplinary perspectives. With Pakistan often identified as a key area of 'global uncertainty' and its diasporic populations subject to ever more stringent scrutiny, the participation of the Centre will stimulate interest among expatriate Pakistanis and those with professional, economic or strategic interests in the region. (For example, contact has already been made with Gemma Thompson from the FCO's Community Engagement Unit, who has expressed an interest in the work.)

Access to policy makers and government agencies is a key part of the plan for impact. As well as the Dialogue Society, our efforts in this regard will be helped by our partnership with the Muslim Institute (through their new quarterly publication, Critical Muslim, for which I write). Critical Muslim aims to become the preeminent publication taking a critically interrogative approach to Muslim matters. Its high profile editor, Ziauddin Sardar is well-known as a polymath and influential communicator, with a significant international following.

Finally, impact on a wide range of users will be guaranteed by the interactive website, which will archive events, disseminate findings and provide an interactive discussion forum. The website will be preserved in the British Library's Web Archive to which we will be adding a number of other websites, building, for the first time, a collated set of online resources about Muslims, trust and dialogue in perpetuity for all kinds of users.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>324081</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>School of Oriental and African Studies (University of London)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>School of Oriental and African Studies</gtr:description><gtr:id>0AADB16B-0BDB-440C-8EFE-70F907DDB621</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Yaqin wrote an essay entitled 'Autobiography and Muslim Women's Lives' published in the Journal of Women's History (25:2, 2013).

Where that was concerned to examine the creation and marketing of Muslim writing in the UK and US, drawing in writers and publishers, this was a showcase for the work of a range of writers from around the world. As such, its audience tended more towards the general public, students and book lovers.

Writers from the UK, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Lebanon were invited to read from their work and discuss questions of cultural convergence and confluence and, specifically, whether literature can help build trust between communities. The readings were well received by a sizable audience who were also fully involved in the discussions that followed each reading. Topics covered included censorship and freedom of speech, cultural representation and the impact of international politics on literary production and reception.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd95cf033ca7.32937141</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.muslimstrustdialogue.org/index.php/arts-and-culture/171-homepage5-3</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Worhsop 'conversation' with invited stakeholders to discuss the impact of the Government's Prevent Duty on public bodies</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91150BDF-DCA8-4B2B-B4DE-0AE4D9900E96</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This half-day workshop 'conversation' involved stakeholders from professional bodies, third sector workers, policy officials, students, academics and others.

Around 50 delegates attended across the day, including civil servants, academics and those involved in deradicalisation and interfaith work. Our talk was well-received, generated questions, discussion, and subsequent breakout groups were able to further consider our findings and suggestions.

This workshop led directly to the publication of a related policy document (see 'Policy' section of form) in which a brief overview of our work and some summary recommendations were included. As the document has only just appeared impact is hard to gauge at this point.

The pictures are largely informal - although a few are symbolically staged - and serve to show the famous and the not-so-famous, providing a snapshot of Muslim life in Britain today.

This exhibition was staged in partnership with HRH Prince Charles' Mosaic Arts Trust. The launch evening in April was attended by over 100 people. During the time the exhibition was open it received over 7000 visitors, and several school visits. It was also the subject of a piece on the BBC London television news.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd93eb067685.99500537</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32863718</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Panellist in discussion on 'Muslims and Trust', Bradford Literature Festival, 16 May 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1C42FCC9-A4A1-452C-B163-8E4C16F43079</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 50 people attended the panel on Muslims and Trust which was part of the first annual Bradford Literature Festival (which itself aims to reach out across community dividing lines and bring together diverse audiences).

Using my project's research as a launchpad we discussed a range of general issues standing in the way of the promotion of trust between Muslims and non-Muslims in contemporary Britain.

While these are in preparation the work of MTCD is available via our two completed documentary films - 'Journey into Europe' and 'Migrations of Islam' and online resources housed on the project website. 

With regard to Professor Akbar S. Ahmed's work in partnership with us on the Journey into Europe project, the documentary based on the research has now been finished. Professor Peter Morey acted as executive producer for the film, which will in due course be followed by a book. As a distinguished academic and diplomat, Professor Ahmed has managed already to reach out to a wide audience. The film has played in numerous venues in the US, including the Ralph Bunche Library in the US State Department, where the audience was composed of experts and policy makers. Additional showings have taken place at the Cosmos Club, Washington DC; the William and Mary Global Film Festival, Virginia; and the Second Annual Muslim Film Festival, Milwaukee. In addition, there have been positive testimonials and reviews, including in the Saudi Gazette and Huffington Post. Professor Ahmed continues to promote and give interviews connected to the film. Professor Peter Morey introduced the inaugural UK screening at LSE in January. The film (and its tie-in book) will follow earlier works by Professor Ahmed in reaching government, diplomats, policy-makers and opinion formers in the months and years to come. 

I also recommend the documentary film produced as part of the project by our partners at the Michigan State University Muslim Studies Program (director Salah D. Hassan). This hour-long film 'Migrations of Islam' explores Muslim self-fashioning and intercultural trust in the Great Lakes area of the United States. It was premiered in Britain at our 'Beyond Islamophobia' conference in June 2014. Since then it has played at numerous documentary film festivals and conferences in the US including: East Lansing Film Festival; Queens International Film Festival, NY; Ethnogra Film Festival; and the World Documentary Conference. The film has received positive reviews from the audiences. Audiences have indicated that the film makes an important contribution to the understanding of the diversity of Muslim Americans and also the various ways that Muslims in the US express themselves. Some have emphasized the need for more films like Migrations of Islam that have a different focus, such as the issue of race and religion, especially given the large number of Black Muslims in the US and their specific histories. Others have commented on the importance of making a film that addresses specifically conversion to Islam among Americans. 

The photographic festival 'The Art of Intergration', featuring pictures by the renowned photographer Peter Sanders, ran as part of the project between April and June 2015. This was extremely successful, with more than 7000 visitors across the two month period it was open, including several school parties. It also generated regional press coverage on BBC London news (http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/06/22/towerhamlets_peter_video_feature.shtml) . Viewer reactions were captured in a Visitor Book. We are still collating these, but a number testify to raised levels of knowledge and changed attitudes as a result of seeing the exhibition.

Our work was cited in the PaCCS Policy Briefing, 'Religion and Contemporary Security' challenges (2016) with the recommendation that the arts and cultural forms of expression ought to form a more central plank in engagement between communities. Mention here was made of perhaps the most original facet of the work: scoping and devising a 'tool kit' for building intercultural trust. This has emerged in the final year of the project from the case studies our team has carried out with interfaith community arts group. We are evolving techniques based on shared goal-setting, collaborative interdependence and mutual vulnerability, as a potential model which can be rolled out on a larger scale to develop more trusting intercultural relations. This work draws on constructivist paradigms of building intercultural understanding, but develops them further by incorporating techniques from theatre practice and drama therapy. We envisage significant future impact from this as we research it further in subsequent projects. This has potential use in many areas where intercultural trust needs improving.

In the first post-award year (2016) MTCD co-organised a half-day conversation on the impact of the Prevent Duty on public bodies. This was a collaboration between the Universities of East London and Middlesex. Forty professionals and stakeholders attended and were invited to share their observations about the Prevent duty, any criticisms, and suggestions for improving the kind of work Prevent is supposed to do. The resulting policy briefing, entitled 'Trust and the Prevent Duty' is housed on the PaCCS website. A further, more detailed publication, is also forthcoming, co-authored with Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. We will be disseminating the findings to participants, stakeholders and policy makers. This work has inspired ourselves and other parties to research further into Prevent and the counter-terrorism strategy more generally. UEL and Middlesex also have plans for follow-up activities in future months.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FFEFEEB2-608B-4C93-98B9-908182AF21CC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54634ba9c7d807.76314964</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Muslims Trust and Cultural Dialogue has explored how the conditions for trusting intercultural relations can be nurtured. Its focus is on diverse spheres of activity - society and citizenship, culture and the arts, and business and finance - and it has identified different approaches that yield potential transferable paradigms for trust building.

We have explored the fraught history of trust in diverse societies, examining different historical and political traditions and visions of the good society. Our findings underline the importance of what might be called intercultural (rather than traditionally multicultural) approaches, in which integrationist discourse and the idea of entrenched cultural identities are challenged in an active dialogue between free partners who allow for their own perspectives to be tested and possibly modified. 

In particular, we have discovered that effective techniques for trust building - such as those used among the community arts organisations who have been the subject of our case studies - have a potential broader application. They involve shared goal setting and an awareness of mutual vulnerability, along with other stages in a process that builds trusting relations between individuals and groups for particular ends. We are currently finessing this as a prospective 'tool kit' to be road tested further in future funded projects.

Thus far, our findings can be summarised under the following headings:

1) New Knowledge
Through a series of events and talks we have begun to map the coordinates of trust as they appear on a 'macro' level - the level of politics and social and philosophy. This has taken place at events such as our two major international conferences where delegates were tasked with thinking about questions of trust in current debates about multiculturalism, and how to get 'beyond' Islamophobia. Among the participants were key figures in this area, such as Lord Bhikhu Parekh and Professors John L. Esposito and Tariq Modood, among a number of other international luminaries, and their papers are archived on our website (see 'Other Outputs'). We also welcomed Professor Onora O'Neill, one of the founding thinkers in the field of social trust in its modern form. The insights from these and other events are being collated for publication in two books which will make a major contribution to our understanding of intercultural trust and dialogue. 

In the third year we have focused on issues arising from Islamic innovations in business practice, with a conference at UEL on 'Trust and Islamic Capital', and one held by our partners at Michigan State on 'Global Halal', and how the politics of the permissible shapes Islamic cultural products and financial systems.

2) Networks and Collaborations
The project leader, Professor Morey, assembled a series of partnerships with colleagues from SOAS, University of London; Michigan State University; Virginia University; and York University (UK) as well as Professor Akbar S. Ahmed's 'Journey into Europe' research team, based at the American University, Washington DC.. Partners in these institutions have brought their particular disciplinary skills to bear on the different sections of the project, with results that can be seen on the website and with publications pending. 

In addition, we have partnered with non-HE organisations such as The British Library, The Dialogue Society and MEND (formerly Engage) to ensure in-put from practitioners. (One of the highlights of these interactions was finding out about the work of Equaliteach, whose business it is to confront prejudicial Islamophiobic attitudes in education and devise strategies for combating it.)

One of the most significant collaborations has been with Professor Akbar S Ahmed's Journey into Europe project. In its early days, Muslims, Trust and Dialogue was instrumental in working with Professor Ahmed to shape the project, which looks at Muslims, citizenship and identity at a pan-European level. We helped to draft the research questions and our own researchers worked on the British leg undertaking fieldwork surveys and interviews. Professor Ahmed is currently working on a book from this project, to be published towards the end of 2016. A feature-length documentary, entitled 'Journey into Europe' has already been completed and has been shown to appreciative audiences across the US and, more recently, in Britain.

I have included more on these relationships and the specific work undertaken by partners in the 'Collaboration' section elsewhere in this submission.

3) Research Methods
We have worked at different levels: the abstract/philosophical level where consideration of citizenship and 'the Good Society' are paramount; but also the practical level where we explore instances of intercultural trust building in everyday life. As a result we have used a mixture of methodologies to link the two: hermeneutic and discourse analysis traditions, communication studies paradigms and political theory, but also the anthropological and sociological staples of structured and semi-structured interviews with individuals and groups. This latter strand was initiated in the second year in collaboration with the Journey into Europe project (see above). In the third year this approach was extended in a series of small scale case studies where our researchers engaged with selected arts groups whose aims are to foster dialogue and intercultural understanding.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are building a resource for those, in a variety of sectors, involved in the promotion of intercultural trust and dialogue. This will consist of those publications currently in process - and which will appear over the next two or three years - and the website which already houses podcast and video material and to which more will be added this year, including practical tips and findings from the fieldwork. In addition, we have the two documentary films resulting from our collaborations with our American partners. All this material can be accessed by policy makers, those involved in the culture industries, and those working in the business and finance sector. These will be of interest to those thinking about how better to address Muslims with due consideration for their needs and values.

There are several areas for potential study that MTCD has thrown up. These include a further exploration of the concept of 'postsecularism', as a descriptive and critical category; and the notion of 'halal' as a broad marker of the culturally permissible. 

In particular, our own work has pointed out the potential value of 'interculturalism' as a comparatively new orientation - derived from education and constructivist paradigms - as an alternative to existing dominant binaries such as integration and assimilation. The importance of this more open, dialogic space, has also emerged from our case studies as the key to creating trust between different and potentially antagonistic groups.These areas provide a rich arena of study for future research projects.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>94FD318B-A95C-428D-94AE-3F5499FE3A8C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546339c307ab87.06652110</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
