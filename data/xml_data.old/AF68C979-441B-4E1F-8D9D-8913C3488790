We already know that people suffering from these diseases are more likely to experience symptoms of depression than those without them. We also know that people who experience depression symptoms are more likely to develop a physical illness later in life. However, as yet, we are not sure why depression symptoms and physical illnesses are related in these ways. 

I am particularly interested in the biological pathways linking depression symptoms and physical illnesses. These pathways include things like how our bodies respond to stress and how well our immune system works. For example, I am interested in a substance called cortisol which is released by the body when we feel stressed or sad. I am also interested in part of the immune system which is responsible for levels of inflammation. Research has shown that cortisol and inflammation do not work as well as they should in people who have depression symptoms or a physical illness. Therefore, I am interested in finding out whether changes in these things can explain the link between depression symptoms and physical illness morbidity in people who suffer from a variety of different physical illnesses. 

My research fits in well with the ESRC's priorities for this award: biosocial research and secondary analyses of longitudinal data. I am proposing to conduct biosocial research since I am planning to study the biology of a problem that society is facing. In addition, I intend to use longitudinal data that has already been collected, but has not yet been used to answer the questions I am interested in. I will use two main methods to analyse my data: quantitative analyses of existing data and qualitative analyses of a new study. I will use data from studies such as Whitehall II, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and Midlife in the United States study (MIDUS) among others. Using these datasets will allow me to partly answer my questions using statistical analyses. In addition, I will conduct a qualitative study in order to speak to individuals living with either a mental or physical illness about their experiences of depression symptoms. This will enable me to explore how people think, feel and cope with their illnesses and their mood. 

This research is important for a number of reasons. First of all, research has shown that people who have depression symptoms and a physical illness are likely to experience more symptoms of their physical illness than those without depression symptoms. In other words, they are more likely to feel sicker than those without depression symptoms. This links to the second important reason. If we understand why people with physical illness also get depression symptoms then we can improve our treatment of these individuals. At the moment, our current treatment options are not always very effective. So, not only do these people suffer more symptoms of their illness, their depression symptoms do not always go away with treatment. If we can improve treatment, then we can reduce suffering. Another reason that this research is important is the scale of the problem. Currently a lot of people with a physical illness also experience depression symptoms. Sadly, research has shown that a lot of these patients do not get identified by doctors as needing extra help. I plan to raise awareness of this issue during the course of my fellowship by ensuring I reach out to policymakers, health professionals and the public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

A wide range of beneficiaries are expected from this work. Specifically, it is anticipated that academics, policy makers, health professionals and the wider community are all likely to benefit from the output of the proposed programme of work. 

How will they benefit from this research?

1. Academics. The knowledge generated by this research is likely to have a significant impact on scientific understanding and theory surrounding the issue of depression symptoms in those individuals with a comorbid physical illness. The inclusive nature of the research to capture different methods of measuring psychological distress (depression symptoms, negative affect, etc.) and multiple physical illnesses (coronary heart disease, diabetes, cancer etc.) will allow me to look for common biological pathways across a wide range of diseases. Therefore, my research findings are likely to appeal to academics working across a variety of disciplines such as the medical sciences, psychology, public health and epidemiology, biology and social sciences.

2. Policymakers. There is growing interest among policymakers in issues surrounding wellbeing and life satisfaction. The national government has signalled its commitment to wellbeing through initiating and maintaining the work on personal wellbeing in the UK conducted by the Office for National Statistics (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_319478.pdf). Public Health England is encouraging novel methods of reducing depression and risk of chronic disease. One of the aims of my research is to examine the influence of psychological distress on the onset of physical illness. As such, my findings are likely to be of interest to policymakers, particularly with regards to the organisation of services. The proposed programme of work is likely to fuel ideas, knowledge and debate among policymakers. 

3. Health professionals. The UK's IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Treatment) programme recently listed depression symptoms in those with a physical illness as a priority group of individuals to target for treatment. Therefore, greater understanding of depression symptoms and physical illness, and the implications for patient care, is likely to be of interest to a wide range of health professionals, including GPs, psychologists, community health workers, and gerontologists. 

4. Wider community. Since I am particularly interested in subclinical levels of distress, my findings are not just restricted to those with clinically diagnosable depression. As such, my findings should resonate with those living with physical illness, and their friends and relatives. My qualitative work will ensure that my research remains grounded in the experiences, thoughts and feelings of 'real' people. By impacting policymakers and health professionals, I hope to ultimately help those living with physical and mental illnesses.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>276659</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Roehampton University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Depression and sleep research</gtr:description><gtr:id>99016858-C348-4B8C-8CCD-B6D8FED896D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>3 papers using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).

I have been specifically interested in using this data to answer 2 key questions set out in my research proposal. 

First, how do depression symptoms relate to a variety of physical illnesses, and are there similarities and differences in the specific types of depression symptoms experienced. Second, why do depression symptoms relate to different physical illnesses, and are there biological explanations for the association. 

The first question has been addressed in a series of 4 original papers (all currently under review), examining the association between depression and somatic (i.e. bodily) symptoms and risk of future illness in people who were healthy to begin with. I have specifically explored the overlap between depression and poor sleep symptoms to show that people with high levels of depression symptoms commonly experience disruption to their sleep, and when these two factors are considered together, poor sleep, but not high depression symptoms, predict the onset of future diseases such as heart disease, cancer and arthritis. In addition to this work, I have also examined the association between high levels of depression symptoms and the risk of developing multiple diseases 10 years later, showing there is indeed a positive association. 

With regards to the second research question, I have produced 1 research paper which is currently in preparation for submission to a journal. In this paper I examine the association between high levels of depression symptoms and a measure of inflammation in the blood, C-reactive protein. I show that having a combination of both these factors predicts increased risk of developing lung disease, heart diseases such as heart failure, and diabetes.
