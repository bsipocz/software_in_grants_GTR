At the same time, eminent researchers in the field have called for better scientific understanding of the wider effects of gesturing with infants. With the forthcoming study we will conduct a rigorous examination of these further effects. Measures of parenting characteristics that promote healthy development will determine whether parents using gestures fare better than controls and whether gesturing to infants produces a more 'contented' baby. Measures of mind-mindedness and parental interaction will assess the quality of the parent-infant relationship. This has implications for health care professionals working with families where there is a need to improve mother-infant interaction. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81602</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings have prompted discussion among parenting and healthcare groups about the advisability of using BabySigning with infants.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6606E6E2-038F-4568-B3B2-4334D57464AD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464807f7f9c83.61043366</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Every week thousands of parents in the UK are joining Baby Sign classes. The Baby Signs promise is that, by using gestural communication with infants as young as six months, babies will speak earlier, be more contented and even have greater intelligence. The aims of this research were to examine whether using gestures alters the mother's perception of her infant, whether the quality of interaction is enhanced and the parent-child relationship more positive. 



Communicating with gesture changes the way that mother and baby interact with one another. Our first study aimed to elucidate this process by measuring maternal mind-mindedness (a mothers' willingness to treat her infant as an individual with a mind).

Videotaped observations of mother-infant dyads (who had taken part in a yearlong longitudinal RCT study of encouraged gesture) were coded for mind-mindedness. Mothers who were trained to use gestures with their infant (n = 9) demonstrated heightened levels of mind-mindedness compared to mothers in a control group (n = 9) displaying, for example, more maternal responsiveness to changes in their infant's attention and encouraging more independent action by their infant. These findings suggest that mothers who gestured with an infant may have engaged in more joint attention and been more attuned to their infant's intentions. 



We went on to explore the benefits of these differences in social interaction and evaluated the claim that gesturing with babies reduces stress and frustration. We compared self-reported parental stress of mothers who attended baby sign classes (n = 89) and those who attended general activity classes with their baby (n = 89). Baby sign group mothers were significantly more stressed than non-baby sign group mothers. Both groups of mothers came from similar backgrounds and did not differ on demographic factors. The only difference was the types of groups that mothers attended. Baby sign groups teach infant gestures and advertise improvements for infant development and maternal confidence, whereas general activity classes are based around music and activities and advertise a more pro-social environment.



We do not infer causality from this study or suggest that baby sign elicits stress in parents. The maternal levels of stress were not related to how long mothers had been attending baby sign classes, i.e. increased attendance was not correlated with higher stress levels. However, the differences were surprising. We conclude that baby sign classes appeal to mothers with higher pre-existing stress levels, possibly because of the advertised claims (e.g. stress reduction, better relationship with your infant). Mothers who are experiencing anxiety in their role as parent may be more attracted to a class that claims to help with parenting; and more likely to choose baby sign. 



Taken together our findings suggest that using gesture may be more suitable for infants who are at risk of language delay or developmental difficulties. Mothers who lack confidence in their ability to interact with their infant may also gain benefit from gestures because they facilitate more responsiveness.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has had a wide societal impact by informing health professionals and parents about the advantages and disadvantages of gesturing with an infant. The findings have informed policy in local sure start centres to encourage communication between parent and infants. It has also led to a change in practise by directly informing the development of new techniques used by speech and language therapists at Hertfordshire County Council.



Many parents involved in the project have taken a great interest in the results and used them to guide choices involving their infant. The also team delivered an ESRC Festival of Social Science event held in St Albans in March 2010. This event allowed parents, education professional and health professionals to talk to the researchers, discuss the findings, debate the current techniques used with parent and infants, and to participate in mother and baby sessions to encourage communication. 



Overall the project has provided objective advice to parents and professionals that was not available before. Most of the information regarding signing was previously provided by commercial companies selling the product and was largely unfounded. One of the key contributions of this project was to provide an impartial view of the benefits, or otherwise, of signing.



Future uses of the work include a planned roll-out and evaluation of a gesture intervention aimed at enhancing the communication between low socio-economic status mothers and their preverbal infants. Dr Elizabeth Kirk is working with Hertfordshire NHS Speech and Language Therapy service to plan and deliver this project. 
 Two journal articles have arisen from the project so far:

The results from the project were also disseminated at three conferences:

Pine, K.J., &amp;amp; Kirk, E. (2008). A longitudinal study investigating the early use of gestures with infants. World Infant Mental Health Conference, Japan, August 2008.



The project has also led to active engagement in an international collaboration of gesture researchers from seven countries. This will be the first study to explore cultural differences in the motivations, experiences and expectations of parents who sign with their infants. The University of Hertfordshire team is the UK arm of this collaboration.



Finally, the results from the project have been featured on several websites, internet forums (e.g. the British Psychological Society's research digest), local and national newspapers (e.g. Observer on Sunday) and at the ESRC Festival of Science event.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>748B5E08-2EEF-47DB-8834-8C3F53345FA3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1208666908.749069b2f14ea8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23033858</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Collaboration with Local Services and new PhD project</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>418679DF-F034-4F1C-8A0D-521371184673</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The findings have informed policy in local sure start centres, with a series of sessions being run to encourage communication between parent and infants.
