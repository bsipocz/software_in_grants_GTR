While a significant body of research has been published in recent years on gay, lesbian and waria Indonesians (notably Boellstorff; Blackwood; Wieringa; Graham Davies; Oetomo), its focus has been principally anthropological, discussing how gay and lesbian lives are lived in Indonesia. In contrast, there is a dearth of research examining representations of gay and lesbian Indonesians in film, literature or the broader mass media. Nonetheless, Boellstorff has argued that the media, including cinema, has been 'crucial in the formation of gay and lesbian subject positions'. Therefore, this project will complement existing ethnographic findings by assessing how gay, lesbian and waria lives have been cinematically imagined by Indonesians (directors, writers, and actors), the vast majority of whom do not self-identify as gay or lesbian.\n\nResearch for this book draws on extensive research carried out at the Jakarta Film archive. It will present an analysis of a range of Indonesian films, ranging from recent Indonesian commercial successes such as Arisan! (The Gathering), Realita, cinta dan Rock n Roll (Reality, love and rock n roll) and Berbagi suami (Love for share) to films from the New Order period, some of which are almost forgotten, and also very difficult to access such as Akulah Vivian (I am Vivian), Remaja di lampu merah (Youth at the traffic lights) and Istana kecantikan (Palace of beauty). Archival research also allows for detailed contextualisation of the films by drawing on contemporary press reports, magazine articles and festival commentaries.\n\nThis research will bring to the fore ideas and debates relating to cultural contact, assimilation, representation and resistance. It will examine the influence of Western gay identities in Indonesian cinematic representations, and also point to specifically local manifestations of non-normative sexualities. Thus the research will also be situated within debates on globalisation and cultural transformation, specifically global queering.\n\nIn addition to detailed analysis of the films, the research will seek to show how Indonesian audiences, and particularly gay, lesbian and transgender audiences, might respond to these films. Rather than simply rely on the witnesses of the published voices of film critics and cultural commentators, this research also incorporates the results of focus group discussions which were conducted in Indonesia. The participants all identified as gay, lesbian, or waria, and the results provide useful evidence of 'resistant spectatorship'. In particular my research explores what strategies, are used by gay/lesbian/waria spectators when watching portrayals of gay/lesbian/waria characters in films which have been invariably perceived to be negative.\n\nFinally, this research makes an important contribution to Indonesian cinema studies on the following grounds:\n\nIt will be the first ever study to map out the development of gay, lesbian and waria representations in Indonesian cinema. \nIt will firmly contextualise more recent films into Indonesian cinema history as a whole, thus integrating the New Order Period and the post-1998 period within one thematic study.\nIt will make a significant contribution to understandings of the contemporary period of Indonesian cinema, in which issues of gender and sexuality have come to be so dominant. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate aim of this Research Fellowship is to produce a monograph on gay, lesbian and waria representations in Indonesian cinema. In addition to the clear academic beneficiaries, the findings from my research will be of benefit to a number of users, in terms of the contribution it will play, internationally and nationally, in developing knowledge about Indonesia's creative industries and cultural heritage. My research will bring together findings on a large volume of primary materials about Indonesian cinema, much of which is difficult to access and/or largely forgotten in Indonesia. Furthermore, my research will also be useful for many NGOs and activists in Indonesia in thinking about how marginalised groups are represented and understood in the mainstream media. Given the potential interest of this research to many beyond the academic research community, it is intended that a number of strategies be used to communicate with identified potential beneficiaries. A key aim will be the eventual dissemination of materials in Indonesian as well as English. This will included the translation of the monograph into Indonesian, and publication by a local Indonesian publisher.\n\nIdentified Potential Beneficiaries\n\nIndonesian public as at large\nIndonesian LGBTQ (Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) NGOs\nIndonesian NGOs working on gender and human rights\nIndonesians working in the film industry - production and promotion, including film festivals\nBritish policy makers / government agencies working on bilateral relations.\nIndonesian community in Britain. Indonesian Embassy.\nSOAS, University of London.\nBritish and International film festival circuit\n\n\nI have organised a monthly Indonesian film screening, in collaboration with the Indonesian Embassy in London, and I have raised issue from my research when introducing relevant films. The audience for this event comprises; UK based Indonesians, students and general public interested in Asian film. I fully anticipate the continuation of such events in the future.\n\nFurthermore I hope to present my research to British audiences such as the Anglo-Indonesia Society, The Royal Asiatic Society and Asia House, in order to develop awareness of key issues related to Indonesian cinema among those British constituencies with a specific interest in the languages and cultures of Indonesia and South East Asia.\n\nIn Indonesia I have spoken at a workshop on sexuality and the media aimed at forging links between LGBTQ activists and academia. I have also run specific discussions for activists and the wider public in cooperation with Indonesian LGBTQ (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer) NGOs. Such cooperation will also continue and indeed be enhanced by the publication of the book.\n\nI have written short articles relating to my research in the online magazine Inside Indonesia (principally academic audience, but also attracting wider third sector, NGO, general public audience) and in the Jakarta Post. Networks have already been established with personnel at the Indonesian NGOs Gaya Nusantara, Pelangi Perempuan and Arus Pelangi. I have also made connections with key personnel behind the Indonesian Queer film Festivals, and with journalists writing on cinema in Indonesian newspapers and magazines. With the support of these contacts I aim to publish shorter reviews and summaries of my research (in Indonesian and English) in the national media, NGO newletters, and on cultural/film websites. I also hope to be able to participate in discussion events at Indonesian Film Festivals.\n\nMy research has attracted increasing attention from overseas, principally Indonesia itself. It is to be hoped that this will transform into research students from Indonesia coming to study under my supervision at SOAS, which will of course have short term financial benefit for the UK, but also help to foster</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>43355</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Genders and Sexualities in Indonesian Cinema: constructing gay, lesbi and waria identities on screen</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A2D726E-A9AC-4258-B1A8-9C67C96D67B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A lecture given at the Royal Asiatic Society discussing the key points raised in my book of the same title.

The book was published by Routledge in 2013, and so far has received two very positive reviews in academic journals.
 My research analysed a range of Indonesian films depicting non-normative sexualities and genders made between the early 1970s and around 2008. While there has been a tendency by film scholars to focus only on the period following the ending of the Suharto dictatorship, this research specifically sought to provide a broader perspective by looking at both the new Order (1966-98) and the subsequent democratic period (1998-). Thus this research made a significant contribution to the field by presenting a strong historical overview of representations of non-normative genders and sexualities in Indonesian film. In addition to discussing a number of long-forgotten films, the research also points to a number of continuities between cinematic representation from the New Order period and those of the post-New Order period. This is an important point that counters prevailing arguments among film and literature scholars who have focused on an apparent break in Indonesian cultural production that came with the fall of the Suharto regime.
 While New Order films depicting gay, lesbi and waria characters are often today written off by critics and filmmakers as being depressing, negative and prejudiced, my archival research show that contemporary reception of those films was often far more nuanced. I have unearthed significant documentation showing that some of the films from the New Order period were seen as inspirational, that they generated debates, and that there was often a willingness from film makers and film goers to change popular thinking about non-normative sexualities in Indonesian society. These findings were compounded by my focus group research with gay, lesbi and waria Indonesian who often found the films from this earlier period to be more meaningful to their lives than more recent film with their tendency towards a more elite setting.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am still trying to get this book published in the Indonesian Language.
