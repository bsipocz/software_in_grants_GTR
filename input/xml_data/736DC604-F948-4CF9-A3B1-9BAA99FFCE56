Many life processes occurring within cells, such as energy generation or production of new building blocks, need to be spatially organized, because different processes require different environments or components. Cells achieve this by also using membranes to maintain specialized internal compartments. Furthermore, compartments need to communicate and exchange material with each other. Because membranes are very versatile, they can also fulfil these tasks: For example, by physically touching each other, or by exchanging small transport carriers. The composition and shape of membranes are often really sophisticated, and depend on their particular function, but in many cases, we still do not know how specific architecture is achieved and why it is needed. Our research aims at understanding specialized membrane architectures, and how they perform their particular tasks. We combine different microscopy methods that allow us to at the same time visualize a particular membrane?s composition and its shape in 3D. 
Specialized architectures of cellular membranes are vital for many of our body?s functions, including the uptake and processing of nutrients. Impaired membrane architecture plays roles in diseases, such as in Alzheimer?s, a frequent form of dementia. Moreover, when viruses infect the body, they hijack many of the cell?s membranous compartments and use them to multiply.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cellular membranes act as dynamic boundaries that delimit compartments and at the same time host an enormous range of vital, membrane-dependent functions. Through local association with protein complexes, membranes are involved in numerous metabolic processes, control the exchange of water, nutrients and signals, perform intracellular trafficking and communication tasks, facilitate biogenesis of cellular components, and provide structural integrity to organelles and cells. Many membrane-bound processes require a fine interplay between protein function and local changes in membrane shape, curvature and topology. While a lot is known about protein function and dynamics associated with these processes, linking these data to changes of the underlying membrane shape is challenging. Therefore, the role of membrane architecture in many cellular processes has remained elusive. Our goal is to understand the interplay of compositional and structural aspects of functional membrane architectures.
We have developed a correlative light and electron microscopy procedure that allows precisely locating fluorescent signals in electron tomograms. This method allows us to directly link presence or absence of protein of interest to membrane shape. It also enables acquisition of large, multi-dimensional datasets that can be subjected to quantitative analysis. We also expand this experimental concept by combining it with electron cryo tomography, which allows us to visualize assemblies of protein structures at cellular membranes.
Our projects address questions linking membrane dynamics with compartmentalization. Contact sites between organelles are paradigms for functional domains within cellular membranes that compartmentalise many physiological processes including lipid metabolism and signalling. We aim at understanding the interdependence of architecture and function at organelle contacts sites. We also study the mechanisms of mitochondrial fission and removal of mitochondria through mitophagy in mammalian cells. These processes are part of the cell?s quality control for maintaining a pool of healthy mitochondria. Along the same lines, we aim at understanding the changes of mitochondrial membrane structure that play a pivotal role during programmed cell death, when mitochondrial proteins are released into the cytoplasm to act as key apoptotic factors. Finally, we are interested in the early endosomal network. The endocytic pathway serves to sort, recycle and degrade material internalized from the cell surface. We wish to understand how membrane fusion and fission events direct the flow of membrane and cargo in yeast cells.
We currently use budding yeast and mammalian cell cultures as model systems. In the long term, we are planning to extend our approach to multi-cellular organisms, to eventually address the roles of membrane ultrastructure in tissue physiology and development.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>437358</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FameLab 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1CDAB18E-E18F-4AE3-9575-A5E2713E24E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PhD Student Nicholas Ader from my lab took part in the FameLab Science Communication Competition Cambridge.
