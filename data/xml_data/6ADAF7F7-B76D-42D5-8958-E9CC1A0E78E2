[source: Gartner 2010] However this market is in its infancy, and organisations trying to
support a mobile workforce face numerous problems such as how to support the wide
diversity of mobile devices, dealing with intermittent and unreliable wireless reception, and
communicating with devices that are frequently powered down or asleep.
TJJ Ltd has developed an innovative software platform known as Mercury that is unique in
solving all these issues, and which we therefore believe has very wide applicability in
connecting organisations with their mobile staff.
Mercury will be of great value to any business or organisation that has a mobile workforce,
whether their own staff, or subcontractors or franchisees; for example, maintenance workers,
delivery services or healthcare professionals. It provides a highly secure and reliable way of
communicating between the enterprise?s regular applications and the mobile devices carried
by its workforce. It also makes it much easier to deploy and manage mobile apps, regardless
of the type of smartphone they are using. Important information gets through faster (even
from ?sleeping? devices), and business processes can be managed more effectively.
Businesses will see a rapid payback from investing in Mercury.
Delivered as a 'cloud' service, Mercury is highly scalable, meaning that it can be readily rolled
out into international markets from a UK base. The global market is worth perhaps $1bn or
more, so Mercury has the potential to become a large business, employing perhaps 100+
people within a few years.
A fully working version of the software has already been developed, and is being field tested.
This project will undertake market research - to validate and quantify the market opportunity;
some market testing ? to test the acceptability of the product; and finally produce a business
plan that sets out the ?go to market? strategy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">700086</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
