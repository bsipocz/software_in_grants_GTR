Around 1 billion people, predominantly in the developing world, harbour parasitic nematodes that cause chronic and debilitating diseases. In addition, nematodes cause a significant economic burden to agriculture, affecting crops and livestock throughout the world.

All nematodes share a common lifecycle growing from an egg through 4 immature larval stages before reaching the sexually mature adult stage.

Trichostrongylid infections of livestock are widespread causing morbidity, death and economic losses. Effective antihelminthic drugs are limited and multiple resistance is emerging thus highlighting the need to identify novel targets and new means of nematode control. All nematodes undergo a set developmental pathway from the egg through 4 larval stages before reaching the sexually mature adult stage. Progression from embryo to larvae involves a hatching process, and from individual larval stages to adulthood involves a repeated process termed moulting, where the collagenous cuticle is shed and a new one synthesised. The astacin class of enzymes are key players in the nematode-specific processes of hatching, exoskeleton synthesis and moulting. The specific roles played by the nematode-specific subclass V astacins have been confirmed in the Caenorhabditis elegans model experimental system and will now be examined in the veterinary parasite Haemonchus contortus. This project will identify and functionally characterize the H. contortus class V astacins. Information gained in this system will be of relevance in other nematode parasites of animals and plants, and will be aimed at characterizing and exploiting these enzymes with the overall goal of identifying vaccine and drug targets to treat and control nematode infections.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>227044</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>358690</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC Project Grant panel A responsive mode</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>bb/I011218/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>A0607043-0568-4868-B09A-C27E52FC054C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546cb612b8aec4.19022351</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>22000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>VIP award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2009-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Wellcome Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B1807E2D-D5E3-4063-A6BC-2F2BA2BD559F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>B4BB2F129790</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have been taken forward in a follow on application to identify compounds that may be developed as nove anthelmintics.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C0A10FC2-E39C-45E7-A8B8-32CDB8EB6AAA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>546cb09fb91e76.60772614</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Parasitic nematodes are a major pest of plants and animals. Around 1 billion people, predominantly in the developing world, harbour parasitic nematodes that cause chronic and debilitating diseases. In addition, nematodes cause a significant economic burden to agriculture, affecting crops and livestock throughout the world. Methods to control nematodes are relatively limited, and drug resistance is becoming common. All nematodes share a common lifecycle growing from an egg through 4 immature larval stages before reaching the sexually mature adult stage. Progression from egg to larvae involves a hatching process, and from individual larval stages to adulthood involves a repeated process termed moulting, where the external skeleton is shed and a new one synthesised. The moulting process allows growth and development.
The astacin enzymes are catalysts that are involved in the processes of hatching, exoskeleton synthesis and moulting. The specific roles played by this class of enzymes were originally established in a model experimental system (Caenorhabditis elegans) and have now been validated in an important veterinary parasite. The nematode Haemonchus contortus is a common and economically significant gastrointestinal parasite of sheep and goats. The results generated in the H. contortus and C. elegans systems are also relevant to other parasites of animals and plants, and this has now been established for the human infective filarial nematode Brugia malayi. The project aims were to identify, study and exploit these enzymes with the overall goal of identifying vaccine and drug targets to treat and control nematode infections.
In this study we have successfully identified and characterized the key enzymes that are involved in the synthesis and remodelling of the exoskeleton of both Haemonchus contortus and Brugia malayi. We have proven that they play nematode-specific roles, key criteria for the development of a potential drug or vaccine. In addition, we have developed a range of experimental tools that will be invaluable in future targeted drug development; these include a nematode transgenic complementation system, a recombinant protein expression system and specific protease and collagenase assays.
In this project we have successfully developed a nematode complementation system, whereby existing C. elegans cuticle and moulting mutants can be rescued via transgenesis with parasitic nematode genes. This has been done for Haemonchus contortus genes, and for the first time with Brugia malayi genes. This had led to the development of numerous transgenic C. elegans lines that express H. contortus and B. malayi astacins, peroxidase and protease inhibitor genes. This resource will be invaluable in future targeted drug development studies.

We have also developed a novel autoinduction protocol for the expression of H. contortus and B. malayi recombinant proteins in a functionally active form. This information will be of interest to other groups working in this field.

We have also developed a nematode cuticle collagen-processing assay that will be used to screen for collagen processing enzymes and their inhibitors. Again, this will be a useful resource for future targeted drug development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In this project we have successfully developed a nematode complementation system, whereby existing C. elegans cuticle and moulting mutants can be rescued via transgenesis with parasitic nematode genes.
