Fergusson is a signifcant and intriguing early-American author. During the colonial and revolutionary periods, she wrote lyric poetry that was famous all over the mid-Atlantic region, yet her writing circulated almost entirely in manuscript. Because her work was never published, and perhaps also because of her ambivalent political affiliations, Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson has remained relatively unknown, and her work unappreciated, for over 200 years. The 'Willing Commonplace Book' (of which only one copy exists) is perhaps the most important of Fergusson's extant manuscripts. Through selections from her own poetry, and the work of other famous British and American authors, Fergusson produced in her commonplace book a transatlantic literary collection in which the writing of women was central. But as well as creating a new Anglo-American canon, Fergusson also used her book to encode a complex political message. Within the pages of a book which puports to celebrate the cultural achievements of the new United States, there are moments of national(ist) betrayal (which reflect Fergusson's own experiences of dispossession and abandonment during the Revolutionary War). The book is important, 1) because it offers a window on an undiscovered world of eighteenth-century women readers and writers 2) for the disaffected politics that Elizabeth Fergusson wrote into its heart and 3) for it's unique status as a commemorative textual object. My critical edition will illuminate the world of eighteenth-century manuscript circulation and creation for the modern reader, as well as unlocking the intriguing autobiographical puzzles of the book's content and design. I completed background work toward producing the edition in 2006, and will spend a period of HEI supported leave from January 2008 identifying and annotating Fergusson's literary extracts. I would use the period of AHRC funded leave to complete work on the edition's scholarly apparatus and to write a substantial critical introduction to Fergusson and her writing. A period of AHRC leave will allow me to complete and publish this critical edition of a distinctive, important, and presently entirely unknown, eighteenth-century work. \n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25497</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F00365X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
