fever</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/H008950/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposal aims to further develop and refine our recent breakthrough of an immunisation strategy for the control of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) by increasing the magnitude and duration of immunity through improved adjuvancy (compounds given along with virus antigens that help direct the type of immune response to an infectious agent and improve its magnitude and duration - all important for a good vaccine) and testing the potential vaccine in field trials in Tanzania where MCF is a problem. Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a fatal disease of cattle, deer, bison and pigs, caused by a group of viruses (herpesviruses) including ovine herpesvirus-2 and alcelaphine herpesvirus-1. These viruses infect their natural hosts efficiently (sheep for OvHV-2 and wildebeest for AlHV-1), causing no apparent disease, but in the disease-susceptible animals, MCF is usually fatal and consequently has a profound affect on animal welfare and production. The virus is transmitted by aerosol or by contact and most lambs or wildebeest calves are infected shortly after birth and are capable of then infecting susceptible cattle. There is no vaccine currently available for MCF, but we have recently developed a potential vaccine that works well in experimental studies. The effect of AlHV-1 MCF on pastoralist communities in sub-Saharan Africa is profound, with social, economic and welfare impact. In two studies of MCF in Tanzania and Kenya, incidence in studied areas was found to be 6% and 10% respectively. The high rate of cattle death meant that MCF was rated as the most important disease risk in areas with wildebeest contact. Field trials in Tanzania are essential to determine the efficacy of the alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AlHV-1) MCF vaccine and will inform further refinement of the vaccine as necessary. It is important to determine the contribution of the different components of an immune response that will protect affected cattle. Although there is a strong correlation between virus-neutralising antibody and protection, we need to determine whether cell-mediated immunity (CMI) including cytotoxic T cell activity (CTL) is involved or not in protection. Furthermore, we need to identify virus component antigens that stimulate protective immune responses in cattle. This will allow vaccine development for ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2, a highly genetically-related virus to AlHV-1) MCF, which is a problem not only in Africa but worldwide where natural carrier animals and disease-susceptible animals mix. This dual approach is important as there is more likely to be a commercial uptake of an AlHV-1 and OvHV-2 MCF vaccine than either one singly. This study will use defined new generation adjuvant compounds to improve the current AlHV-1 MCF vaccine and test this in field trials in Tanzania. For very little extra effort, we can identify the protective virus component antigens of AlHV-1 and use the equivalent OvHV-2 ones to attempt a vaccine to OvHV-2 MCF. This increases the chances of commercial uptake of an MCF vaccine. The expected principal outcome of this work wil be implementation of a vaccine disease control strategy to have an impact on animal mortality due to MCF and improvement of quality of life of pastoralists and farmers within 5 years of the conclusion of this project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal aims to further develop and refine our recent breakthrough of an immunisation strategy for the control of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) by increasing the magnitude and duration of immunity through improved adjuvancy and testing the potential vaccine in field trials in Tanzania where MCF is a problem. MCF is a major contributor to cattle mortality in Eastern and Southern Africa wherever wildebeest are found (natural disease-free carriers of the alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 MCF virus). This in turn adversely affects the income and quality of life of pastoralists and poor farmers. There is no vaccine currently available for MCF. However we have recently developed a potential vaccine for AlHV-1 MCF that stimulates a mucosal barrier of virus-neutralising antibody. We aim to improve this vaccine by the strategic use of toll-like receptor (TLR)agonists as adjuvants to stimulate the appropriate protective immunity in cattle and test the improved vaccine in field trials in Tanzania. TLR agonists are proving very useful as adjuvants to direct the quality and magnitude of immune responses for improved vaccine design. We know that high virus neutralising antibody titres correlate with protection, but the role of cell-mediated immunity will be studied for its contribution (if any). Furthermore, for minimum effort and added value, protective antigens of AlHV-1 will be identified to clone the equivalent antigen genes from ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2) into an attenuated AlHV-1 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) that we have developed as a viral vector. AlHV-1 and OvHV-2 are genetically very similar. We predict that the outcomes will include: An improved immunisation strategy leading to a vaccine for AlHV-1 MCF; Proof of concept for an OvHV-2 MCF vaccine based on OvHV-2 antigens in an AlHV-1 BAC; Field trial confirmation of the efficacy of an AlHV-1 MCF vaccine. This will have an impact on pastoralist quality of life within 5 years of project completion.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Field trials with the existing potential AlHV-1 vaccine will determine its efficacy and could give a quick result in respect of MCF control (within 2 years) that would benefit the pastoralists, the consortium and be a public relations coup for the initiative. The Maasai and others have long wanted to see an effort in reducing the negative impact of MCF on their cattle and consequently their livelihoods. We predict that the vaccine will need to be improved (see objectives) and that implementation of an improved vaccine would give a measurable reduction of MCF in target areas within 2-5 years of the completion of this study. The development of an OvHV-2 vaccine strategy is envisaged within 5-6 years and an impact of this (as a consequence of future-funded work) in 6-8 years. We will know within 3-5 years of the completion of this project the degree of welfare and economic improvement of pastoralist cattle and the knock-on effect of improved wealth for the communities. The impact of the study goes beyond its immediate goal to implement a vaccine for MCF. By targeting MCF, the pastoralists will avoid upland areas where they currently take their cattle to avoid the disease. By doing this they will minimise exposure of their cattle to trypanosomosis and East Coast Fever, two serious diseases that also affect cattle production and pastoralist livelihoods. In fact the local Tanzanian scientific community position on this is that there is no doubt that control of MCF would result in an increase in survival of adult animals, with a direct improvement in herd productivity. It is also likely that, by permitting wet-season grazing on the short-grass plains, a vaccine against MCF would also reduce mortality and morbidity from tick-borne diseases and directly-transmitted diseases, as well as enhance survival and fertility through access to high-quality grazing at a critical time of year. Adverse environmental impacts associated with concentration of people and cattle in the highlands, which include overgrazing, erosion and tree-felling, might also be mitigated. One concern expressed by conservationists has been that the reduction in MCF-related mortality may lead to a rise in cattle numbers, which might further increase land-use pressure. Despite the importance of cattle as a measure of status and wealth in pastoralist society, current trends suggest that Maasai are now more likely to sell 'excess' animals that are produced or survive as a result of MCF control. For most herds, the growing demand for cash income to pay for grain, medicines, and school fees is likely to necessitate sustained commercial offtake. There is also a growing realisation of the need to improve the quality of livestock, not merely the quantity. Thus, although cattle numbers may increase slightly, a cattle population explosion is unlikely to occur in pastoralist communities, even if MCF is controlled. Another important impact of this work is that the development of a mucosal immune barrier to prevent MCF may translate to the vaccine control of other herpesvirus infections in other species, including humans. There is currently no herpesvirus vaccine that prevents infection and the establishment of latency. The strategy within this application will address this and the outcome should be of value to a much wider community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>329388</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Kenya, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>ILRI MCF Vaccine trials</gtr:description><gtr:id>A3F31FAD-CB11-45EC-B7F1-0E35B5100ED7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none as yet, vaccine trial under way January 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddab210e6fd3.16294257-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners provided support via contacts with ILRI, intellectual support,(e.g. advice on vaccine trial design), notes on experience in the MCF field trials that took place under the CIDLID grant in Tanzania.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provided vaccine virus and diagnostic reagents free-of-charge under a material transfer agreement.

The discussions centred on practical aspects of conducting a vaccine trial, particularly with respect to timing and our desire to establish a natural challenge by herding cattle with wildebeest.

The workshop was held to engage local community leaders and other stakeholder groups in the planned vaccine trial - with press reports arising from the meeting. A vaccine for MCF has been a talking point among Massai pastoralists for some years, so the prospect of a vaccine trial was viewed with some excitement and considerable support. The impact of the workshop were that an improved plan of the vaccine trial was produced and that it stimulated community involvement, including hiring local herders and much interest in the outcomes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a4e6d6db773.67783900</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Comparative DNA sequence-based analysis of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) virus (AlHV-1) in wildebeest and cattle in Tanzania and the virus strain (C500) used for vaccine development were carried out. The results indicate that the AlHV-1 virus circulating in East Africa has not diverged from the strain used for vaccine development. This finding is extremely important as it confirms that the C500 strain is an appropriate model for vaccine development. Furthermore, similarity with the wild-type virus reduces any risk of a novel virus mutant (different from the wild-type virus) escaping into the wild. This makes C500 strain safe for vaccination. We carried out the first partial quantitative analysis of the impact that MCF has on pastoralist livelihoods and the results provide an economic baseline against which vaccination strategies, and their impact, can be compared. The field trial of the vaccine indicated that the vaccine reduced infection with AlHV-1 by 57.7%. These findings will be used to refine and improve vaccine development efforts. 
The integrated management of rangelands around protected area ecosystems is currently one of the major priorities for the Ministries of Livestock and Fisheries Development and Natural Resources and Tourism, both to support the livelihoods and food security of pastoralists in these critical regions, and also to ensure the integrity of globally-important ecosystems, including World Heritage Sites. The results will provide a major contribution to discussions at initiatives of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development and Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism in Tanzania during forthcoming meetings in 2015 on the 'Tanzania Livestock Modernization Initiative' (which will be attended by the President of Tanzania and Ministers from Livestock and Natural Resources, as well as community leaders and NGOs) and 'Livestock-Wildlife management in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4B7951B9-4648-4380-B7A2-A8FADBDF3004</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545a49f2a5a4d9.72081132</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project was an international collaboration between University of Nottingham, University of Glasgow and Moredun Research Institute in the UK, and Sokoine Agricultural University, Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute and stakeholder groups in Tanzania. The aim of the project was to develop a vaccine for Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF), a fatal viral infection of cattle carried by wildebeest that threatens the livelihoods of livestock-keepers in Africa. The disease also has important consequences for land-use and conservation management in east Africa. 
A vaccine field trial was carried out in two successive years in northern Tanzania, using an immunization regime that had shown safety and efficacy in protecting cattle against experimental infection in the UK. The trial in Tanzania involved testing cattle against natural infection transmitted through contact with wildebeest. The work involved close engagement with local stakeholder and community groups, who rank MCF as one of the most important livestock diseases, and expressed substantial support and interest in the project. In both years, the trial herd was 100 cattle, of which 50 were vaccinated and 50 unvaccinated. After immunisation, the herd was grazed close to wildebeest during the calving season, when high levels of MCF virus shedding are expected. The cattle were sampled regularly to monitor immune responses to vaccination and were closely monitored to assess wildebeest exposure, the safety of the vaccine and to detect the onset of MCF. No adverse effects were associated with vaccination, and high antibody levels were detected, consistent with findings in UK cattle. Only two unvaccinated animals succumbed to fatal MCF during each trial, which was much lower than expected from the published literature and previous studies, and as a result the study could not demonstrate protection against fatal MCF induced by natural challenge. However, multiple cases of non-fatal MCF were detected - previously thought to be very rare - and PCR analysis has demonstrated that MCF virus infection was significantly less likely in vaccinated animals. In addition to generating data on vaccine performance, the study has therefore also raised questions about the transmission and progression of MCF in natural infections. To address some of these questions, additional work was carried out in Tanzania which demonstrated: (a) that a high proportion of wildebeest have evidence of MCF virus infection; and (b) that the virus used in the immunization trial was similar to local Tanzanian strains. 
Studies on the social, economic and environmental impacts of MCF showed that, in the absence of a MCF vaccine, 90% of pastoral households in MCF-risk areas are forced to move cattle away from the main residence to avoid wildebeest. This has negative impacts on livestock production, and reduces by 64% the availability of milk for families. 
Studies in the UK were carried out to enhance the duration and strength of immunity to the vaccine; to develop assays to measure cellular immunity; and to identify a viral protein that will be a useful diagnostic tool for both wildebeest-associated MCF and sheep-associated MCF.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>During stakeholder meetings in Tanzania, further field trials of the vaccine have been highlighted as a priority in order to explore how implementation of a partially-protective MCF vaccination strategy has value in developing integrated land-use management strategies around wildlife protected areas, both to support the livelihoods and food security of pastoralists in these critical regions, and also to ensure the integrity of globally-important ecosystems. The findings of this project have been taken forward in discussions with GALVmed, to explore further opportunities for vaccine development and field trials.

This non-invasive route of infection mimics the natural route and provides a small animal model for the testing of recombinant vaccine candidates where limited amounts of vaccine antigen or containment requirements make the use of cattle impractical or uneconomic.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5DB03D2D-A928-4380-BCE4-0BB3E0969FA9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development of a laboratory animal model for MCF challenge allows the testing of vaccine candidates where they are difficult to produce in bulk (recombinant proteins) or require a level of biological containment that may not be available for livestock species.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3933462383.1635923c6b5e01a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>An intranasal model for infection of rabbits with Alcelaphine herpesvirus-1</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The capsid of the MCF virus Alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 is comprised of multiple copies of the gene products of open reading frames (ORFs) 17.5, 25, 26, 62 and 65.
