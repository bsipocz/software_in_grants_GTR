We are developing educational materials designed to supplement existing secondary school alcohol education by teaching students skills to better manage temptation and/or pressure to drink excessively and to be resilient in a ?binge drinking? culture. Our and others? research indicates that excessive alcohol consumption could be reduced by teaching young people strategies and skills to resist pressures to drink excessively. In our recent research, we used surveys, individual interviews and focus groups to help us develop video resources to teach young people such skills. The videos and related lesson plans were then evaluated by teachers, pupils, and alcohol service workers. All three groups felt that the videos could fill a gap in existing alcohol education. However, it was clear that the materials should be further improved before they are formally tested. Thus, in the proposed programme of work, the team that designed and made the original videos will be joined by a school-based resilience expert. We will revise the videos and finalise the lesson plans. We will then conduct a small-scale study in 4 schools and collect feedback from teachers and students to determine the feasibility of a larger scale study to measure the impact of our video-based lessons.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We are developing educational materials designed to teach 16-18 year olds skills to manage temptation and/or pressure to drink excessively. The theorised mechanism of action is that developing Drink Refusal Self-Efficacy and enhancing personal resilience will better enable young people to make healthy choices about alcohol use. Our recent research employed mixed methods to develop and evaluate video resources to teach young people strategies and skills to resist alcohol. Evaluation of these materials by teachers, pupils, and alcohol service workers provided ?proof of concept?, and indicated that they would make a novel contribution to school-based alcohol education. However, it was evident that aspects should be revised before assessing their impact in an intervention evaluation study. There is currently a lack of evidence as to the potential impact of video resources for alcohol education. The proposed research will involve revising the videos, finalising lesson plans, and conducting a feasibility study. It will address several aspects outlined in the call for proposals: estimating recruitment and retention rates and influences; testing acceptability and compliance; developing procedures and protocols; and identifying intervention comparators. It will also continue our use of novel approaches to intervention development.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>142773</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>12EC5CA9-046F-429F-8ED5-C1EB1A2390FD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Using qualitative methods within a mixed-methods approach to developing and evaluating interventions to address harmful alcohol use among young people.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1245093f3e25606465c4cd2b2c347252"><gtr:id>1245093f3e25606465c4cd2b2c347252</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>de Visser RO</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0278-6133</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56408d6fd90c39.97779325</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AD09B6F0-AC0F-4926-889C-5A03C4B78263</gtr:id><gtr:title>Staying in the 'sweet spot': A resilience-based analysis of the lived experience of low-risk drinking and abstention among British youth.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychology &amp; health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae71b442c721536aa86cb8925bdd6bd9"><gtr:id>ae71b442c721536aa86cb8925bdd6bd9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Graber R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0887-0446</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56cc6c7c2f4066.10758983</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_13079</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>5841ECCD-C9B1-4B8B-993F-ACC8E9585125</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.1  Primary preventions interventions to modify behaviours or promote well-being</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
