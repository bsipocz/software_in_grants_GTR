The medical director there wanted purer vitamin and mineral supplements to support people who came to the Centre, with less excipients and fillers, and with a higher grade of materials.

Nature's Own was created to meet this need and our reputation has grown ever since with the simple philosophy of offering the best possible solutions to nutritional needs.

&amp;quot;Best&amp;quot; for us means products that work as nature does. Although chemical vitamins and minerals act as a stimulus for change in the body (and we do sell these too) we believe that the true role of nutrition is to support the body in its own processes of healing and well being.

This means not so much stimulating the body, but nurturing and nourishing it. We express this in our philosophy by saying our aim is to help people to help themselves. By this we mean we want to help their bodies by providing them with the most holistic and appropriate forms of nutrition for enabling the body to help itself.

We have achieved this goal with our Food State supplements, which are used by Practitioners and Doctors all over the world. We especially appeal to those Practitioners and Doctors who see that the role of the food we eat is to supply broad spectrum nutrition to the body. In other words, these practitioners understand that the most important role of our food is to supply a full range of food-minerals and food-vitamins to our bodies. This is exactly what we provide in our Nature's Own Food State supplements.

The reason this role of nourishing the body is so important is that, due to lifestyle and modern farming techniques, we are lucky to get half the nutrition our parents and grandparents did in the 50's and 60's.

Now that we are in the 21 st Century and our third decade as a company, our strategy is very clear for us.

We want to help customers like you, Practitioners, Doctors and aware Health Food retailers and their customers to understand the extraordinary role played by broad spectrum nutrition in filling the food nutrient gap which prevails for almost everyone.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">751494</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
