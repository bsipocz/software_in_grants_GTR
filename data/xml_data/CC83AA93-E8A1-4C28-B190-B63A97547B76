These symptoms are characterised by obvious epistemic faults. Delusions may be absurd in content and resistant to counterevidence, and autobiographical memories may be wildly inaccurate. I am interested in whether these 'imperfect cognitions' have also epistemic benefits, that is, whether they contribute to the preservation or acquisition of knowledge in the context in which they occur. For instance, one may argue that having a distorted memory of an important autobiographical event for someone with serious memory deficits is better than having no memory at all of that event. Being able to remember something about one's past helps one maintain a sense of self which is instrumental to autonomous thought and action and effective communication with others. In the proposed project my primary aim is to explore a new way of looking at delusional beliefs, distorted memories, and even 'imperfect cognitions' occurring in the non-clinical population, and develop the notion of 'epistemic innocence'. This is the idea that even a false belief, say, may be conducive to knowledge in some circumstances and have epistemic benefits that outweigh its epistemic faults. This notion may change the way we think about epistemic evaluation. Attempting to establish whether a cognition is true or rational is not a simple affair and makes sense when embedded in a context. The same false belief about the past may be epistemically innocent when had by someone with dementia whose memories are fading, and wholly epistemically objectionable when had by someone who has the capacity to reconstruct the memory of the same event more reliably. The development of the notion of epistemic innocence will impact on the philosophy of mind, and in particular on the overlap and differences between 'imperfect cognitions', and on cognitive psychology which is interested in whether the formation process of delusions and distorted memories is continuous with the formation process of non-pathological beliefs and memories. Ultimately, if it can be shown that at least some delusions and distorted memories are epistemically innocent, this will have implications for clinical psychiatry and in particular the management of symptoms of people with dementia and schizophrenia. If a false belief, say, is conducive to knowledge, we may have good reasons not to challenge it.
The main research output will be a monograph on epistemic innocence based on three research papers to be prepared during the 12-month Fellowship. In order to obtain feedback on my analysis of the epistemic benefits of imperfect cognitions and to draw the attention of the academic community to the notion of epistemic innocence, I shall host an interdisciplinary two-day workshop in Birmingham half-way through the Fellowship. Papers presented at the workshop will be gathered in an edited collection, and the speakers will be invited to join an interdisciplinary research network on the themes of the project, aimed at promoting further collaborative work. In addition to leading experts in epistemology, philosophy of mind, psychology and psychiatry, I want to engage service users, carers and clinical psychiatrists in the project. They will participate in the workshop, but I also envisage two focus groups to be held after the end of the Fellowship and funded by the University, to encourage a discussion of the possible implications of the project results for clinical practice. Other means of dissemination and knowledge exchange will be a project webpage on the existing University website and a Twitter feed. A post-doctoral research assistant will be hired part-time for 12 months (30%) to help organise the workshop, co-edit the collection of papers with me, and maintain the project webpage and Twitter feed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Fellowship proposes to apply the newly developed notion of epistemic innocence to delusional beliefs and distorted memories occurring in schizophrenia and dementia. Reports that are regarded as the signpost of madness can be shown to have an important role in people's understanding of the world when their capacity to make plausible hypotheses and access to autobiographical memory are seriously compromised. The nature of this project lends itself to interdisciplinary and collaborative work as implications of the research will have to be assessed with respect to theories in epistemology, philosophy of mind, cognitive science and psychiatry. Some indication of how the research outcomes may impact on these fields have been provided in the academic beneficiaries section. Here I would like to focus on the impact that the research might have outside academic circles and in particular on service users, their carers, clinical psychiatrists and other mental healthcare professionals, and finally the general public. 
If we realise that some of the most distressing symptoms of schizophrenia and dementia have some benefits for the people affected by these disorders, the repercussions may be quite significant, both for the management of those symptoms and the choice of treatment options. Carers and clinical psychiatrists may ask whether open challenges to delusional beliefs and distorted memories are always the best policy, if these cognitions can be shown to play an important role in the attempt by service users to preserve knowledge or acquire new information. We already know that the preservation and acquisition of relevant knowledge and self knowledge can contribute to an enhanced sense of self, increased wellbeing, and more efficient communication with others. 
Suggestions that might emerge from my investigation also have the potential to change attitudes towards delusional beliefs and distorted memories occurring in psychiatric conditions, and towards more common 'imperfect' cognitions in the non-clinical population. When it comes to the divide between normal and pathological, it should be acknowledged that there is continuity between delusional and non-delusional beliefs, accurate and distorted memories. All beliefs, pathological or normal, can be unresponsive to evidence (possibly to different degrees), and all memories, no matter how accurate, can be thought of as more or less successful attempts at reconstructing the past by using fading clues. The emphasis on epistemic innocence should serve to reiterate the importance of viewing cognition as a fallible, imperfect but ultimately extremely powerful tool in the hands of finite and limited social beings like humans.
Dissemination outside academia and public engagement will take a number of different and complementary forms during and after the Fellowship. The project webpage will be available for interested parties to use, and both clinical practitioners from the Royal College of Psychiatrists Philosophy Interest Group and groups of service users and carers in the Coventry and Birmingham area will be invited to view information on it and subscribe to the relevant Twitter feed. Some of these stakeholders will be invited to take part in the project workshop and provide their valuable input and feedback in discussion time. In addition to this, there will be focus groups with clinical practitioners, service users and carers after the end of the Fellowship, supported by the University of Birmingham which is committed to promoting public engagement of funded research. During these meetings, participants will have an opportunity to hear about the Fellowship outcomes, express their views about the potential epistemic benefits of delusions and distorted memories given their first-hand experience, and think about practical applications of the findings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>118954</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wise choices</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3E6CD563-B397-4EC9-8E14-BB895723A72E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Panel discussion and Q&amp;amp;A were recorded in a podcast which had over 10,000 downloads.
