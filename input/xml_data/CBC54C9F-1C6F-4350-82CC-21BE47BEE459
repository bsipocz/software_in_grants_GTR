It will focus principally upon identifying the type, quantity and quality of household furnishings and furniture in use in the greater houses. This is completely new territory since, outside music and literature, the effect of the Renaissance on Scotland has been underestimated or ignored. Using, primarily, the rich contemporary household inventories, this research will provide a historical frame and chronology for the NMS' national collections, within the context of similar material held by other organisations - such as local museums and the National Trust for Scotland. Building upon recent architectural scholarship, it should deepen if not revolutionise our perception and our understanding of Scottish culture during the Renaissance. It should also add to our knowledge of where the furniture came from and the patterns of patronage that caused them to be in Scotland. In particular, the research will address the hitherto unacknowledged role played by soft furnishings and textiles.\nThe doctoral task will be to relate manuscript evidence - primarily inventories and testaments, but also, where available, records of commissioning or of import - to artefacts; and then to relate that to illuminate contemporary research about the use of the buildings. The outcome will influence both the way we understand the period and - in particular - the NMS' approach to describing and presenting the artefacts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of this research: The beneficiaries will be both internal and external to NMS at a professional level; and then the wider interested public. \na. As research progresses, the student will present at periodic seminars for discussion with \n colleagues; and during the process there will be at least two seminars for discussion with other \n holders of furnishings (eg other museums and the National Trust for Scotland)\nb. NMS will make available on-line the database for furniture/furnishings arising from inventories. \nc. All relevant descriptive text relating to museum displays will be reviewed in the light of the \n findings.\nd. There will be a major conference to discuss furnishings in a Scottish renaissance \n household to share information and interpretation with holders of other collections.\ne. Consideration will be given either to a publication or the dedication of a discrete part of the NMS \n website to this topic.\nf. Relevant publications - including the potential of a new catalogue - will be considered.\n\nThis research has the potential to make a fundamental impact upon people's perceptions of the pre-enlightenment culture of Scotland, relevant not just to national self-respect, but to the national heritage agenda. As a consequence, beneficiaries should include Historic Scotland, heritage organisations and stately home owners, Regional Museums, and - to some extent - tourist organisations. It should be of particular interest to conservationists of buildings, paper and books, textiles or furniture, and to interested organisations such as the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland, NADFAS, Historic Houses Association, the National Trust for Scotland and the Vivat and the Landmark Trusts.\n\nThe benefit should begin to accrue in the first year, but will mature in year 3, and then become widespread through publication etc by year 5.\n\nSpecific potential beneficiaries beyond NMS should include: \nRegional museums in Scotland\nThe Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland\nNADFAS\nThe Historic Houses Association\nThe National Trust for Scotland\nThe Vivat Trust\nThe Landmark Trusts\nUniversities/scholars with an interest in Renaissance or material culture\nGlasgow, Oxford and York Universities, the Sorbonne, Catholic University of Leuvain.\nConservationists of buildings, paper and books, textiles or furniture.\nOwners of relevant artefacts.\n\nThe principal benefit to the above will be the creation of a framework for understanding the material culture of the Scottish Renaissance -particularly through attendance at seminars/conferences, and relevant papers/articles. By the integration with NMS, this research has the ability to influence material culture scholarship at the very heart of the country.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024437/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
