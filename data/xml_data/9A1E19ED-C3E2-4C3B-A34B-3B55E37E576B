Managing the urinary bladder is of the first importance to clinicians and patients following trauma to the spinal cord. Historically, kidney damage due to high bladder pressures and/or infection was the usual cause of death resulting from such an injury. Infections still raise mortality and morbidity, exacerbated by the risk of antibiotic resistance. In order to achieve urination-i.e. complete voluntary micturition (CVM) and as an alternative to the expensive process of intermittent sterile catheterisation, a neuroprosthesis for controlling the bladder after spinal cord injury (SCI) was developed by GS Brindley at the MRC Neurological Prostheses Unit in London 30 years ago. The Brindley method employs sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) but is not popular in Europe, in terms of the fraction of the SCI population treated, because implantation of the device is accompanied by cutting the sacral posterior (sensory) nerve roots (rhizotomy) to prevent reflex incontinence during bladder filling and improve stimulated voiding. Clearly there is a need for a new neuroprosthesis that is more widely acceptable (primarily because no rhizotomy is necessary) and which, in addition, reduces the lifetime cost of care. The aim of this project is to design and demonstrate such a device. 

Since its introduction, the Brindley method has been improved in several ways in attempts to address the problems mentioned. However, in spite of these developments, at present (a) no satisfactory, practical method exists for detecting the onset of bladder contractions in a chronic implant and, (b) no method is available to inform the patient of the level of bladder fullness to indicate when the bladder should be emptied. These are critical obstacles to the design of a complete prosthesis and our proposed solution is to use the bladder neural signals themselves since surgically implanted electrodes are essential anyway (i.e. for stimulation). A suitable site for the electrodes is the extradural roots; this is surgically attractive and electrodes are routinely implanted here in the Brindley procedure. In order that the nerves are similar to those in man, it is essential to use a large experimental animal as a preclinical model and we propose to use sheep for these experiments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is about the treatment of urinary incontinence, consequent of damage to the spinal cord. Trauma to the spinal cord causes permanent paralysis and incontinence. In the UK, around 50,000 people live with SCI, with about 1,000 new cases every year amounting to a total annual cost of approximately &amp;pound;1 billion or approximately 1% of the total NHS budget [see www.spinal-research.org]. Worldwide, SCI affects about 2.5 million people with approximately 130,000 new cases each year. For patients, having a satisfactory method of bladder management is the highest priority for paraplegics and the second highest, after restoration of the hand, for tetraplegics.
At present, in Britain, the most popular method for bladder management following SCI is intermittent catheterisation supported by the use of anticholinergic drugs. This is expensive (&amp;pound;6k/annum per patient) and the drug side effects are unpleasant. As an alternative, the Brindley neuroprosthesis is manufactured by Finetech Medical Ltd of Welwyn Garden City and approximately 4,000 have now been implanted worldwide. However, due to the need for destructive surgery to ensure its successful function (cutting certain sensory neural pathways 'rhizotomy'), the method is not generally popular. The new prosthesis described in this proposal avoids the need for a rhizotomy and so removes the main obstacle to the device being widely adopted by patients and clinicians. In addition, the process of technology transfer will be greatly assisted by the innovative First-in-Man initiative at UCL, which is designed to help get new devices like this through the current regulatory process and into commercial production. 

A successful outcome to the proposed project would allow the new neuroprosthesis to be designed, tested in SCI patients and become the treatment of choice for complete spinal lesions (~40% of SCI patients have no residual sensation from the sacral region). This will have a significant impact on society, as people ling with SCI will benefit tremendously from the developed technology and experience a better quality of life. Economically, too, the impact of the research is likely to be high, as the amount of NHS budget going towards people living with SCI will be dramatically reduced.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>316873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P018947/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
