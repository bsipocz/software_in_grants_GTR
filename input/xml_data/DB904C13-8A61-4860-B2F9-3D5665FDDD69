Peace movements and German politics, 1979-1989/90.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/F013442/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>During the 1980s, East and West Germans protested against nuclear weapons and what they regarded as the militarisation of politics in their own society. In 1989/90, the Wall came down, turning the debate over the stationing of nuclear weapons on German soil into the last great political battle of the Cold War. 'The Last Battle of the Cold War' provides readers with the first German-German history of the peace movements of the 1980s. It tells the story of how activists countered Cold War fears by developing and practising ideas for a world beyond the bipolar logic of Cold War tensions. It also highlights how their activism profoundly changed the ways in which Germans have thought about and imagined issues of war and peace. This book will thus move beyond the conventional narratives of the Cold War which tend to ignore peace movements as irrelevant, vilify them as blunt instruments of communist power politics, or highlight their contribution to single-handedly ending the Cold War.\n All politics during the Cold War took place under the threat of nuclear annihilation. But what difference did this make? In order to explore this question, this project will focus on the way in which peace movements in Germany, the divided country at the epicentre of the Cold War in Europe, addressed this question during the last decade of the conflict. The last battle of the Cold War in 1980s' Germany was not waged on battlefields with traditional tanks and weapons, by officers directing armies from command hills. It was fought between East and West Germans and their governments within the civilian parameters of politics, when Germans took to the streets in their hundreds of thousands. They protested against the threat of annihilation posed by the stationing of even more nuclear weapons on German soil and challenged the binary logic of communism/anti-communism that permeated Cold War political discussions. \n Although protesters, especially in East Germany, had to cope with a substantial amount of police brutality and state surveillance, the essence of this battle lay in the struggle over political symbols and images. Analysing the symbolic meanings of the East and West German peace movement within the context of German politics will, therefore, form the core of this project. By paying particular attention to the connections and mutual observations between the two movements, East and West, within the context of peace politics at the time, the project will be able to unveil the profound impact of the Cold War arms race on German politics and society during the 1980s and offer important insights into the character of the Cold War. \n Cultural symbols might easily be dismissed as a sideshow in the real power-political conflicts. Yet this project seeks to show that the character of the Cold War as a war lay precisely in symbols and images, transmitted and magnified through the media. Real politics and symbolic politics could no longer be separated. As an all-out nuclear war never occurred, it could only be imagined, through the military's combat exercises and government officials' calculations of the destructive power of nuclear weapons on the one hand; and through the fears of anti-nuclear-weapons protesters on the other. These simulations and images of nuclear war, and the fears they created, formed the essence of the Cold War. The Cold War was primarily waged through attacks on people's imaginations, by trying to make them believe in the logic and 'rationality' of nuclear deterrence and in the bipolar ideological opposition between capitalism and communism. Activists challenged these central parameters of Cold War politics and developed their own collective imagination. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-06-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23179</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F013442/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
