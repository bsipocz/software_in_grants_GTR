Flow</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M011224/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposal sits within the broad field of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE), an area of mathematics with wide-ranging applications from practical issues in engineering, science and industry to some of the most difficult problems in geometry and topology. Such an equation could model for example a chemical or industrial process, be a rule to correctly define the price of a financial option, or more abstractly describe the shape or the evolution of a geometric object. It is the last mentioned type of PDE that this proposal focuses on.

Relating the local geometry and global topology of manifolds constitutes one of the main aims of differential geometry. While this area of pure mathematics has always seen steady progress, it was the introduction of techniques from analysis - and in particular heat flow methods - that revolutionised it completely and led to some of the most spectacular recent results such as Perelman's resolution of the Poincar&amp;eacute; and Geometrisation Conjectures, the 1/4-pinched Differentiable Sphere Theorem of Brendle and Schoen, and Brendle's proof of the Lawson Conjecture. It therefore comes as no surprise that the report of the EPSRC Pure Mathematics Workshop 2012 as well as the International Review of Mathematical Sciences 2010 come to the conclusion that the part of geometry that needs most strengthening in the UK is the connection between geometric analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations. I propose to further develop the UK's research infrastructure in this field through world-leading research that borrows modern ideas from analysis, geometry and topology and unites and transforms them into completely new and powerful techniques and results. 

More precisely, the proposed research consists of the following themes: understanding higher-dimensional Ricci Flow singularities, investigating stability properties of singularity models, developing theories of generic Ricci Flow in arbitrary dimensions and of weak Ricci Flow indimension three, and analysing the singularity formation in the Harmonic Ricci Flow. While these themes are all connected and intertwined, I have made an effort to crystallise out formally independent objectives. The results obtained from the proposed research will not only have a major impact on geometry and topology, but also open up the field of geometric flows for applications in physics and engineering.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Nonlinear partial differential equations, which form the heart of this research proposal, have widespread impact from academic science to engineering, industry, finance and society. A substantial part of the economic and societal impact of this project will be generated via other academic work based on the research in this proposal, in particular through PDE theorists, physicists, biologists, material and computer scientists, and engineers. The research in this proposal will provide these researchers with state-of-the-art tools and knowledge, thus improving the effectiveness and sustainability of several research areas.

A large proportion of the proposed research has the potential for industrial applications. While it is virtually impossible to give accurate predictions about future applications, geometric flows are currently being used for example for image processing devices, in particular for de-noising, enhancement and super-resolution of low-quality images. This technology finds applications ranging from facial recognition to medical scanners. As of today, the UK is not at the forefront of this development, which is partially due to the fact that it does not yet have a deeply ingrained tradition in the area of geometric analysis. The proposed research project will help to improve the current situation and establish an environment where such development can occur.

An area which particularly benefits from research in geometric analysis is the financial sector, which is central to the UK's economy, currently accounting for a third of the nation's gross domestic product. Nonlinear partial differential equations are crucial to financial mathematics where they are for example used in order to correctly price European and American options or for calibration. This fact results in a heavy demand for well-trained mathematicians with a background in nonlinear PDE by the financial industry and hence supporting this research area is essential for the economic prosperity of the UK. In particular, by strengthening the Analysis and Geometry Group at Queen Mary University, we will be able to train highly skilled researchers and to provide them with the knowledge and technical abilities necessary to work in challenging positions in the financial sector.

Finally, geometric flow methods have produced some of the most impressive intellectual achievements of the last hundred years, Perelman's proof of the Poincar&amp;eacute; conjecture being the most prominent example. This has considerably enhanced public awareness of mathematics over the past years which helps to secure a steady flow of students into this subject and science in general.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100521</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Mathematical Institute Oxford</gtr:department><gtr:description>Research Collaboration with Melanie Rupflin</gtr:description><gtr:id>BCA7EB9F-9F93-4809-B56D-6225FFD18130</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article: Smooth long-time existence of Harmonic Ricci Flow on surfaces, J.

In particular, the findings so far includuded:

- Together with Melanie Rupflin (Oxford), we made significant progress on the 2-dimensional Harmonic Ricci Flow, proving that no singularities can form in finite time. Geometric flows typically develop singularities both in finite time and infinite time - ruling out the former ones for this particular flow is an important result and was one of my main grant objectives.

- In joint work with Ben Sharp (Warwick, previously Pisa), we obtained geometric and topological control of minimal surfaces with a bound on their Morse index. Previously, only the converse of this was known. These results can be considered very important improvements of our understanding of minimal surfaces.

- Together with Robert Haslhofer (Toronto) and Or Hershkovits (Stanford, previously NYU) we studied mean curvature flow with surgery. This is a very deep theory to deal with the sigularities arising in the mean curvature flow and we developed some important modifications which allowed us to prove interesting topological consequences. In particular, we found new results on embedded spheres and tori (satisfying a certain convexity assumption) and proved a result that can be seen as a higher-dimensional version of the Smale conjecture.

- Together with Huy Nguyen we studied extensions of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem. This formula gives an intriguing connection between the topology and the geometry of a manifold and is considered on of the most important results in Differential Geometry. Our extension allows the object of study to have isolated singular points and the results we found are the first of its kind for manifolds in dimensions higher than two.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My results will be further used by other researchers in pure mathematics (in particular geometry and analysis). The articles which are outcomes of this grant were cited and used already by several other mathematicians and it is expected that their impact will get more important within the next few years. Most of the impact will be academic in pure mathematics, with indirect impact potentially created at a later stage (e.g. geometric flows are important tools in image analysis and understanding them better might - in the long run - yield further improvemenets in this or related industrial areas). 

My finidings have also been communicated at several international workshops and meetings and I am conviced that they will lead to further interesting ideas in pure mathematics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6FB01625-C658-4ED0-9BB7-4CD7C2E2F394</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8432f7edeb9.23443332</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A5251453-C7EE-4A86-9C1A-52C3AA0B67A8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Qualitative and quantitative estimates for minimal hypersurfaces with bounded index and area</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions of the American Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8f90b0b0d0a394547fb230ebcc2a35f4"><gtr:id>8f90b0b0d0a394547fb230ebcc2a35f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buzano R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a995b2dd19621.04295778</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2F799886-0BEC-4E53-ACDB-A1E432227D1B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Smooth long-time existence of Harmonic Ricci Flow on surfaces</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the London Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8f90b0b0d0a394547fb230ebcc2a35f4"><gtr:id>8f90b0b0d0a394547fb230ebcc2a35f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buzano R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d851f40d7ce5.24629975</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FB1E21D0-6489-4B4A-9866-0578400E9A35</gtr:id><gtr:title>Qualitative and quantitative estimates for minimal hypersurfaces with bounded index and area</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions of the American Mathematical Society (to appear)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d775db7c7fcfaffb670bb5adf6d4bb5f"><gtr:id>d775db7c7fcfaffb670bb5adf6d4bb5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>R.
