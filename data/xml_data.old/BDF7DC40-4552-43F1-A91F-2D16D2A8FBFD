We are interested in mapping the ways in which engagement with private law might by turns enhance and restrict political engagement between opposing groups and between the citizen and the state. Many critical legal and political scholars worry that our politics are hollowed out by over-reliance on litigation and regulation to fulfil political aims. A number of questions flow from this position:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Is the difficulty amplified when the law at issue is private rather than public law?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Is a resort to private law inevitably a depoliticizing move, or does private law open up novel means of political struggle?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Does the formal, technical nature of private law generate peculiar advantages for political actors?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Does private law inevitably bolster existing disparities in political power, or does it contain means by which imbalances can be addressed?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Are contract and tort cases ever as significant for politics as civil rights litigation, or does private illegality inevitably lack political cachet?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The seminar series will be of direct benefit to two main groups. First, it will benefit the practising lawyers who speak at and attend the seminars (listed in the Case for Support) as well as those who use the seminar materials which are made available online. The seminars will provide opportunities to exchange knowledge and practical experience with other practitioners who are working on fast-developing trends in private law. Practitioners will also benefit from the opportunity to discuss relevant legal and policy developments and litigation strategy in an environment which lends itself to creative, theoretically informed and contextualised reflection. We also expect that the series will be of indirect benefit to their clients in the years following the seminar, as lawyers adapt the insights gleaned to their practice. In addition to the lawyers invited to participate as speakers and discussants, we will reserve workshop places for practitioners interested in attending for Continuing Professional Development purposes.

Second, the series will benefit activists and policy-makers. All of the non-academic speakers and discussants, and some additional participants at the seminars will be invited because of their particular experience with the impact of private law on the case study areas. Other participants who work in those areas, but have engaged less directly with private law, will also be invited to attend and participate. All of these participants will benefit from the opportunity to develop their awareness and understanding of recent developments in private law, and to draw on the insights of the academic participants in framing their own policy agendas. Again, the online materials generated by the seminar will be of interest to a wide range of policy-makers and activists.

The 'public' can bear many meanings. It has positive associations with public goods: shared order, community, commonality, and welfare, but also with publicity, visibility and openness. There is a further sense of 'the public' in political theory as the space in which members of a shared polity come together to participate in political life, and potentially as the space of 'the political', of dissensus, in which rare moments of radical democratic action become possible. 

Traditionally, we do not associate private law with this kind of public. Private law is, thus, often understood as dissolving political considerations; reducing them to matters of private (market) relations; to choice, certainty, commodity, and self-interest; making the incomparable comparable . On this account, private law depoliticizes whatever it touches - there is no place where private law and the political might encounter one another; no possibility of friction. 

Private Law and Neoliberal Ordering.

In contemporary legal studies, new attention is focused on the deliberate governmental instrumentalisation of the apparently depoliticizing qualities of private law. Public property is privatised, public services are 'contracted out' to private agents, tortious liability undermines collective activities and suffuses them with risk , and so on. In acts of privatization through law, aspects of 'publicness', transparency, commonality, and openness - whatever their myriad flaws - are inevitably subverted. Moreover, the precarious, but purportedly self-governing subjects of private law fit neatly with these projects. Private legal constructs, because they depend on the voluntary assumption and administration of obligations , direct subjects to regulate themselves in accordance with broader agendas , bolstered by the simple moral language of duty, ownership and promise. The atomised , modular structures of private law seek to stabilise our most intimate dealings; our networks of belonging; the spaces in which we dwell. (It is perhaps for this reason that private law has been such an important tool of colonial discipline). 
But there is a double dispossession here. In the event of day-to-day conflict or ultimately, in the event of litigation, political disputes become peculiarly 'juridified'; framed and adjudicated upon in inappropriate legal terms which might destroy their political essence . For instance, the justice of private law is traditionally framed as 'corrective ' - determined by the interests of the parties, and a compatible individualistic conception of the public good. Feminist critics, in particular, have demonstrated how, in this respect, private law selectively abstracts from social relations, and disembeds conflicts from their political context . In particular, private law is understood as reducing 'political' considerations to the blunter efficacy of private (market) relations; to rational calculation, efficiency, exchange, commodity and self-interest . This is why private law may have difficulty in coming to terms with claims from harm and suffering, relationality or tradition . At best, 'the political' in private law becomes the loose common sense of 'public policy' or welfare. Private law's exclusions and disorientations work to eliminate deeper issues of distribution of power from public consideration. 

Private law's subversions of these sorts of political ends tend to be experienced as dispossession, silencing and injury. Private law repels some subjects even as it lends force to obligations between others. By its overwhelming association with property and capital, in particular, private law lends value to some lives as it devalues others. By its insistence on the appearance of self-regulation, it undermines the life projects of more vulnerable actors. The broader consequences of that devaluation move into sharp focus when we consider how fundamental private transactions around property may be to recognition in community. This is what Patricia Williams senses in her famous essay, 'On Being the Object of Property'. Awareness of the power of private transactions to confer or cruelly deny a kind of recognition sharpens our responses when in neoliberal times we become aware of lives hemmed in by the private legal acts of others - those subject, but not parties, to contracts between powerful actors, or those affected by distributions of risk between mass tortfeasors. Consider, for instance, asylum seekers housed, or transported for deportation, under government 'contracting out' of public services to G4S. These subjects become the stock-in-trade of oppressive and inscrutable transactions, which they cannot resist or influence on the formal terms of private law . 
Because of this focus on strategies of discipline, divestment and dispersal, there is a temptation to think of possible new lives of private law only in terms of loss to the public. This collection, however, by its focus on a particular conception of the public, not as a set of resources which can be depleted, but as a range of possible disruptive or creative encounters, provides new routes into imagining the public lives of private law. This collection argues that it is also possible to think about private law as generating spaces within which to enact minority political claims, and actions which dissent from neoliberal ordering. 

Private Obligations and Everyday Resistance.

At the heart of the justice contemplated by private law is a 'pair', or cluster, which regulates itself for itself . Acknowledging this much is not simply to repeat the classical assumption that private law is autonomous in some rough sense from wider political claims . Repeated critical interventions have insisted that the core constructs of private law cannot be understood as minimalist or neutral. They are governmental projects underwritten by state violence, and shored up by gendered, raced and classed divisions . Thus, private law always gestures towards and is enfolded in political contests. As such, in seeking to regulate their life projects under private law, individuals are always acting in relation to broader political struggles, and never entirely free to pursue their own projects. At the same time, private law's commitment to individual autonomy permits parties some opportunities to carve out footholds within which to attempt to assert control over the obligations imposed on them. The constructs of private law might enable the creation and reproduction of forms of association, self-representation and mutual recognition which depart from dominant norms. Using private legal constructs, we can bind one another in ways which have less to do with the solitary navigation of externally imposed uncertainty, than with deep relational solidarity performed through the voluntary assumption of interpersonal and communal duties . In this sense, the public life of private law encompasses processes of private empowerment for new political ends. A new strand of scholarship in transnational legal studies elaborates on this insight across a broader canvas, promising that private law can be manipulated to produce instances of 'law beyond the state'. 

Second, precisely because private law extends its reach into every-day and often intimate transactions, its unifying constructs are vulnerable to fragmentation. Precisely because private law aspires to inclusivity; to a capacity to govern and respond to an endless range of social activities, its animating concepts are fluid and open-ended. As such, it tends to excess, and it tends to leave remainders. It cannot incorporate everything within its bounds. Private law's expansive, empty forms are particularly susceptible to challenge by the party who refuses to properly orient herself to private law's dominant demands. Writing about 'subversive property', Sarah Keenan argues that subjects 'can change a space by refusing to leave it, or by refusing to orient themselves in the way the space was designed Through introducing things that do not belong or bodies that are not properly oriented, subversive propertymakes possible a reshaping of space'. Private law constructs can be strategically avoided, mocked, played with, profaned or refused in ways which re-admit or re-animate the political commitments buried within private obligation. We can navigate private legal obligations with a certain sly literalism, in attempts to avoid their full weight or import. We can, in sum, force, or insinuate, new kinds of social obligation into traditional legal structures. Thus, the inventiveness, and the entrepreneurial capacity for adapting to uncertainty, that we attribute to the subjects of private law under neoliberalism may serve to unsettle hegemonic power relations. The classic example in property law is the squat, which enacts an alternative property order, or recalls the unjustness of the prevailing one, by refusing dominant relations of ownership.
 
Private Law Doctrine and Resistant Litigation.

Finally, private law doctrine may itself be more receptive to newness than we typically appreciate. The capacity for resistance to governing universals is an inherent feature of private law. Gary Watt writes about 'outlaw equity' to describe equity's capacity to recognise relationships which fall outside the strict letter of the law. As parties have struggled to bring new norms and projects within the sphere of private law, private law itself has attained a degree of pluralism. Some scholars - notably Roberto Unger in his discussion of 'deviationist doctrine' - argue that it is by unpacking private law's contradictions and pluralities that we will eke out spaces within which to contest oppressive 'public' commitments. 

Moreover, in court, private law's justice, with its emphasis on direct intersubjective recognition and accountability, on horizontal responsibility, on the vindication of discrete wrongs, on concrete remedies and on the equal standing of one party in relation to the other, may open up possibilities for justice that are less often imagined at public law. In recent years, for example, we have seen victims of historical institutional abuse turn to negligence law in an effort to hold governments accountable for the malfeasance of the predecessors. As feminist legal theory reminds us, those who depart from private law's core governing assumptions will face difficulty in litigation . Private law may best, offer only an 'uncanny or unsettled personhood', but this status may provide enough purchase on the justice system to achieve limited political aims. 

Mapping alternatives.

Bearing in mind what we have said about its colonising power, there are limits to what can be achieved through deliberately contestatory engagement with private law. Private law inevitably encourages the repetition and entrenchment of certain expectations at the expense of others. Insofar as there are certain structures which are 'givens' within private law, there will be compromises and adaptations to make. The terrain of change is asymmetrical, and not all efforts to mobilize private law's relations and resources will succeed. Private law itself will likely adapt to outside incursions. 
Nevertheless, our argument is that the privatisation of political claims through contract, tort and property cannot be understood in terms of their total containment or defusion. The essays in this collection use a variety of detailed case studies to map tensions and contradictions within new strategic deployments of private law - between containment and escape; obligation and possibility, discipline and unsettlement. They enrich contemporary British discussion of private law by introducing new framings of private law's engagement with the political. They advance a set of analyses which speaks to private law's embeddedness in urgent contemporary political struggles.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The PI is currently exploring aspects of these findings in conjunction with visual artists Jesse Jones and Sarah Browne as part of the In The Shadow of the State Project (http://www.artscouncil.ie/in-the-shadow-of-the-state/)
