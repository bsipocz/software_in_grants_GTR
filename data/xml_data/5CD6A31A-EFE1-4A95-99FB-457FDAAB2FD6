Extreme as these different conditions may appear, Earth's climate has nevertheless remained within the bounds that have allowed life to continue for a few thousand million years. The Earth system contains some very ingenious mechanisms that help regulate its climate so that it never becomes too hot, or too cold, to kill off life altogether. These mechanisms include chemical weathering of continental rocks, burial of organic carbon, and changes in the flora of the oceans and continents. It usually takes many millions of years for climate to shift to either generally warmer conditions or cooler conditions, and these conditions are then maintained for many tens of millions of years. However, recent research has shown that there have been a number episodes in the past when temperatures world-wide have suddenly soared over intervals as short as a few tens or hundreds of years, and that these high temperatures lasted for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years before recovering to pre-warming levels. In geological terms, these episodes lasted a relatively short time, and they were entirely unlike the more gradual, million-year changes. But we also know that many of these sudden episodes of severe global warming coincided with so-called 'mass extinctions' when very large numbers of plant and animal species suddenly died out. Equally, there have been relatively short periods when the Earth suddenly cooled and there was a rapid expansion of glacial environments. The subject of our study is a critical episode of sudden global cooling that occurred some 14 million years ago and resulted in major growth of the Antarctic ice sheet. This episode is one of the 4 major steps in the gradual cooling of Earth's surface that started around 50 million years ago, and which has continued to the present day. Despite its great importance, the causes of the sudden cooling are poorly understood. The purpose of our study is twofold. First, we want to understand why the Earth abruptly flipped from one state to another, from relatively warm to relatively cold. And second, we want to use this example of global cooling to examine how other aspects of the Earth system responded at that time. How do we find out this information, and where is it recorded? The sediments that are deposited in the world's oceans are derived from the continents and from the remains of marine organisms. The composition of these sediments has changed over time in response to changing environmental conditions. We can thus use the chemistry of marine sediments as proxies for seawater temperature, continental weathering rate, and so on. By looking in detail at the changes in composition across a section of sedimentary rock, which represents a 'slice' of time, we can then infer how temperature and weathering have varied over this interval. A succession of sedimentary rocks known as the Monterey Formation that is now exposed along the coast in California contains an excellent, high resolution record of changes in seawater chemistry over the major cooling period about 14 million years ago. We have already completed a successful pilot study that has established an outline geochemistry and an accurate, high-resolution timescale for this succession through the use of a built-in astronomical 'clock', so we can readily locate our position in absolute time. Our objective now is to determine which mechanism caused the Earth to cool at that time, and what the environmental consequences were then. At the present day, we face a major challenge in predicting the future course of Earth's climate. A further objective is to obtain reliable information about the behaviour of the Earth system in the past that will be able to inform us better of how to deal with current and future environmental issues.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-03-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174452</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Open University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ocean acidification</gtr:description><gtr:id>24AAAF03-AEFE-403E-9EC0-0E5056E060CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>proof of concept.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54639efdf3c776.17857080-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Analyses on the foraminifera for shell mass, size and thickness</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Pristine forams from the mid-miocene cooling</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Amsterdam</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Origins of present day flora diversity</gtr:description><gtr:id>D7C5107E-C466-46EE-B05B-FA5C5465721A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pilot study showing there is potential for a large project to look at the origins of flora diversity from this unique palaeorecord.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54639e3f839c38.67852901-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Processing for palynomorphs</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Samples and other data, in-depth knowledge of field site, geological timescale</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>TEX86 Palaeotemperature proxy</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C415CF8-AA03-4304-9844-752F6F986C38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>proof of concept and that the samples were robust</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54639d16a3a543.93921674-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Analysis of samples for Tex86</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Samples and other data</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Milton Keynes Science Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>571EE639-06BE-42ED-8E05-0B5498719D4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Display and forum sparked interest in geological time and climate change

This cooling coincided with large-scale growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet and of sea ice in the Arctic. It is one of the four major steps in the gradual cooling of Earth's surface that started around 50 million years ago, and which has continued to the present day. Our data set of over 5000 measurements allowed us to conclude that the cooling was caused by the combination of two mechanisms: an increase in the amount of weathering and the congruence and variability of astronomical parameters.

Data set: We studied a unique section along the California coast where between 16 and 13 million ago, sedimentary rocks rich in microfossils and organic matter were deposited in the ocean. The section is unusual because it is exceptionally well-preserved providing us with a complete, layer-by-layer record of changes in the ocean chemistry and biota over this time period. Our large data set from the field and laboratory provide us with integrated proxies for changes in temperature, the carbon cycle, productivity and the rate of global weathering. 

Objectives: This project has achieved its objectives by: (1) providing the first onshore, exposure-based, high-resolution record through the mid-Miocene that is both stratigraphically complete and undisturbed by bioturbation or mass flow processes. Eleven distinct mudrock facies were defined and related to palaeoceanographic changes; (2) constructing a Milankovitch-scale timescale for the mid-Miocene (15.82 to 13.18 Ma); (3) demonstrating that there are 200 yr and 3000 yr primary variations in rock composition and (4) establishing an integrated geochemical and stratigraphic approach to test the original four proposed mechanisms for mid-Miocene cooling. 

Part of one of the original objectives (Sr-isotope proxy for weathering) was amended as the tied studentship was not funded. The Ar-Ar radiometric dating which formed a small part of another objective was not as successful as anticipated because the crystals we analysed had not behaved as a closed system and thus they did not yield meaningful dates. However this was rectified because the diatom biostratigraphy expertise of the PDRA we appointed allowed us to produce new biostratigraphic ages that were not originally anticipated.

Details on the outcomes: From our measurements, we have found that there are regular, cyclic changes in the composition of the sedimentary rocks on a variety of scales ranging from 1 cm to 20 m. These cyclic changes have enabled us to: (1) construct a high-resolution timescale for the succession; (2) show that different parameters within the astronomical clock have affected global temperature and the global carbon cycle. Our study has also found that the succession contains exceptionally well-preserved foraminifera and organic-compounds; both of these data sets show an overall change in global temperature of 3 to 4 degrees Celsius during this event. Using the Os-isotope proxy for the amount of weathering on these same rocks and we showed that just prior to mid-Miocene cooling there was an increase in the amount of weathering. 

Further work: Our discovery of the exceptional preservation of the microfossils and organic matter together with the completeness of this record enabled a follow on studentship developing the Mo-isotope system as a measure of the areal extent of oceanic de-oxygenation and pilot projects on ocean acidification and the mid Miocene increase in plant diversity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There was no pathways to impact statement or funding at the time the grant was awarded.
