These include gas meters and lights in our homes, healthcare devices, water distribution systems and cars. Increasingly, such objects are digitally connected and some are transitioning from cellular network connections (M2M) to using the internet: e.g. smart meters and cars - ultimately self-driving cars may revolutionise transport. This trend is driven by numerous forces. The connection of objects and use of their data can cut costs (e.g. allowing remote control of processes) creates new business opportunities (e.g. tailored consumer offerings), and can lead to new services (e.g. keeping older people safe in their homes).
 
This vision of interconnected physical objects is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. The examples above not only illustrate the vast potential of such technology for economic and societal benefit, they also hint that such a vision comes with serious challenges and threats. For example, information from a smart meter can be used to infer when people are at home, and an autonomous car must make quick decisions of moral dimensions when faced with a child running across on a busy road. This means the Internet of Things needs to evolve in a trustworthy manner that individuals can understand and be comfortable with. It also suggests that the Internet of Things needs to be resilient against active attacks from organised crime, terror organisations or state-sponsored aggressors. 

Therefore, this project creates a Hub for research, development, and translation for the Internet of Things, focussing on privacy, ethics, trust, reliability, acceptability, and security/safety: PETRAS, (also suggesting rock-solid foundations) for the Internet of Things. The Hub will be designed and run as a 'social and technological platform'. It will bring together UK academic institutions that are recognised international research leaders in this area, with users and partners from various industrial sectors, government agencies, and NGOs such as charities, to get a thorough understanding of these issues in terms of the potentially conflicting interests of private individuals, companies, and political institutions; and to become a world-leading centre for research, development, and innovation in this problem space. 

Central to the Hub approach is the flexibility during the research programme to create projects that explore issues through impactful co-design with technical and social science experts and stakeholders, and to engage more widely with centres of excellence in the UK and overseas. Research themes will cut across all projects: Privacy and Trust; Safety and Security; Adoption and Acceptability; Standards, Governance, and Policy; and Harnessing Economic Value. Properly understanding the interaction of these themes is vital, and a great social, moral, and economic responsibility of the Hub in influencing tomorrow's Internet of Things. For example, a secure system that does not adequately respect privacy, or where there is the mere hint of such inadequacy, is unlikely to prove acceptable. Demonstrators, like wearable sensors in health care, will be used to explore and evaluate these research themes and their tension. New solutions are expected to come out of the majority of projects and demonstrators, many solutions will be generalisable to problems in other sectors, and all projects will produce valuable insights. A robust governance and management structure will ensure good management of the research portfolio, excellent user engagement and focussed coordination of impact from deliverables.

The Hub will further draw on the expertise, networks, and on-going projects of its members to create a cross-disciplinary language for sharing problems and solutions across research domains, industrial sectors, and government departments. This common language will enhance the outreach, development, and training activities of the Hub.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>932921</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>8.

So this project has, by default, the potential to inform the public debate and the policy debate on IoT as well as shaping practitioners' approach to the design and deployment of IoT devices.

In the first year of the project, several findings were identified with the support of non-academic research users who participate in focus groups and who were keen in embracing the project results, once finalised, to improve their work on IoT.

The articles, talks, and commentary for several media outlets given by the research team are contributing to inform the public debate on the key ethical problems posed by the dissemination of IoT technologies.

At the same time, the research team is finalising the definition of ethical guidelines for the design and deployment of ethically-sound H-IoT. The guidelines have been defined using a multi-stakeholder approach and involving users' representatives, practitioners, policy-makers, and lawyers in the discussion leading to the drafting of the document. Given the feedback that we received, we believe that the proposed guidelines are likely to impact a wide range of practitioners' involved in the design and regulation of H-IoT.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8532DA20-8E6E-4674-8C1A-80006C375AE4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c9b074f20629.99605910</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>IoT provides huge opportunities to improve private and public life while promoting business innovation and economic growth. However, the extensive use of increasingly more data (Big Data), the growing reliance on algorithms in automatic communication and processing (including machine learning), as well as the gradual reduction of human oversight over many decisions pose pressing ethical issues of privacy, trust, transparency, and responsibility. If these issues are overlooked, underestimated or left unresolved, they risk hindering the innovation and the progress that IoT can bring to society at large and to future generations.
For this reason, it is crucial to identify and analyse the most pressing ethical challenges posed by the dissemination of IoT devices. And this is the focus of the project developed by the PETRAS Team at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford.
The following are the most significant achievements for the first year of the project:

Health-related Internet of Things (H-IoT) is proving a valid support to deliver care for elderly users and patients with long-term. However, the design of these devices, Big Data, and the growing reliance on ICTs devices for communication and monitoring purposes pose pressing ethical problems concerning users' autonomy and privacy, as well as transparency and trust. An entire sub-project was, thus, devoted to address specifically these problems. It led to compiling an interdisciplinary meta-analysis of the existing ethical problems concerning H-IoT scoping over 110 articles. The article is entitled
