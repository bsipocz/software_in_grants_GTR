The kidneys are a pair of organs in the abdomen that are essential to life. They function to excrete waste products, as well as maintaining salt water balance and blood pressure. Progressive and irreversible reduction in kidney function over time is termed chronic kidney disease (CKD).

While conservative management of CKD is successful in the early stages of the disease, some patients will unfortunately progress to end-stage (or established) renal disease (ESRD), which is the most severe form of CKD and is defined as an irreversible decline in kidney function that is severe enough to be fatal in the absence of either dialysis or transplantation. Dialysis is a process that substitutes for the kidneys in the tasks of filtering blood and removing waste products while kidney transplantation is an operative procedure to transfer a healthy kidney from a donor to a recipient who has kidney failure. Collectively these two treatments are known as renal replacement therapy (RRT).

In the UK the number of patients on RRT is rising rapidly and between 2000 and 2006 increased by 35%. By 2009 the rate of persons commencing RRT in the UK was 109 per million of the population. For many of these patients kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice as it not only offers freedom from daily or alternate day dialysis, but leads to increased survival, quality of life and is cheaper for the health service. However, kidney transplantation is a victim of its own success and currently the number of patients awaiting a kidney transplant far outweighs the availability of donor organs. This problem is compounded by the fact that due to the technical process of transplantation 10% of kidneys never work and 40% have delayed function. This leads to patients either dying or being forced back onto dialysis, which is devastating for those who have waited many years to receive their transplant in the first place. Even for patients whose transplanted kidneys recover from a delay in graft function there is an adverse impact on the long term outcome of their transplanted kidney.

Our research group seeks to identify drugs that may reduce organ injury caused by the transplantation procedure. We have identified a promising candidate drug that reduces damage in both kidney cells and mouse kidneys in experiments simulating the injury sustained during transplantation. We wish to study this drug in human transplant patients, but prior to this wish to establish exactly how it works.

METHODS
The research will be conducted in the University of Edinburgh by a medical doctor with a research background who is training to be a Transplant Surgeon. He will be supervised by a Professor in Transplant Surgery, a Professor in Renal Medicine and a Professor of Cell Biology. Work will begin in a mouse model, where protective drug treatment will precede the clamping of the blood supply to one kidney and the removal of the other kidney, after which the mouse will recover. This is analogous to the injury caused to the organ during the transplantation procedure. The kidneys and blood from these mice will be analysed using various investigative techniques to determine the mechanism by which the drug protects the kidney. Work will then be extended to kidney cells in the laboratory. The effect of the drug on cellular behaviour of white blood cells, immune cells and kidney cells will be examined as well as the interaction between these cells. We will also evaluate cellular pathways causing inflammation as it is likely that one or more of these pathways is blocked by this drug. Cells will also be subjected to stresses similar to that of an organ being transplanted and the effects of the drug on inflammation pathways measured.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>BACKGROUND
Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) contributes to delayed graft function (DGF) and poorer outcomes in kidney transplantation. Inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has been shown by this research group to reduce kidney injury in a murine IRI model. We are currently investigating an Hsp90 inhibitor with a low toxicity profile in human studies (AT13387). However, the mechanism of protection conferred remains unclear. If delineated, this drug could lead to improved outcomes following transplantation and a better understanding of IRI/inflammatory processes in general. Macrophages are key cells in both the initiation and resolution of renal injury, while T lymphocytes and renal tubular cells participate actively in renal IRI. This study will investigate the specific influence of AT13387 upon these cells.

METHODS
In an established renal IRI model, mice will be pre-treated with AT13387 prior to left renal artery pedicle clamping/contra-lateral nephrectomy. 24 h later, kidney function will determined by serum urea/creatinine and cytokine levels measured. Immunohistochemistry will be used to score morphological injury and establish patterns of cellular infiltration. Flow cytometry of enzymatically dissociated kidneys will assess both cell numbers and phenotype. To study whether AT13387 attenuates renal IRI by modulation of macrophage infiltration and phenotype, CD11b-DTR mice with macrophage-specific expression of human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) will be treated with DT 24 h prior to surgery to induce monocyte/macrophage ablation. The severe combined immune-deficient mouse will be used to establish whether AT13387 attenuates renal IRI by modulation of lymphocyte activation and function. In vitro, murine bone marrow derived macrophages will be prepared and co-cultured with proximal tubular epithelial cells. This model will assess whether AT13387 can attenuate macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity or augment tubular cell modulation of macrophage phenotype.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>a) Patient care &amp;amp; health service
Transplantation is a treatment that is the victim of its own success with demand for organs far exceeding supply. There is a desperate need for kidney donors and there is an increasing disparity between numbers of patients active on the renal transplant list and the availability of donor organs. As a result organ shortage has become one of the most important factors limiting the extension of donor kidney transplantation worldwide. In total there were 6871 patients registered for a kidney transplant on the UK active transplant list by the 31st of March 2011, which is a figure that has risen by 38% since 2002. As a result the number of patients waiting for a kidney transplant now represents 111 patients per million of the population. This has led to a median waiting time for a kidney transplant of 1153 days for an adult patient and 307 days for a paediatric patient. Unfortunately these figures are likely to rise further because there is an increasing prevalence of both ESRD and the earlier stages of CKD that can progress to ESRD. Hypertension and diabetes, the two most common causes of CKD, are also becoming vastly more common. Of patients listed for transplant, approximately 16% died while awaiting a transplant. Of those surviving the first year with a functioning transplant, only 50% of deceased donor transplant recipients are projected to have a functioning transplant at 12 years, only slightly better than results observed 10 years ago. It is vital, therefore, that this precious resource is maximally utilized and negative outcomes minimized. The lack of supply and longer waiting times has forced increasing use of suboptimal deceased donors (high risk, extended criteria or marginal donors) and uncontrolled non-heart-beating donors. Kidneys from such donors are exposed to much greater ischemic damage before recovery and show reduced chances for early as well as long-term function. Our candidate drug (AT13387) has the potential to improve the quality of transplanted organs and convert organs previously deemed unsuitable for use to organs that are useable. Along with a significant impact in reducing the incidence of graft failure in kidney transplant recipients this will help to alleviate the burden of the world wide organ shortage crisis.
b) Research institution &amp;amp; industry
There is significant intellectual property value attached to this project, with our unique clinical data putting us in a strong position. In addition there may be a component of the data which leads to a patentable outcome adding to commercial value. We also believe that we could add to the commercial value of the intellectual property by defining a second indication for the drug since all of the patents for Hsp90 inhibitors currently relate to cell proliferation and cancer, and our line of enquiry utilizes an entirely different property of this group of drugs. In addition AT13387 could potentially be used at a number of different points in the organ retrieval process including in organ preservation solutions, offering expansion of its uses. There is also scope for its use in other transplanted organs and in prevention of IRI in different settings and other organs such as the brain and heart.
c) Principal applicant
This research will facilitate my training as an academic transplant surgeon and I will focus my future career on improving outcomes in organ transplantation. In addition to the many academic skills acquired I have already received technical training in basic laboratory skills and safety, as well as specific techniques such as tissue culture, Western blotting, ELISA, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. I have also already received training in microsurgery, animal handling and completed the Home Office personal licence course. In the near future I will receive training in research methodology through the Wellcome Clinical Research Facility, Biostatistics through the University Public Health Sciences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>140599</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>20F4C4CA-FB63-4A75-AF63-50EE898BA86F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Heat shock protein 90 inhibition abrogates TLR4-mediated NF-kappa b activity and reduces renal ischemia-reperfusion injury</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fc4b762bf84c35cd96f6d728d1c74749"><gtr:id>fc4b762bf84c35cd96f6d728d1c74749</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O'Neill S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0007-1323</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>UMupKEqSutB</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>43EE4BAE-8B5A-44D0-B1E8-55C0C8609973</gtr:id><gtr:title>Debate: should we use variable adjusted life displays (VLAD) to identify variations in performance in general surgery?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC surgery</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b6a44feb8f09ae46e438e78a42d484c3"><gtr:id>b6a44feb8f09ae46e438e78a42d484c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O Neill S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2482</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675ead51a5eb</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>07679BCB-AB66-4CF2-826B-FCEA51F03E86</gtr:id><gtr:title>Differential expression of heat shock proteins in healthy and diseased human renal allografts.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annals of transplantation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fc4b762bf84c35cd96f6d728d1c74749"><gtr:id>fc4b762bf84c35cd96f6d728d1c74749</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O'Neill S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1425-9524</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_22877_27_24113772</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AE50A61A-DE83-47AE-A3F4-2CCEA5FC5DB5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Heat-shock proteins and acute ischaemic kidney injury.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nephron.
