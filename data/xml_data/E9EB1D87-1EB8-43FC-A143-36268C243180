Or maybe you think England are going to win the cricket, because of what you know about the teams and recent results. If you've ever done anything like this, you could accurately be said to have made a statistical classification. You've decided a possible outcome is likely, based on the data you have to hand. In science, this can be enormously powerful. Astronomers, for example, often want to know what types of physics are going on in a galaxy, given how bright it is at different electromagnetic wavelengths. And in medicine, the ability to look at a patient's information and test results and know if they have cancer can be literally life-saving. While people (especially those with years of experience) can become very good at this, in some situations where the data are very complicated it would be great if one could have a computer programme do the classification step and just present you with a reliable answer. That's where this project comes in. We propose to apply Bayesian statistical classification techniques to predict the predisposition of mother-baby pairs to major disorders of prematurity leading to permanent disability in later life. Professor Levene (project co-investigator) and his team have completed a clinical study into the relationship between environmental and genetic variables that may predispose to an increased risk of four major disorders of premature birth (periventricular leukomalacia, chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity and necrotizing enterocolitis). The data are highly heterogeneous and complex and are therefore beyond the conventional methods of analysis. Professor Liddle and Drs Savage, Oliver, Mukherjee and Parkinson are expert from their work in astrophysics with a wide range of advanced Bayesian methods for statistical classification. We will use these methods to extract important medical knowledge from the data from this clinical study. The Bayesian classifier prototype produced by this project will be able to identify future mother-baby pairs who are at particular risk from four major disorders of prematurity. This advanced warning will allow doctors to apply preventative treatment to help avoid these adverse medical outcomes. This will also have an economic benefit in allowing the NHS to treat these conditions more effectively and even avoid said treatment entirely by prevention of the condition.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6260</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/F000081/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EE2392F-9964-4A0B-8C0A-1672FD744F8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Extra-Galactic Astron.&amp;Cosmol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
