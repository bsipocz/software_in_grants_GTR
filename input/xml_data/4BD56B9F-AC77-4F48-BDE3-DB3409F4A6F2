In order to explore the breadth of approaches, and support new collaborations, the workshop included a variety of session formats. Along with a small number of longer papers, all participants presented 5 minute paper (or lightning talk) that responded to the workshop themes. There was also an Open Space session and a World Cafe session on Day Two, where themes emerging from the paper sessions were explored in greater depth.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e12c31d3a4a3.32790906</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.temporalbelongings.org/community-connectivities.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This was a small scoping study project whose primary audience was for fellow researchers.
