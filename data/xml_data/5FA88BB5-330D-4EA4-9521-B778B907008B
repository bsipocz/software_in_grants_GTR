Policy makers and scientists communicate in their own jargon-centric languages, which leads to miscommunications and lack of understanding between the two groups. Consequently, scientific research may not be integrated in to the decision making process, with end users left either unaware of or not clearly understanding how science can support and inform management, adaptation and mitigation options. It is crucial that good scientific research supports the development of policy indicators and setting of environmental targets in order to successfully implement marine policy; the UK government could be held responsible for exceeding or not meeting these legally binding targets. 

This project seeks to promote the use of CPR science, expertise and data to support UK, EU, and international decision-making while identifying new opportunities and policy-relevant applications for SAHFOS data and science. The fellowship will integrate science-policy expertise and CPR data into the UK and EU political processes through the involvement in national and international pelagic expert groups, including leadership of the implementation of the MSFD for pelagic habitats at the UK and OSPAR levels, and membership on key UK and international policy boards. CPR data and research will be transformed to targeted policy-relevant scientific advice for UK, EU and international policy and decision makers, with particular focus on under-disseminated NERC-funded CPR research. New end users of CPR research and data will be identified in order to cultivate new knowledge exchange links and applications. Policy advice gaps and future needs will be assessed in order to steer CPR research towards policy relevance. These steps towards the effective application and development of CPR science will result in better evidence to support marine management and conservation. 

The applicant is experienced in engaging and communicating with UK, EU and international policy and decision makers, and drawing links between CPR research and policy needs and has a wide UK and EU science-policy network. However, her work is repeatedly constrained by funding limitations which have resulted in inefficiencies and boundaries to the effectiveness and reach of policy impact-generating activities. Many opportunities to create policy impact from CPR data are underfunded and revenue-earning contracts and projects are often necessarily prioritised. Although she is currently contributing to MSFD implementation and serving on evidence groups, the work is only partially and inconsistently funded and must be performed as limited resources allow. This KE Fellowship will remove the funding barrier to applying CPR science to policy implementation and facilitate the direct inclusion of CPR research and data into the UK and international policy process. The fellowship will enable the applicant to consistently and efficiently perform policy impact generating work in dedicated working time, and will allow her to better utilise her network of contacts to more effectively exploit CPR science. A key component will be the generation of policy impact for NERC-funded work which has never been disseminated - MSFD application of core contract microbial genetic research and international policy impact of the Global Alliance of CPR Surveys (GACS).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>110269</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Celtic Seas Partnership</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Celtic Seas Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>6D82CA9C-DD99-4214-94F4-C17F2AE0BA38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>England workshop - summary report 18 June 2014 Plymouth University

3. Outcome: Development of close working relationship with UK, European Commission and OSPAR policy makers through leadership roles in the UK and OSPAR level processes; facilitates effective and wide ranging application of CPR science to current policy needs and identification of upcoming opportunities to contribute.
a. Evidence: UK, EU and OSPAR policy makers contact me frequently for advice and I often approach them for input as well; these conversations are both informal and formal.

They are sensitive to changes in their environment and are crucial to the functioning of the marine ecosystem, making them responsive indicators for environmental change. Much of our knowledge of macroecological plankton change in the North Atlantic is the result of the NERC-supported Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey, an ecologically rich and spatially extensive near-surface plankton monitoring program with &amp;gt;80 years of data. CPR research has shown that there have been significant climate-driven changes in the community composition and dynamics of both phyto (plant-like) plankton and zoo (animal-like) plankton in the North Sea and Northeast Atlantic. Phytoplankton biomass has increased, phytoplankton functional group dominance has changed, biogeographical shifts have increased the population of warm-water taxa, changes in plankton biodiversity have been observed, and Arctic sea ice decline has allowed the establishment of a non-indigenous species in the North Atlantic. Ocean acidification is an emerging issue, and the CPR provides a baseline against which to monitor its impact on North Atlantic plankton. In addition to climate change, regional plankton also responds to direct anthropogenic pressures such as nutrient loading, with climate change found to exacerbate the undesirable effects of increased nutrients in the coastal North Sea. Changes in the plankton resonate upward to higher trophic levels, many of which, such as fish, have considerable economic value.

To sustainably manage European seas in a holistic manner, in 2008 the European Commission passed the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) with the goal of managing the marine ecosystem to a healthy and productive state (Good Environmental Status, GES) by 2020. The MSFD applies an 'ecosystem approach' to management, which requires understanding of all aspects of the marine system, and their responses to human pressures as well as to climate change. This is a novel approach to management, particularly at such a large spatial scale as the European Union; the MSFD's execution is therefore a learning process for both scientists and policy makers. Successful implementation of the MSFD requires long-term biological datasets, such as that provided by the CPR, to inform indicators, construct environmental targets and describe a vision for GES. 

Key plankton-relevant aspects of the ecosystem, such as biodiversity, non-indigenous species, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and food webs, must meet environmental targets for GES to be achieved. Interactions between climate change and direct anthropogenic pressures, scientific knowledge gaps in food web dynamics, system-specific responses to pressures, and differing methods of plankton sampling present difficulties in constructing operational indicators. Despite these challenges, effective and easily-communicable plankton indicators are in development for the MSFD implementation for the UK, via Defra, and for the Northeast Atlantic, via the Oslo-Paris Convention (OSPAR). Both the UK and OSPAR have agreed to the development of plankton indicators based on a 'lifeform' approach. This methodology groups plankton taxa into ecologically-relevant lifeform pairs, changes in the relative abundances of which are linked to manageable anthropogenic pressures. NERC-supported CPR data and research have been fundamental in the lifeform indicator development process, and are required throughout the North Atlantic for monitoring towards GES.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I work with policy makers to provide evidence for decision making.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7BEE6658-6048-477F-B05C-804E884E1F79</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54649d43a24031.96201291</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Chairing of UK and OSPAR level Marine Strategy Framework Directive implementation expert groups for pleagic habitats</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>53FC8F85-6ADB-475C-9A82-7A0E6866C5E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.
