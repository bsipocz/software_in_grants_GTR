They pose a serious threat to poultry and are also recognised as a threat to human health. The impact of these viruses can be minimised by efficacious vaccines and diagnostics. The efficacy of these tools is continually compromised by the emergence of antigenic variants due to genetic drift in the HA glycoprotein. Recently we identified that neither recombinant HA nor whole virus antigens belonging to two different H9N2 virus strains had antigenic cross-reactivity using chicken antisera. Consequently, a vaccine based on one strain would be unable to induce cross-protective immune responses to the other strain, despite belonging to same subtype. Similarly, reagents for serological diagnostic analysis also become redundant. Comparison of the sequence of the HA1 polypeptide of each strain revealed that there were at least 10 distinct genetic motifs between them. These finding gave us an opportunity for detailed analysis of each differing amino acid or combination of amino acid motifs that are potentially implicated in the diversity of antigenic specificity and cross-reactivity of these H9N2 viruses. A number of recombinant mutant haemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins and AI viruses will be produced, based on the distinct amino acid variations observed between the two H9N2 viruses. These will be characterised by haemagglutination inhibition (HI), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), virus neutralization (VN) tests, western blot, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The outcomes will be used to establish a direct correlation between substitutions in HA that result in loss of antigenic cross-reactivity or decrease in antigen-antibody binding affinity of variant viruses. This knowledge will contribute to more efficacious vaccines and diagnostic tools to reduce the impact of influenza viruses in animals and humans.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>115669</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Understanding diversity of avian influenza viruses and improvement disease control in poultry and humans</gtr:description><gtr:id>8FE1185C-8B3E-4D00-A1A3-520F7C4AB935</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ultimate aims of this collaboration are to reduce the impact of influenza virus on poultry production and reduce their zoonotic transmission to humans.

will have a tangible impact on capacity building and training of next generation researchers in control of infectious animal and zoonotic
diseases.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project helped my research group to establish research collboration between the Pirbright Institute and the scientists at the collaborating laboratories listed above and an excellent opportunity for building a joint &amp;quot;ONE HEALTH&amp;quot;

The research increase the understanding of antigenicity of H9N2 avian influenza; a form of bird flu which poses risks to both poultry and human health. 

The mapping and analysis of the antigenicity (1) of H9N2 avian influenza virus, will guide surveillance and ensure vaccines are more effective; helping prevent serious outbreaks.
 
H9N2 leads to significant losses in poultry production across Asia, but also has the potential for creating new viruses which can infect humans; with infections reported across China, Bangladesh and Egypt. It can also act as a donor of genes to other zoonotic avian influenza viruses such as the 1997 Hong Kong H5N1 outbreak, and the recent Chinese H7N9 and H10N8 outbreaks. 

The use of vaccines is widespread, but influenza viruses are constantly changing, and so the effectiveness of vaccines and diagnostic tools are often compromised because of the rapid emergence of antigenic variants.

This research will 
. allow to identify the immunological basis for vaccine failure,
? allow development of improved vaccines for the control of influenza infection,
? allow development of improved diagnostics that will able to detect virus variants emerging in the filed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research identified antigenic sites in the haemagglutinin antigen of H9N2 virus these findings will help to match candidate vaccines with circulating field strains when considering the selection of most suitable vaccine seed strain, either veterinary or human pandemic potential as well as surveillance efforts for the emergence of antigenic variants. Our studies also identified antigenic residues that could help to design more effective vaccines inducing broader cross-protective immunity against the antigenically diversified H9N2 viruses circulating in poultry.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EB333341-F65E-49FC-BF96-D37C9F41CC91</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c1e545e29633.04889637</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>1.
