However, it is sometimes difficult to interpret the intended meaning of a written message without hearing prosody (rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech) that is instrumental in understanding the writer's feelings, attitudes, and intentions. For example, a prosody-less &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot; email can be confusing as to whether the sender is being sincere or sarcastic (Kruger et al., 2005). Emails like these are often misinterpreted as being more negative or neutral than intended; such miscommunications can damage social cohesiveness and group identity within organisations and communities, thereby undermining economic performance and societal stability (Byron, 2008).

Interestingly, written words may not be entirely &amp;quot;silent&amp;quot; after all. My recent research showed that we mentally (or covertly) simulate speech prosody (or &amp;quot;inner voices&amp;quot;) during silent reading of written direct quotations (Mary gasped: &amp;quot;This dress is beautiful!&amp;quot;) as if we were hearing someone speaking (Yao et al., 2011, 2012). For example, Yao and colleagues (2011) observed that silent reading of direct quotations elicited higher neural activity in voice-selective areas of the auditory cortex as compared to silent reading of meaning-equivalent indirect speech (Mary gasped that the dress was beautiful.).

Can such covert prosody compensate for the lack of overt speech prosody in written language and thus enhance written communication? To address this question, the proposed project will systematically examine the nature (is covert prosody sound- or action-based in nature?), mechanisms (what information processing systems are engaged?) and emotional consequences (does covert prosody induce emotions and thereby influence behaviour?) of covert prosodic processing in silent reading of written direct quotations.

Theoretically motivated by the working neural models for &amp;quot;overt&amp;quot; emotional prosodic processing in speech (e.g., Schirmer &amp;amp; Kotz, 2006), the current proposal will probe &amp;quot;where&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; in the brain covert prosodic cues of various natures are mentally simulated and integrated into coherent covert prosodic representations and how these representations consequently induce emotional responses and aid in inferring the quoted speaker's mental state. Using complementary neuroimaging techniques, it will localise the neural substrates of systems engaged in covert emotional prosodic processing (fMRI), specify the time courses of the information processes within these systems (EEG, MEG), and integrate this information to form a unified spatio-temporal neural model for covert emotional prosodic processing.

The findings of this project have clear implications for the theoretical development of emotional prosody-based social communication, embodied cognition, and speech pragmatics, and will be of interest to all written language users (e.g., communication-based enterprises, social services, and the wider public). This research also has potential impact on early language education and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). For example, understanding direct quotations requires the reader to take the quoted speaker's perspective and attribute emotions and mental states to them. A quotation-rich teaching method thus may effectively enhance children's Theory of Mind ability (ability to attribute mental states) that is crucial in their cognitive development and social cognition. Moreover, PD patients may struggle in simulating covert emotional prosody due to their motor (articulation) dysfunction. Consequently, they may display difficulty in understanding figurative speech quotations (e.g., they may not detect the sarcasm in - She rolled her eyes, grumbling: &amp;quot;What a sunny day!&amp;quot;). This research could thus motivate the development of a low-cost quotation-based diagnostic tool for monitoring PD progression.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>EARLY LANGUAGE EDUCATORS
Making sense of a direct speech quotation entails taking the quoted speaker's perspective and interpreting their prosody. A quotation-rich teaching method thus may benefit children with poor perspective taking skills (especially deaf children and second language learners who are not explicitly taught to attend to speech prosody). For example, a teacher may direct pupils to analyse the sarcastic prosody of utterance &amp;quot;The weather is lovely today&amp;quot; and guide them to infer the actual meaning it conveys. My current and follow-up research will illuminate the role of covert prosody and perspective taking in the processing of direct quotations. With the help of the ESRC International Centre for Language and Communicative Development (LuCiD) at the University of Manchester, the produced scientific knowledge has the potential for influencing policy makers in designing curriculum and textbooks for early language education.

CLINICAL PRACTITIONERS AND USERS
Understanding the role of the motor (articulation) system in simulating covert prosody has the potential for developing low-cost, flexible paradigms for monitoring the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is a progressive degenerative disorder that begins with motor system malfunctioning, resulting in a range of cognitive and emotional problems that can lead to social isolation of PD patients. Among other chronic degenerative diseases, PD alone costs health services 13.9 billion euros (2010) and the number of patients is expected to double by 2030 (European Parkinson Disease Association). PD progression and treatment outcome are difficult and costly to monitor because it progresses at variable rates and manifests in a range of deficits. A low-cost and flexible (implemented in pen-and-paper, mobile apps, etc.) quotation comprehension paradigm could potentially address this challenge. For example, the severity of PD symptoms may be reflected in patients' difficulty in simulating and detecting covert emotional prosody (e.g., sarcasm) of a written quotation (e.g., She rolled her eyes, grumbling: &amp;quot;What a sunny day!&amp;quot;) due to deterioration in their motor (articulation) system. Once established and validated, it can greatly benefit the current healthcare system where flexibility and individualised profiling are simply not practical.
 My research can also be of interest to clinicians treating auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). AVH affects 50-80% of schizophrenic patients and negatively impacts their lives. Recent development of an &amp;quot;avatar therapy&amp;quot; indicates that building a computer-based avatar (3D face model) to embody the voices in AVH can effectively reduce the frequency and severity of AVH, superior than current pharmaceutical treatments. My work on voice-hearing in direct speech quotations can help develop an economical, text-based avatar therapy to embody voices in AVH.

WRITTEN LANGUAGE USERS
Written communication (e.g., emails, social media, news reports) is a major form of social information exchange across all facets of society (e.g., social services, commercial sector, the wider public). Albeit highly efficient and economical, it can easily be misunderstood due to the lack of speech prosody. Specialist knowledge on covert prosodic processing in written language comprehension can help develop strategies for enhancing communication across different sectors of society. For example, effective use of linguistic cues and quotations can enhance the impact of important public messages regarding health, education and the economy. Understanding the emotional impact of direct quotations also helps identify and prevent biased reporting of two-sided political debates (e.g., Scottish independence, EU membership). Thus, my research will make a timely contribution to the rapidly evolving communication needs of our society with considerable benefits for the economic performance and societal stability of the UK and beyond.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>216622</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Uncovered at European Researcher's Night</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7A934E37-39FD-4371-8FB0-CF977ABDA1F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hundreds of scientists right across Europe took part in Researcher's Night - an event that gets scientists out of the lab and into public spaces to talk about their work. Manchester's own event was the Science Uncovered evening at Manchester Museum, where we set up a stand to quiz people about their experiences with inner speech and talk to them about our research.

Over the course of the night, we spoke to over a hundred visitors who inspired some really interesting conversations. These included a teacher interested in the role of inner speech for children learning to read, a biologist with a seemingly &amp;quot;hollow&amp;quot; but completely healthy brain (due to hydrocephalus - enlarged ventricles in the brain that fill with cerebrospinal fluid), and a lady who can't visualise mental images (a condition called aphantasia), but who could clearly 'hear' the inner voices triggered by our demo. We were certainly inspired by visitors' enthusiasm and ideas, and gained valuable experience in communicating our research to the general public.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c166353a9477.36325107</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.flickr.com/photos/mcrmuseum/29523535233/in/album-72157673591998441/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Spectacular at Manchester Museum, as part of the Manchester Science Festival.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21C100D4-802F-4813-8BAF-0A22EC325372</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Science Spectacular was part of the Manchester Science Festival, organised by The University of Manchester. We participated in this event and held a exhibition stand inside Manchester Museum. We set up posters, information cards, a model brain, and computerised mini-experiments to showcase our research on inner voices to our visitors. Our adult visitors really enjoyed the information and activities. They agreed that different inner voices gave rise to distinct emotional experiences. Teenage visitors seemed to be particularly interested in this topic. Perhaps it is the age when they start to experience inner voices in reading and writing. After learning about inner voices, one teenage boy was inspired and came up a writing method by describing a scene through characters' voices.

However, we also realised that some of our activities were not suitable for younger visitors (~6 years old). Many of them did not recognise the TV characters we used and some of them were not yet able to read. Though kids enjoyed the written stories (read by their parents) nonetheless, we've learned that we needed to adapt our activities for younger visitors.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c169b2c50341.96204962</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://brainsciences.wixsite.com/epiclab/single-post/2016/11/23/Witnessing-the-little-voice-Science-Spectacular</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What Do Psychologists Do? - Widening participation event for local schools in Greater Manchester</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3BC5511F-6362-4670-BB00-6E090B1726AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>300 pupils visited The University of Manchester and experienced what psychologists do in their research and teaching at the university.

Our stand attracted more than 100 participants in our activities. Many of our visitors were very interested in our findings using functional magnetic resonance imaging and shared their experience in hearing &amp;quot;voices&amp;quot; during reading with enthusiasm. Others indicated that they didn't experience &amp;quot;inner voices&amp;quot; when they read, suggesting that there is individual differences in the population. Our visitors reported that our activities were very interesting; they learned that neuroimaging can 'photograph' brain activity and help us study subjective experiences such as inner voices. We, as hosts, also learned what aspects of our activities worked and what aspects didn't.
