spent Fuel vital In a closed loop Nuclear Energy cycle</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J000779/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Nuclear fission is currently internationally recognised as a key low carbon energy source, vital in the fight against global warming, which has stimulated much interest and recent investment. For example, RCUK's energy programme has identified nuclear fission as an essential part of the &amp;quot;trinity&amp;quot; of future fuel options for the UK, alongside renewables and clean coal. However, nuclear energy is controversial, with heartfelt opinion both for and against, and there is a real requirement to make it cleaner and greener. Large international programmes of work are needed to deliver safe, reliable, economic and sustainable nuclear energy on the scale required in both the short and long term, through Gen III+ &amp;amp; Gen IV reactor systems. A pressing worldwide need is the development of specific spent fuel reprocessing technology suitable for these new reactors (as well as for dealing with legacy waste fuel from old reactors). 

The REFINE programme will assemble a multidisciplinary team across five partner universities and NNL, the UK's national nuclear laboratory to address this fuel reprocessing issue. The consortium will carry out a materials research programme to deliver fuel reprocessing by developing materials electrosynthesis through direct oxide reduction and selective electrodissolution and electroplating from molten salt systems. Developing, optimising and controlling these processes will provide methods for, and a fundamental understanding of, how best to reprocess nuclear fuel. This is in addition to the development of techniques for new molten salt systems, new sensing and analysis technologies and the establishment of the kinetics and mechanisms by which molten salt processes occur. This will facilitate rapid process development and optimization, as well as the generation of applications in related areas.

A key output of the programme will be the training and development of the multidisciplinary UK researchers required to make possible clean nuclear energy and generate complementary scientific and technological breakthroughs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Nuclear energy is a vital worldwide low carbon energy source in the fight against global warming. The development of a sustainable nuclear fuel refinement process is therefore essential in closing the nuclear energy cycle, enabling the regeneration of nuclear fuel by the most clean, economic and resource efficient means with minimal waste. Electrochemical molten salt (MS) refinement methods, currently researched worldwide, offer a potential solution, but still with real unsolved materials challenges. REFINE will harness the original, unique and complementary academic expertise in the UK in partnership with NNL, the UK government nuclear laboratory with world-leading expertise and infrastructure in nuclear processing research, to address the challenges of delivering the fundamental measurements and systems research which will enable viable MS reprocessing, the training and personnel essential to establish, deliver and underpin the resultant technologies, and the development of the analytical and monitoring tools to control and interrogate molten salt systems. Within this context, the NNL will provide the expertise and facilities to deliver fundamental research on materials of construction, training, skills development and knowledge dissemination, sharing of knowledge and experience and experimental and protocol development, as well as offering up access to a modern and unique set of inactive and radioactive molten salt facilities. 

This is clearly a multidisciplinary activity, requiring the creation of both a multi- and cross- institutional programme in which there will be shared best practice, partnered systems development, and common application of developed technologies and processes. Each of the partner Universities will greatly benefit from this approach through enhanced international standing, newly forged interdisciplinary links and enhanced prospects for future industrial and academic funding, as well as added value to their share of IP generation. The academic staff and students will gain access to NNL's state-of-the-art nuclear know-how, skills and facilities whilst NNL will gain access to an integrated team of academics focussed on addressing the challenges of molten salt nuclear materials production, as well as access to the major output of highly skilled postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers best able to provide a future, expert workforce in MS and other nuclear processing. The UK will benefit from the timely revitalisation of MS expertise, the creation of novel IP suitable for worldwide exploitation in this area, and the establishment of a UK research programme of real critical mass and international visibility, able to take the lead in future international research programmes. 

The programme will also benefit society through public outreach communication and policy development. Nuclear energy is controversial, with heartfelt opinion both for and against. A major issue is the nature and amount of nuclear waste, especially of the legacy materials from early nuclear reactors. This programme aims to address this issue by developing processes which at least markedly reduce and potentially remove this issue, ideally by using clean electricity as the power source. Such a development would lead to clean (or nearly-clean) nuclear power, which would be expected to have a major impact on public attitudes to nuclear power and on nuclear policy in the UK and worldwide. This is a nuclear good news story to be enthusiastically communicated.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1099514</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Nuclear Laboratory</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>REFINE collaboration partnerships</gtr:description><gtr:id>9E960D02-9CB5-410F-94E0-5834C113EBF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs reported through this submission and submission for individual grants detailed above.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e04b45604152.58426571-5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>EP/J000531/1 University College, London; direct oxide reduction research programme

A series of talks relevant to pyroprocessing (see agenda below), molten salts and molten salt reactors were provided by Chris Rhodes (NNL), Ian Scott (Moltex Energy), Clint Sharrad (University of Manchester) and Ian Farnan (University of Cambridge). The audience comprised industrialists, academics and postgraduate students from all over the UK and the EU; the talks were very well received.

Presentation of REFINE activities and outputs through these routes has resulted in complementary national (PACIFIC, EPSRC UK) and international (SACSESS, EU; GENIORS, EU) research programmes focussed on the development and application of pyroprocessing, involving national laboratories and industrial partners. Indeed NNL now has its own complementary pyroprocessing research programme, focussed on industrial application, as a result of REFINE activities. REFINE outputs (both people and research outputs) have been seen as a key component of UK reprocessing research, which has been recognised by both the EPSRC Independent review of Fisson and Fusion and by NIRAB as world leading. This has resulted in the NIRAB recommendations to UK Government that the work of the REFINE pyrochemical reprocessing research programme be further developed, and the award of the open access DECC Pyroprocessing Research Laboratory to Edinburgh to facilitate the R&amp;amp;D required to demonstrate all the necessary elements of pyrochemical reprocessing at laboratory scale. Invited presentations, symposia and other discussions and awards have resulted in developing connections with significant R&amp;amp;D activities in China, Japan and India. All of the above reflects the impact on UK and international policy, in demonstrating a route to clean closed cycle nuclear reprocessing of next generation fuels, in convincing UK Government and others of the need for this development, and in establishing the critical mass of researchers in the UK to address this.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>327D6724-13D1-44E0-9A0A-3F45B4B1ABE4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e05d91665d63.23474939</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>An electrode, in particular a microelectrode, wherein the surface area (48) of conductor material (44) exposed for use is defined by a covering layer (46) comprising a covalent or an intermediate nitride or mixtures thereof is described.

These have enabled fundamental understanding of the processes occurring in these systems, and, as they have proved to be robust in industrial conditions, the monitoring of the molten salt (pyrochemical) reprocessing of nuclear fuels. A range of different electrode types have also been developed, which have been shown to be able to monitor e.g. fuel relevant species and indicators of system corrosion at process relevant concentrations. This opens their path to commercial impact, through the development of industrially-relevant monitoring for molten salt systems, which have relevance not only to nuclear fuel reprocessing but also to e.g. energy storage systems and electrochemical processing based on molten salts. They have also enabled fundamental understanding of the key steps involved in electrochemical reaction in molten salt systems, including selective electroplating and stripping and electrochemical reaction for selective reprocessing, and the materials knowhow has informed the development of monitoring systems in other corrosive and industrially relevant high temperature environments. The wider REFINE consortium, which Professor Mount leads from Edinburgh, has produced the innovative research outputs and critical mass of training in oxide fuel reduction, sensing and monitoring and selective electrochemical extraction, informed by partnership with NNL, which are required to underpin future UK pyrochemical nuclear fuel reprocessing flowsheet development and implementation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Commercialisation of sensing and monitoring in specific devices, for specific industrial application in extreme conditions sensing and monitoring at elevated temperatures and in corrosive environments.
