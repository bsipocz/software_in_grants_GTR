Current brain imaging techniques do not provide high-resolution images of the tissues. For example, brain scanning techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only achieve a resolution of a few millimeters. Within such an area there may be several thousand cells, each performing a unique task. Although modern light microscopes can achieve the resolution needed to see individual cells they can only visualize objects placed immediately in front of the microscope lens. Recall how frustrating it was in biology class to find the cells on the microscope slide! To create a method capable of imaging deep within the brain, that can also observe what single cells are doing, will require a new optical device. 

The internet boom has not only brought an enormous wealth of information to our fingertips but has driven the telecommunications industry to achieve significant developments in the area of micro-optics. Gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses, in which light is guided as a consequence of the internal variations in optical medium, are now produced cheaply and with sub-millimeter dimensions. Currently the smallest GRIN lenses have the diameter of a human hair, around100 microns. Unlike traditional lenses, GRIN lenses are not ground to shape but generated by doping glass that can then be extruded to the desired diameter. A little like the method used to introduce the letters to seaside rock. Due to their tiny dimensions, GRIN lenses can be used to produce miniature endoscopes. GRIN lens based endoscopes will, like a traditional endoscope be able to achieve access to remote parts of the body, however , a GRIN lens endoscope will be minimally invasive as a consequence of being so small. Thus by combining key characteristics of these devices it will be possible to image individual cells within previously inaccessible parts of the brain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A fundamental challenge for all biomedical research is to validate measurements made in vitro in an in vivo context. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the study of the CNS where the enormous organisational complexity is fully appreciated through experiments in the intact brain. Currently only a fraction of neurobiological research is conducted in this way, largely as a consequence of a lack of research tools. The difficulty lies in identifying methods that are sufficiently non-invasive so as not to destroy the fragile tissue. To this end optical approaches offer perhaps the best opportunity to measure cellular activity whilst minimally disrupting tissue. In this regard multi-photon microscopy has begun to realise some important goals, however, it is apparent that this technology falls short of achieving deep brain imaging in vivo. Consequently, many key brain regions implicated in a variety of neurological disorders remain inaccessible for in vivo study. This proposal will attempt to bridge this gap by developing minimally invasive microendoscope-based imaging methods that will permit real-time imaging of live cells from deep within the intact brain.

Medical endoscopes are designed for the detection of macroscopic abnormalities by collecting scattered light from relatively large areas of tissue. Therefore, even if miniaturised, these devices lack the ability to detect fluorescent signals from single neurones. I propose to develop a microendoscope that utilises novel gradient refractive index lens technology, developed originally for the telecommunications industry, to assemble compound micro-lenses suitable for fluorescence endoscopy. The diameter of micro-lenses can be as little as 125?m and yet they can achieve micron-scale resolution. These qualities of the micro-lenses will permit the endoscope to be inserted directly into intact brain tissue and will afford visual access to fluorescent cells. The completed instrument will combine the micro-lens assemblies with dual focussing optics and two-photon laser illumination.

Minimally invasive deep brain imaging with single cell resolution has the potential to have a profound impact in the fields of developmental biology, neural stem cell biology, the analysis of neural circuit function and brain repair. Through the appropriate refinements, these devices also have the potential to become diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the clinic. As a neuroscientist with a track record in the application of novel optical methods, I believe that I am well placed to develop this technology in a manner that addresses key questions and makes use of ongoing developments in the field of live cell labelling.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>311176</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Dundee</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Physics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Micro-fibre imaging</gtr:description><gtr:id>9D27143F-BE3A-463C-A0D0-8A57AD1F62BA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A new instrument has been produced.
