traits in dairy cattle</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/K002260/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The welfare of dairy cattle continues to gain importance, both nationally and internationally. However, welfare research has tended to focus on indicators of poor welfare such as disease or health status and longevity. More detailed studies of welfare on-farm have tended to be limited, using small numbers of animals or farms and of short duration. Recently, however, farmers are engaging with more detailed levels of on-farm recording, aided by farm management software and encouraged by farm assurance schemes they participate in, which has been shown to be of use in national genetic evaluations and/or benchmarking. Further, recent work by the partners have shown that that routine analysis of milk samples can predict the negative body energy balance in dairy cows, a trait related to metabolic stress and that immune function measures are correlated to health and welfare events such as mastitis, lameness and difficult calvings in dairy cattle. 

This project will draw together the experience of partners to holistically explore animal health and welfare traits in dairy cattle, focussing on animals from the SAC Dairy Research Centre. The research herd is participating in ongoing genetic selection and feed experiments that produce detailed lifetime records for each animal, including production, health and welfare traits. This project will supplement these data with repeated analyses of immune and inflammatory measures in the blood and milk and weekly spectral analysis of milk. Mathematical models will be used to explore the biological relationships between the immune and inflammatory measures and defined health and welfare events in dairy cows. The health and welfare events include lameness, clinical mastitis, metabolic stress, calving difficulty (including Caesarean) and major reproductive illnesses (e.g., abortion, cystic ovaries). We will explore how the immune and inflammatory traits (supplemented by other key production/fitness data such as somatic cell counts) change before, during and after the defined health and welfare events. If successful, this modelling will result in predictive indicators that could lead to practical early warning systems for poor health and welfare traits in dairy cattle that could be implemented in the field to help explore/define new traits that relate to animal welfare.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Using a systems biology approach we will explore the interactions that lead to and/or result in a poor health/welfare event in the dairy cow. 

Assay. This project will routinely (bi-monthly for 2 years including a 6 month period of monthly sampling) assay the blood and milk of dairy cows for immunological parameters (natural antibodies, TNF-alpha, haptoglobin). These data will be collated with the routine collection of detailed data on MIR spectra (weekly) and other production (including product quality), health, welfare and fertility traits at the SAC Dairy Centre. 

Integrate. Individual cow records collected on the farm include daily milk yield, live weight and body condition score, weekly milk fat and protein yield and milk somatic cell count, and thrice weekly feed and dry matter intake. Some of these data are routinely used as an indicator of welfare in farmed livestock (e.g., condition score). Also, these data will be collated in a SQL database to predict the ongoing body energy status of the dairy cow and therefore will be used to define the trajectory to negative body energy status (i.e., cow entering metabolic stress) and/or return to positive/neutral energy status. Health, welfare and fertility traits are also recorded under three main categories: (i) mastitis, (ii) reproductive problems (e.g., cystic ovaries, retained placenta, abortion), and (iii) lameness (e.g., sole ulcer, digital dermatitis, white line disease). Key fertility (e.g., calving interval, numbers of services) and reproductive (e.g., dystocia, stillbirth) parameters are also recorded. 

Analyse. The data will be modelled to explore how temporal variation in the immunological parameters prior to welfare (including health) events could be used as early warnings of the subsequent event. Further, once sufficient samples are available, the milk MIR spectral data will be &amp;quot;trained&amp;quot; (SAC) to develop statistical predictions for the parameters that could be applied in routine milk recording.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The future sustainability of the UK dairy industry relies on farmers being able to respond to key market signals and animal welfare is a key social (and economic) requirement. Key to addressing and responding to these signals is the ability to measure (or estimate), monitor and improve animal and production system attributes as they relate to animal welfare and other drivers (e.g., environment). This project offers a unique and innovative approach to preparing the UK dairy industry to address the challenges it will face to produce dairy products in a sustainable and socially acceptable manner. The partners have successfully worked together to begin to explore some of the key attributes of defining traits that relate to animal health and welfare and how these can be adopted by the industry. For example, SAC has delivered information on, and produced, practical dairy selection tools, particularly the inclusion of fertility, health, welfare and survival traits. These have helped UK dairy producers become more sustainable by adapting to a range of challenges, including consumer concerns; breeding for improved economic performance, animal health and welfare; and reduced environmental impact. Adoption of new indexes have improved animal health and welfare and economic performance compared to continued use of previous selection practices, and has cumulatively reduced greenhouse gas emissions per breeding animal by 1.4% (reduction in CO2 equivalents) per year in dairy systems. The overall annualised economic benefits of the genetic improvement that has taken place in the years 1980-2009 is worth &amp;pound;105.7 million/year to the UK dairy industry. A large proportion (~ 50%) has been realised by including health, fertility and longevity traits in UK dairy breeding goals.

As part of the project the partners will develop key knowledge transfer outputs, accessible to non-specialists. This will include developing display tools for participation in local public science events, includig the Doors Open Days, Knowledge Scotland, Edinburgh Science Festival and Royal Highland Show. These will also be available to policy makers linking to Centres of Expertise in Scotland, in which the partners are involved. Given the inter-disciplinary nature of this project, the impacts of the proposed work will go beyond the direct academic beneficiaries, having positive economic and societal impacts across a range of stakeholders including:
1. Policy makers and dairy industry will be able to use the outcomes from this project to help summarise the manner by which the UK dairy industry are actively working towards improving the social acceptability (and sustainability) of the dairy production chain. Animal welfare is generally viewed as a public good, but will likely be undersupplied by producers for a variety of reasons including the lack of appropriate indicators of welfare status. The results of this project will provide signals for both producers and government (who might need to regulate animal welfare).
2. Animal managers may be able to use outputs from this work to direct early intervention for improved animal welfare as well as exploring the impact of key management interventions such as feeding and breeding. By combining systems of data collection that are already in place to develop predictive models of welfare events this project will allow us to work with the dairy industry to implement such early warning systems. 
3. The public will benefit from this project through having access to data allowing them to assess the cow health/welfare impacts of the dairy products they consume.
4. The UK overall will benefit through the linkages between the research innovation represented in the partners and those delivering knowledge and tools to the industry (e.g., Veterinary Surveillance Services); the outcomes will result in a shorter period from primary research through to on-farm implementation helping UK agriculture reap the benefits of this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>335404</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Aberdeen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The influence of trace element levels on immunity and health in dairy cattle</gtr:description><gtr:id>F132CA81-4B3A-49AC-994D-8F9CDFDE4D2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The data arising from this collaboration are currently being analysed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d953bc89a4f4.93733701-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner has measured 15 trace elements in the supplied serum samples and the results incorporated into the Immune_Dairy database..</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Serum samples collected from dairy cattle with known health, production and immune trait data have been supplied to the research partner for trace element analysis to determine if levels of trace elements are associated with variation in health, production and immune status.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Guelph</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Animal Biosciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Genomes Canada - Efficient Dairy Genome Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>838B5125-822C-4A1D-B483-80793C0A4426</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There are no direct impacts from this work to date.

Already, the Canadian dairy industry generates $16.2 billion to this country's GDP (2011). The current proposal looks to address increasing demand, and the global competitiveness of Canada's dairy cattle industry both on-farm and in exporting Canadian dairy genetics. Canadian industry stands to gain $100M annually by improving two key traits in cattle: 1) feed conversion (feed efficiency) toward increased milk production, and 2) reduced methane emission. This project offers the means for effective selection of advantageous feed efficiency and reduced methane emission traits for a more secure and sustainable supply of competitive Canadian dairy products.
Using genomics-based approaches to define natural variation between animals, cattle will be selected for higher feed efficiency and lower methane emissions. Canadian dairy producers will have access to bulls whose daughters are more efficient at converting feed into milk and have lower greenhouse gas emissions with the same level of production. As feed is currently the largest expense in milk production, improving cow efficiency will substantially benefit industry members financially. More efficient animals also produce less manure waste, further contributing to a decreased environmental footprint for industry.
Presently, it is very difficult and expensive to collect the data (phenotypes) required for genetic improvement of feed efficiency and methane emissions. To date, there has been no large-scale direct selection for these traits in breeding dairy cattle. The latest genomic approaches offer an opportunity to address this, but accurate phenotypes are required for genetically-representative animals from the Canadian population. Therefore, this project focuses on using genomics to collect important data for calculating individuals' genetic merit. Industry breeding strategies can then incorporate these two traits in developing optimal populations, even for young animals without phenotypes. Involvement of international research partners and industry networks ensures standardization of necessary new data, and broad application of project outputs for the benefit of Canada's dairy industry and global food security and sustainability.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>SRUC, has made an in-kind contribution in terms of sharing of data on a) daily feed intake, monthly weights for four yrs in UK and b) Individual animal cost to measure emission in a 24hr assessment with Laser methodology.

Further analysis of immune traits in blood and milk has confirmed their heritability and repeatability. Analyses have also yielded strong phenotypic and genetic correlations between immune traits found in blood and those found in milk. Strong genetic correlations were observed between percent NKp46+ and stillbirth rate (0.61), and lameness episodes and percent CD8+ (-0.51). Results provide evidence that cellular immune-associated traits are heritable and repeatable, and the noticeable variation between animals would permit selection for altered trait values, particularly in the case of the T cell subsets. The associations observed between immune-associated, health, fertility, and production traits suggest that genetic selection for cellular immune-associated traits could provide a useful tool in improving animal health, fitness, and fertility.

Preliminary analysis of immune-asscociated traits and their concurrent milk spectra has yielded positive results. In particular, haptoglobin (Hp) concentration, an important acute phase protein, has been predicted using milk MIR spectra with an accuracy of 81%. Additionally, MIR predictions of monocytes, white blood cells that are largest of all leukocytes and part of innate immune system, are currently 79%.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Heritable immune markers which are associated with increased resistance to disease could be used to select dairy cows which are more disease resistant. This would improve dairy cow welfare, improve the efficiency of milk production, and reduce the use of drugs such as antibiotics in the dairy industry. The development of a simple method to record immune parameters in cattle via infrared absorption represents now means we can record immune function in large numbers of cattle on a repeated basis at minimal cost. Such immune measurements may be used to either select for 'good' immune traits which are associated with improved health, productivity and welfare, or as biomarkers for the early identification of disease. 

This demonstrates that the chosen immune biomarkers are useful for the purposes of genetic dissection of immune response Discussed results with industry stakeholders engaged in genetic improvement.
