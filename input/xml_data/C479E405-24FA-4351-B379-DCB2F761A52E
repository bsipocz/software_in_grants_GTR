J. Jenner's doctoral thesis is ttie first intemationally researched study on the evolution of United States -Vietnam relations from war to nascent strategic partnership.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Comprising archival and oral history research, which included unprecedented access to Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and tiie U.S. National Security Council, his thesis examines Hanoi's and Washington's bilateral diplomacy in relation&lt;br />to ttie Cold War's (1946-91) second half. The study provides an original and archive-based contribution to the historiography on the construction of full diplomatic relations between Washington and Hanoi.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jenner's pluralistic intemational relations studies are founded on a trans-disciplinary research method. The central finding of this doctoral work is that the United States and Vietnam built full diplomatic relations from a complex cluster of seemingly&lt;br />opposing and incompatible parts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There has been no comprehensive historiographical study of United States -Vietnam relations during the two decades following the Second Indochina War (1959-75). Jenner's work provides path-breaking scholarship on Hanoi's overiooked&lt;br />foreign policy-making institutions as well as many of their American and Southeast Asian counterparts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The ESRC Fellowship will enable Jenner to transform this doctoral thesis into a publishable monograph, and organise a conference at the University of Oxford on the United States and Soutiieast Asia, 1945-95.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79069</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>ASEAN London Committee</gtr:department><gtr:description>South-East Asia Forum</gtr:description><gtr:id>14BD90F3-33D4-47E5-9F87-19A1702A2E58</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My collaboration with members of the South-East Asia Forum partly enabled my praised and multiple disciplined academic contribution to the development of Britain's new National Strategy for Maritime Security (NSMS).
