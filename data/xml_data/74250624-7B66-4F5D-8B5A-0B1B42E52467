Programme undertakes an intregrated programme of mapping, testing, monitoring and modelling to describe the physical properties of the UK landmass and how it behaves in a changing climate.

Many geophysical investigations using ERT require electrodes located in boreholes - but borehole deviations cause the positions of the electrodes to be uncertain to varying degrees, and often traditional deviation surveys cannot be used due to the nature of the installations. Furthermore if cross-hole ERT is being used at unstable sites (e.g. landslides, vulnerable earthworks), the borehole deviations and electrode positions can change with time.
