The principle global challenge of our times is how to ensure every child's equal access to inclusive, equitable and quality educational provision regardless of children's differences. In particular, disabled children have long been the most vulnerable group to marginalisation and exclusion in education with far less satisfying learning outcomes. My PhD research explored the current status of disabled children's inclusion in regular schools in China, by listening to what children had to say about their everyday school lives. The research findings show great relevance for developing inclusive practice in Chinese schools. They need to be disseminated to a wide range of stakeholders, in order to overcome inequality and inequity in education in a context where educational gaps become increasingly significant across groups and regions, and where sustainability in development is an urgent issue concerning global interest.

This fellowship will disseminate my PhD research findings and establish an international and collaborative network for inclusive education across disciplines. The findings from my thesis will be translated into 4 key messages: Hearing and acting on disabled children's voices is a sustainable strategy for developing inclusive education; Inclusive education means promoting children's learning, participation, and well-being; Teachers must be supported to develop inclusive pedagogy in classroom teaching; Efforts are required from all stakeholders to transform current thinking, policy and practice of inclusive education in China.

These 4 key messages will be delivered to relevant stakeholders including academics, policy-makers, disability organisations, international agencies, headteachers, classroom teachers, school pupils and wider public audiences through a range of tailored materials and training workshops. Besides the dissemination, it is also important to bring together international expertise in this research field through strong partnerships. Thus I will accept the placement at the Centre for Inclusive Education of Beijing Normal University as a visiting scholar, to build up solid collaboration with leading Chinese scholars in this area. The visit will also involve field trips to local schools to learn more about the needs of children and teachers. I will coordinate the establishment of a world-leading academic network involving key members from Beijing Normal University, University of Edinburgh and Trinity College Dublin. The connection among network members will be strengthened through both online and face-to-face seminars. The network will facilitate the development of future educational development projects. Meanwhile, a network website will be set up to provide accessible public resources. In addition, I will receive further training to improve my academic and transferable skills. Progress and experiences will be shared with relevant audiences in Scotland and the UK. A pilot study will be conducted in one Chinese school to test the model for developing inclusive practice proposed in my PhD research. The fellowship will be undertaken through working with an advisory board formed by experienced researchers from multiple disciplines.

In all, this fellowship will create significant and important impacts on a comprehensive transformation towards inclusive and quality education in China at all levels, from government policy frameworks, structural reform and resource redistribution to educational management, everyday classroom teaching practice and school culture. By working knowledgeably, sensitively and ethically in the context of China, the fellowship will improve educational practices in China based on excellent scholarship, to contribute to the welfare of children and families, and the country's sustainable development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P009670/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1A4C7E39-EE28-48D9-AE87-3E028461DA42</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Elements of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D2DE952A-D3A4-42AA-B3D0-37E979EBA723</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
