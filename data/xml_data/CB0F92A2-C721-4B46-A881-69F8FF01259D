In focusing on women who exploited the social disruptions of modern war, my project demonstrates in provocative and revealing ways the exceptional fluidity of sexuality and gender, and thus highlights the achievements and shortcomings of current historical work that, in the case of gender history, too often overlooks female sexuality or, in the case of lesbian history, too readily claims individuals for whom sexual identity was an alien or unfamiliar process. \n Emerging first from the liberation politics of the 1970s and, later, the Foucauldian analysis of knowledge and power, politically motivated genealogies of lesbian and gay lives have played a crucial role in consolidating identities and communities. However, with the advent of 90s queer theory, identity formations pivoting around a hetero/homo binary appear increasingly unstable, suggesting the need to rethink available pathways in historicizing sexuality. Opening with a sustained critique of a range of practices in lesbian, gay and queer historiographies, the book explores several concepts crucial to identity history-categorization, identity, normativity and deviance-always in relation to specific aspects of the gendered experience of modern war. Capitalizing on the opportunities of widespread gender confusion, some women-such as Elsie Knocker and Mairi Chisholm-used their newfound freedom of movement to become more like men, taking up diverse and unconventional forms of employment, both at home and in proximity to the front lines. Gender historians and historians of lesbianism have sometimes linked such women to the modern category of 'lesbian,' even though these women themselves may not have self-identified as such. The objective of scrutinizing archival traces-diaries, published and unpublished writings, official papers, photograph albums, newspaper cuttings-and clarifying the social and cultural context of these women's lives and work is not to propose an abandonment of identity history, for it is important to continue recognizing its political value. Instead, the aim is to draw attention to its limitations and then determine whether it is necessary to modify it, devise new frameworks or call for intersecting models. With the ebb of identity politics-whether lesbian, gay or queer-we need to better understand how historiographical practices have shaped and conditioned our view of the sexual past, bringing some acts, desires, identities or relations more clearly into focus even as others are obscured or excluded. \n Lesbian, gay and queer history requires greater methodological pliancy, elasticity and even pluralism-a risky venture akin to historian Joan Scott's notion of an 'undetermined history,' with 'no clear map, no plan for what comes next' (2007). A new approach to the history of sexuality less reliant on the tension between normative and deviant, less tethered to modern political identities, promises to yield access to sexualities as yet invisible or even inconceivable. By choosing this rich and compelling era of tremendous social upheaval as a site in which to re-examine the history of sexuality, Disturbing Practices maps the topography of women's experiences of modern war vis-&amp;agrave;-vis their redefined gender roles to displace the 'lesbian' and problematize labels and categories to better grapple with the fluidity of female sexuality. This project points to an exciting new direction in the historiography of women, sexuality, and the First World War through an engagement with the cutting-edge of queer theory. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-06-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34318</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H004149/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6C41006C-514B-4763-BE82-812123897818</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
