We have been filming at CERN throughout 2012, the most exciting year for particle physics in a generation. Our aim is to give the general public a personal sense of who world-class particle physicists are and what they actually do. We have had great access to LHC teams searching for the Higgs, Supersymmetry, and exotics, and to a small anti-hydrogen experiment. We were filming when the Higgs results were coming together, and when a ground-breaking anti-matter paper was accepted for publication. We captured the emotion of these moments in real time. Such moments in physics are rare: they grab the public's attention for a few days, and our aim is to build off that interest and make the public want to know more. We do this with a series of un-intimidating, intelligent, informal short films that open the door onto the thrills and headaches of world-class experimental particle physicists. 

There is a larger message here. In our profit-driven age people expect immediately quantifiable returns on investments. Great minds choose high-risk finance over long-term projects at underfunded research institutions. And so it is vitally important that the public understand the value and excitement of fundamental scientific knowledge. We\ appreciate the pursuit of excellence for its own sake in the Olympics, but when it comes to science everyone asks: what is it good for? Of course many useful things have emerged from the technologies developed en route at places like CERN, not least the world wide web, but in a sense they are side-shows: physicists do what they do because they want to challenge nature, to see how many secrets they can unlock, how much of the universe's unknown they can come to make known in their short lifetimes. The films strive to convey this curiosity and ambition. 

Our focus is primarily on younger physicists, who don't speak to the cameras when big news is announced but stay up all night analysing data, preparing graphs, and tweaking the tools on which big experiments' results depend. We've chosen accessible, charismatic people who viewers will find surprising, entertaining, and inspiring. None of them will win a Nobel prize, even if their work helps others to do so; and they probably won't have the lifestyle of their friends who went into the private sector, where the mathematically gifted can make millions. They have no interest in such rewards. 

Which isn't to say some don't occasionally get discouraged: pursuing exotic particles year after year, for example. with an ever-shrinking likelihood of finding them can be tough, particularly when your friends are celebrating the great Higgs-Boson-like particle discovery. But those on exotic searches explain that even ruling theories out, by finding nothing, helps the community hone in on big unanswered questions. And while the risk of finding nothing is great, the reward, should their searches turn something up, is much greater. These are physics' dreamers.

Informal interviews and quiet observation of physicists at work lead us through such topics, offerring viewers a uniquely personal window onto the extraordinary collaborative skills, individual brilliance, and inordinate patience work at CERN requires. The films are in the end about the practical nature of the pursuit of pure knowledge, and the inspirational people pursuing it. 

CERN People is already a Youtube channel with over 90k views, and a Google+ page with 80k followers. We are applying for funding for our next round of films, and for internet outreach. The project developed out of the documentary feature, MINDS OVER MATTER, which will be broadcast internationally and shown at film festivals, museums, and educational institutions. The web films will build up a community ready to receive and for the feature, which will reach millions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary viewing venues for the films will be the Youtube channel, CERN People, and our CERN People Google+ page. 

We will reach out to universities, schools, teachers organisations, science institutes, and popular science writers and ask them to view, comment on, and link to our films. We will also engage a consultant to broaden our reach by evaluating our existing Youtube viewer statistics and developing an internet strategy around them, as well as to publicise the film both on popular science and physics sites around the web and in places that will reach more general audiences who might not be inclined to read science blogs or seek out science content: independent film sites and general interest online media and blogs that are curious about the nature of the universe and its make-up in a general sense and thus could be lured into watching our films. 

There are things that have worked for us in the past that we will continues. CERN's press and outreach department regularly post links to our films when we release them on our Youtube channel and will continue to do so for the new films. The individual experiments sometimes do so as well, and the physicists in the films share links in their working communities.

The Google office in London is very excited about the CERN People project, and we will maintain close ties with them to ensure that they continue to feature and promote our films to their online communities. 

We have had an initial conversation with science journalists at The Guardian about the possibility of their acting as a &amp;quot;media sponsor&amp;quot;, ie., hosting the films on their site. The Guardian hosted a &amp;quot;hangout&amp;quot; for us in July where the Higgs developments were discussed by a few of our characters, the director Liz Mermin, and Alison Boyle from the Science Museum, moderated by Guardian reporter Ian Sample.

Looking further down the road, we have also been in discussions with the Science Museum about working some of the films, or the feature film they will be siblings to, into their LHC exhibit in 2013.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/K006045/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
