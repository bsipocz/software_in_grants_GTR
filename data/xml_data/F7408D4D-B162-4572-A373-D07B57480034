Being able to allocate staff as required and making the best use of these resources is critical for the longevity of business.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Within this research proposal, the use of historical data, as well as predictive modelling tools, are used to facilitate the best strategy to allocate and position staff based on the prescribed demand for Police Officers. This will require methods of facility location to be extended to deal with real time, variable and static positioning, in a changing and uncertain environment. The modelling tool to be generated will provide an automated mechanism to produce optimal Officer location positioning, with the ability to facilitate stationary and predictive patrol routes to maximise the ability to meet demand in the shortest amount of time, minimising the risk of failure to reach target arrival times and maximising the visibility to the public. This level of sophistication is not currently seen within the force. The potential impact on Crime is immense.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research proposal responds directly to the imperative needs of the industrial collaborator, Leicestershire Constabulary. Given the huge budget cuts that are in place, there is a fundamental need to evaluate current working practices and make changes as appropriate. Without a mechanism to make informed decisions, the end result is potentially incorrect leading to a detrimental effect on incidence demand attendance and service provision to crime and costly, both financially and publically. Though this work is primarily with Leicestershire, this has the potential for all UK Forces to address their Local Police Officer working practices to formulate future policies for operation to maximise effectiveness within resource constraints. In addition there is scope that the methods of the research can be applied to other emergency services, i.e. the ambulance service or fire services.

In addition the algorithms that are to be developed within the proposal will allow optimal positioning of resources (in a changing environment), hence their application can be envisaged for services which exhibit these uncertain circumstances such as large scale events, an example would be the London Marathon where placement of water stations and emergency response is paramount. Also the algorithms would be suitable for application in military applications where positioning of resources for soldiers is key to the success of their missions, or locations of spares and resources for military aircraft on missions abroad. Disaster zones also could benefit from adopting the methods in terms of identifying where to location necessary equipment. There is potential to have huge industrial impact with resulting societal impacts.

This research is borne from the demand set by the public for the requirement of the emergency service provider of the Police force. As the aim of the research is to affect the working practice of Police Officers, minimizing the risk of failing to meet demand, minimizing the time to attend incidents, and hopefully adding to the potential to reduce crime by increasing visibility, there is direct positive impact on society. This ultimately should improve quality of life in these demand situations. For the Police to have the predictive capability coupled with the most optimal response serves to alleviate fears of society as to the role of Police with regards to crime.

The economic benefit of this is the sustainability of the Police force to be able to offer the same or better level of service as they currently provide, under extreme enforced resource constraints. Also the research will serve to set new guidelines and procedural practices for Local Police Officers, one to improve their own working performance and secondly also that of the Force as a whole.

Given the research nature of the project, not only will existing techniques be applied in this novel domain but advances in techniques also developed. These advances will have applications to related industrial disciplines. The aim is to also hopefully enthuse the minds of others to future grow and develop this field of research, where such optimal service level performance can be achieved within tight resource constraints.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252098</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Leicestershire Police</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Predictive Policing Collaboration and extended ongoing collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>EF134AEC-B6C8-4E72-B987-74A03C9D00F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>5 international conference presentations with peer-reviewed papers (one awarded a prize)

The scientific engagement has included: i) 3 journal papers under review; ii) 2 journal papers under preparation; iii) 1 trade journal publication (Police Insight); iv) 5 international conference presentations with peer reviewed papers (one prize); v) 2 international conference presentations, 2 national; vi) 5 poster presentations (industrial and academic, two poster prizes); and v) Future ESRC bid on Orchestrating Custody Configuration in preparation and to be submitted by Dec 2016. The industrial engagement has related to: i) On-going Leicestershire police involvement - mini study to commence October 2016; ii) Discussions/workshops with 3 other police forces regarding predictive policing work (Nottingham, West Midlands and Northampton), and also iii) discussions with the defence industry about wider application of the methods. The Community / Public engagement has involved: i) 5 invited talks - Nottingham ASAP Group, Simulation Research Group and Criminal Justice Special Interest Group (3) on research and broader topics to the wider communities; ii) 1 Operational Research Society (Early Career) advisory meeting (wider postgraduate community); and iii) Press releases and radio interview.

These engagement activities have facilitated the scientific, industrial and public impact. With regards to the Scientific impact there has been several publications in the field showing integration of a variety of OR methods to a new application area, yielding outcomes that are implementable to change current strategy (both within the Police Force and in the wider domain). Industrial impact is in the development of new algorithms to look to reallocate officers, where there is ongoing discussions regarding trials of the methods. This has lead to future involvement in mini analytics projects with collaborators of the ESRC project to aid predictive policing across a variety of Police domains where new research questions have been identified. In relation to the Community/Public impact, a number of wider community engagement activities, hence impact on visualisation of work being undertaken by Police to improve their service. Work has fed into education and research arena as well as community areas.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1269268C-E024-436B-A6AF-AF898060BB85</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54611f13774c01.56325810</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Overall the project has been able to develop algorithms to significantly enhance the ability of incidence response of officers as they operate in dynamic and at times uncertain environments. 

Significant new knowledge and research skills generated and developed are:
i) Algorithms/tools have been developed to enable the mapping of incidence occurrence with officer location to enable the optimal allocation of the nearest most appropriate resource. Uncertainty and environmental factors (i.e. impact on traffic flow resulting from traffic incidents) are factored into the optimisation tool. The algorithms have been validated through discrete event simulation. 
ii) A method of automatically identifying crime hotspots from raw historical data on crime and call information has been developed. This consists of algorithms for data mining for filtering data and kernel density estimation to identify crime intensity. This algorithm is accompanied by a strategy for considering daily changes and other time variants. 
iii) Routing algorithms for patrol routes, to maximise visibility and minimise distance to the predicted response demand, have been developed. This utilised the principle of maximum location problems and was adapted to fit the police positioning problem. 
iv) A Police location strategy has been generated encompassing static and variable positioning for reduced response times for incident demand. 
v) Validation of the officer positioning model is performed through simulation of randomised incident and positioning tasks, with the incorporation of historical data provided by Leicestershire Police. This has validated the process of hotspot mapping and proved the effectiveness of proactively positioning officers on reducing response times. 

New research questions have been identified relating to:
i) The mapping of incidence occurrence and how to better understand the occurrence of incidences to facilitate better predictions of future events.
ii) For crimes that are to be influenced by Police officer presence what factors are necessary to rank the priority of incidents and what is the best strategy to facilitate maximal deterrent capabilities.
iii) The positioning of resources in other Police related disciplines such as Custody, such that deployment of officers to custody units is optimal and also that internal custody suites set up is optimal for the most effective detainee journey and that collectively Custody suites are positioned most optimally for better service provision.

New and extended research networks from the grant have been identified:
i) Extension of the current collaborations have been sought to begin to investigate research question (i).
ii) Engagements with other Forces have communications on-going with regards to future involvement.
iii) Networks across other academic institutions (University of Nottingham and University of Birmingham) have been opened with collaborations through future grant submissions being formed.

In summary these findings have been achieved through the research and engagement activities as well as the co-operation of the collaborator, which is further summarised in the narrative impact section.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The algorithms and results for optimal selection of officers as well as optimal deployment of officers have been shown to the Leicestershire Force (and disseminated more widely). Currently discussions have been made and an implementation plan to trial some of the positioning work is underway. It is anticipated that such a trial will facilitate a longer term strategy of using the predictive capability within the Force.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5ED6E67F-2DC3-438B-8FC8-17E532E365CC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461e732569046.19507703</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The model for positioning has integrated a number of data analysis methods and algorithms -
