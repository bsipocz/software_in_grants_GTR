As trees are everywhere and are well-loved parts of our landscape, an important part of our economy and an essential part of our biodiversity, their loss has serious consequences. However, dealing with each new threat as it comes along is difficult, expensive and potentially futile as threats can evolve so much faster than their tree hosts. Also, tree health is not just about a single pest or disease, but about growing trees in the right place, about keeping population sizes up, about ensuring seedlings get a chance to grow and about allowing forests to change as the environment changes. So, in order to find a sustainable long-term strategy for keeping our trees healthy, we need to consider the range of real and potential threats that trees face and try to deal with these together. At the same time, we need to ask what is possible for changing the way we grow trees: how do we use trees now, what do we want from our trees in the future, and how much change are we willing to accept? By finding a middle ground, that brings together the best biological knowledge with a clear understanding of the possible ways to adapt, we can give our trees the best possible chance of withstanding new threats.

The most important part of finding a way to do this is bringing together many different groups of people, and different types of knowledge. A lot is known about many of our trees already, but usually this knowledge comes from unlinked, independent studies and rarely do results from one study tell us something about another, even for the same tree species. Much better coordination is needed. To show how this can be done, we aim to use the example of Scots pine, an important native tree species. 

For Scots pine, we know of several serious threats that are either here or are likely to reach the UK soon. The remaining native Scots pine forests are small and fragmented, but we know that they are adapted to their local environments: so pine trees from one part of the country grow differently than those from another. There are large plantations of Scots pine in many parts of the UK - there is ten times as much planted as remains in the native forests - and these are often at much higher densities than are found in nature, and often alongside plantations of pines from other parts of the world. There is also a strong cultural attachment to the species; in many places pinewoods are being replanted and it is often used as a garden or amenity tree. 

Our project aims to measure how variable and adaptable are the threats to Scots pine, to test how much variation there is in the tree species in resistance to these threats, and to find ways to get people involved in making healthier pine forests. By doing this we also aim to show how the same thing can be done for any other tree species, and to put in place the tools for getting it done. We will focus on three important threats to Scots pine - Dothistroma needle blight, the pinetree Lappet moth and pine pitch canker. We will bring together a group of scientists - specialists in ecology, tree genetics, forest pathology, plant biochemistry, fungal ecology and evolution and social science - who will work together on the same, carefully chosen pine trees. This work will tell us how much the UK Scots pine population varies and how much it can change from generation to generation; how populations of the threats grow and change; and what can be done to make the pine forests we have more resilient. We will bring in lessons from crop agriculture, where similar problems have been faced for generations, and adapt these for trees and forests, that have much longer lifespans. Finally, by talking to people who work with and use trees, and the general public, we will find ways to use this information to make things change on the ground.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The project will take advantage of existing experimental resources that the consortium has been building for the past few years. These include living experiments (a reciprocal transplant experiment on 3 contrasting sites including 21 native provenances; a glasshouse provenance-progeny trial; field provenance-progeny and provenance trials) and genetic and genomic resources (a large database of mutations across the Scots pine genome and capability for high-throughput genotyping; reference genome for Dothistroma; genetic markers for Dothistroma and pine tree Lappet moth). These existing resources will be made available to the project at no cost. 

We will assess distribution and variation in the threat organisms using surveys and genotyping, and study pathogen evolution by characterising genetic changes in samples from different populations. We will assess variation in the host using population genomics (high-density genotyping of samples from multiple populations in trials) and quantitative genetics (analysis of variation in phenotypic traits and extended phenotype - resistance, phenology, morphology, needle chemistry, needle endophyte community). Data from the biological studies will be unified in a spatially-structured database and used, with data on distribution, density and regeneration rates to model the introduction and spread of threat organisms and their interaction with a variable pine population. The models will be used to test scenarios for management change that emerge from stakeholder interactions.

We will use workshops, semi-structured interviews and focus groups with stakeholders (identified through stakeholder analysis) to identify, test and refine options for building resilient pine populations. This will be a dynamic process, with ongoing interaction between natural and social scientists in the consortium, and with stakeholders. Finally, we will create a template for extending the analysis to other tree species.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>See Main Document.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199274</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Fungal Endophytes</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C1C153C0-397E-4290-8E72-37F7C7EF2BD9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of project results to the UK-wide Forest Pathology Group, aimed at the dissemination of information to inform UK forest health and resilience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac0d7ca97783.26110859</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PROTREE Video</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D4E08F5C-7E02-4920-8295-4F3A8A254E73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of a short film which introduces stakeholders to the project's aims.

PROTREE scientists worked with game designers from a Dundee-based start-up to develop an interactive plant health learning game. 

The game was launched in September 2016 at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow. Post launch the game has been promoted via 14 online networks within the teaching and forestry communities. Articles about the game have been published in Arb Magazine, Confor, Forestry and Timber News, CRANN, The Observer, The Scotsman and The Week. The game was featured on Radio Five Live.

A programme of events to promote the game has now been completed and around 2,000 people have been engaged at seven events across the UK. Alongside the CALEDON game a mobile exhibit was developed for PROTREE and this will be used in conjunction with CALEDON at the Edinburgh (RBGE) and three regional botanic gardens during 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5898769877c4e2.26123190</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.rbge.org.uk/education/schools/resources/caledon</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The tree microbiome as part of the extended phenotype?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DE33D951-0F13-449D-8CC1-3BDB752D716B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academic research talk to present results and discuss concepts at the Centre of Excellence in Fungal Research International Conference at Mae Fah Luang University, Thailand.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac0e666c6af6.46219576</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Fungal Endophyte Community Analysis by NGS - Perspectives on Methodologies</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AA376CE-4D26-4217-8C7A-18292A556F1A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop with talks and sessions to share experiences on the application of NGS data and techniques across disciplines, e.g. fisheries, forestry, agriculture etc.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac0cc22035e0.57070734</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Engagement has included the development of an animated computer game - CALEDON - which combines the scientific results and messaging from the PROTREE project, with a novel interactive learning platform. Players must manage a simulated forest to achieve a series of goals, by developing plantings with different stock types, species and genetic diversity, to generate income and maintain biodiversity, while faced with threats of tree disease (which can be minimsed through good decision-making). Our decision to generate a computer game was in direct response to the UK Animal and Plant Health Strategy (Animal and Plant Health in the UK: Building our science capability) Action 4: 'Generate a plan for developing appropriate plant health skills and career pathways'. It aims to encourage participation from a next generation of plant health scientists. Details are provided in our entries under Engagement Activities; the game has been showcased at Science Festivels across the UK, has featured in youth magazines as well material for forestry practitioners, and has been listed as an activity for schools curricula.

Earlier engagement has also included the development of a project film, made and disseminated in partnership with industry (https://vimeo.com/140911259), and this has been an important vehicle for encouraging discussion about practical management within tree nurseries, aimed at tree disease prevention.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>64C4A89D-A676-4CFF-86D6-186310B4BF75</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d5791d4f30f2.02863502</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The diversity of fungal endophytes which live in Scots pine needles are thought to protect the tree against disease. However, the actual diversity of these organisms was equivocal prior to this project, and there was limited knowldge of endophyte communities. Using Next Generation techniques this study revealed the scale of diversity of endophytes in Scots pine (c. 700 OTUs), to show that endophyte communities have clear biogeographic differences among zones, and within these zones that different tree genotypes have different endophyte communities.

Additionally, a second study has examined the effect of the tree nursery environment on the development of endophyte communities, including the collatoral effect of fungicide spraying to prevent disease on beneficial endophyte diversity. Results from this second study have started to reveal contrasting amplicon patterns among treatments, though further analysis is required to understand fully the potential negative effects of fungicides on natural endophyte communities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results suggest that the forestry industry should consider locally sourced seeds in order to ensure ecological compatibility between the tree genotype and the endophytes which occur in the local environment.

The study is now testing how variability in fungal endophyte diversity, quantified as 'operational taxonomic units' (OTUs), depends on the options for combining DNA extraction protocols and sequencing techniques. A newly developed bioinformatics pipeline* is being used to understand whether endophyte diversity derived from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using 454 pyrosequencing, or using Miseq, varies across complimentary DNA extraction protocols, including CTAB or Qiagen DNeasy. Analysis of this data is enabling identification of the DNA extraction methods to achieve maximum diversity for a consistent representation of community structure. This supports the aim of the PROTREE study, to robustly quantifying hidden players (endophytes) in tree disease resistance, and provides a wider understanding of optimisation of sampling for the massive sequence diversity of unidentified fungi.
