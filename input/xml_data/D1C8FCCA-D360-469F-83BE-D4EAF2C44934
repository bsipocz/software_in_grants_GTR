These changes cross-cut other changes: new roads, new building materials, labour markets, monetisation of the economy - all creating new uncertainties. How, then, to alleviate these issues? As Longhurst, Chambers and Swift (1986) argued, the problematic disconnect between development and policy thinking and what happens 'out there' on the ground is, in part, due to seasonal and weather factors. The monsoon literally obstructs movement. Seasons, particularly with climate change, do not fit the appropriate bureaucratic structures. This means weather-related issues such as unsuitable housing and rain-related landslides are at risk of being ignored. This project looks at uncomfortable and high-emission domestic cement structures alongside rain-related landslides and the effects of these on labour migration. It will make important contributions to reducing emissions from new builds in India and rethinking Himalayan work patterns in the light of monsoon landslides.

The use of cement in the built environment carries a cost of high CO2 emissions (Griffin 1987), and of discomfort in the heat and in cold temperatures, with potential health risks and added energy demands to regulate the indoor climate. At the same time the lure of 'modernity' means cement construction is widespread in South Asia (as it is globally). With this fellowship, I will work towards alleviating the negative effects of this material through working with colleagues in India to raise awareness of the unhelpful qualities of cement and promote other building materials.

Migratory patterns in the Himalayas mean that for many villages family members are elsewhere, earning wages that they feed back into the household economy. These and the goods this money buys as well as government services such as healthcare and education depend on transport into and out of the hills. Changing rainfall, in winter as well as during the monsoon, threaten these systems by causing landslides that block the road. The proposed project will build up the research community in and between India, Nepal and the UK through networking and the Weather Matters online hub. It will build networks beyond academia through linking up people working on climate-change related topics such as landslides and housing at ICIMOD, TERI, JNU and beyond.

The aim of this project is to engage constructively with policymakers on the impact of cement construction on wider welfare, quality of life and economic development in the region and ultimately to reduce the use of cement in construction in India, on the grounds of emissions and discomfort, energy costs and health risk. In addition, I plan to galvanise the conversation about patterns of employment in the Himalayas in the light of climate-change exacerbated landslides that block mountain roads. This should contribute to government policy on the infrastructures that facilitate employment and habitation
