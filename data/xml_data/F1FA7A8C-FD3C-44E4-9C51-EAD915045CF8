The programme of work aims to curate the portfolio of investments in urban research by the ESRC, develop a co-ordinating role in the ESRC call for grants under the urban transformations rubric and to identify future spending priorities in urban research linked to Newton funding and potential cross council research funding opportunities. The work is broken down into seven stages over a period of 18 months from December 2014 to May 2016.

1. Inception. In the first stage of the programme the PI will focus on the identification of work priorities in tandem with the ESRC urban transformation team and senior academic and policy stakeholders.

2. Consultation and gap analysis. In the second stage of the programme the PI will consult with ESRC urban investments to develop the most appropriate avenues for maximising knowledge exchange and research impact related to their work and refine the scoping work that identified profiles for future funding. 

3. Coordination and collaboration. In the third phase of the work programme the PI will commission and develop the knowledge exchange web platform, develop procedures for showcasing the ESRC urban portfolio and agree a communications strategy across the portfolio. This work will complement the PI's role in co-ordinating the ESRC research grants call for the urban transformations portfolio.

4. Narrating the ESRC portfolio. In the fourth phase of the work programme the PI will develop a narrative that describes the urban portfolio of ESRC investments. This will be developed firstly internally with the senior ESRC commissioning team and subsequently as a public document.

5. Knowledge exchange and communication. In the penultimate phase of the work programme the PI will launch the knowledge exchange web platform and develop a programme of blogs, academic synthetic pieces and policy commentaries and debates that maximise the interactive quality of the website.

6. Maximizing impact. In the sixth stage of the work programme the PI will develop a series of five impact workshops with key ESRC investments to promote knowledge exchange and develop good practice in generating research impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work of the urban transformations co-ordinator will benefit academic and policy related audiences. The former will be found mostly but not entirely within the university sector but will be constituted by an audience that crosses disciplinary boundaries and valorises a study of the contemporary metropolis that brings together scholarship from the humanities, natural and social sciences. The latter will involve senior policy stakeholders, a wide web based policy interested audience, interests in public, private and third sector organisations.

Impact will be generated through two avenues of activity over the 18 months of the work programme. Firstly a web based knowledge exchange platform will be designed to optimise interactive engagement from academic and policy related audiences. Secondly a series of five workshops will develop from the results of the 2014 Research Excellence Framework a programme of work that considers the development of research impact case studies, considering lessons that might be gleaned from the 2014 REF and possible opportunities for REF2020.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>713139</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Free University of Brussels</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed off on 15th June 2016 via 2016 Visiting Fellowship by Dr Igor Calzada, MBA, Researcher and Lecturer at the University of Oxford and Strathclyde + Associate Fellow at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Centre for Urban Studies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6FA05294-AC22-468C-8619-941D87E58A34</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

We hope to provide a bridge between the academic community and decision makers, businesses, local governments and communities to support knowledge exchange and cross-sectoral collaboration. Among other activities, our website will compile an expanding selection of British, European and global organizations working in various capacities, such as research, industry and policy, to serve as a platform for partnerships, resource sharing and other opportunities.

A key part of co-ordinating all ESRC urban studies investments, has been to establish a recognisable brand and create an online profile in this area. We wanted the brand to look and feel authoritative, high quality but also cutting edge and dynamic. The website is central within this programme of work and so we commissioned a site that is user friendly, flexible and one that we think is now the main source of authoritative information on urban related material coming out of the ESRC.

Besides signposting events, funding calls and other opportunities, UT also provides an important platform to showcase some of the remarkable studies on cities underway across the world and the real benefits that have been achieved through ESRC-funded research. The online materials include more than 80 project profiles, links to outputs such as publications and guest blogs by project researchers on the impact of their work. In many cases, the Urban Transformations website is the primary platform for the research, generating significant traffic: the Jam and Justice project page, for instance, has received more than 730 unique visits since being set up.
The website currently has:
&amp;middot; Profiles of more than 80 projects that sit with the UT portfolio http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/research/
&amp;middot; 2 commissioned debates that appeal to scholarly and practitioner interest audiences (and of direct relevance to the current and potentially future urban portfolio members). Short comments were also commissioned from the writers of the debates http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/news-debate/key-debates/
&amp;middot; A blog series with contributions from across the portfolio and linked contemporary policy debates http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/news-and-debate/blog/
&amp;middot; A connections area that showcases all the partnerships that have been established through the research. There is an expanding selection of British, European and global organizations working in various capacities, such as research, industry and policy, to serve as a platform for partnerships, resource sharing and other opportunities. We hope this is proving a useful resource for those planning research and those wanting to engage with it http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/connections/
&amp;middot; An events area where we post all events in the urban field -colour coded to show whether they are organised by UT, by a portfolio member or an external organisation http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/events/
&amp;middot; Newsletter sign up facility - http://urbantransformations.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0a4bb45f2706d81aa921acc60&amp;amp;id=6df321bd86
&amp;middot; Associated Twitter (https://twitter.com/UTconnect) and YouTube channels (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNrwgJjykrF qAC1LpeJmdA)
 
Since its launch, we have provided a regular flow of content to the Urban Transformations website, attracting a wide audience and showcasing the work of particular projects. This has included events listings, funding opportunities, news items and other content. This has contributed to a steady growth in users recently, with the number of visits more than trebling between February and November 2016 to over 3,000 a month.

One of the first steps following the launch of the website was the development of a social media strategy and the subsequent creation of a Twitter account, @UTConnect, that since its inception has developed more than 1,600 followers and sent out more than 1,700 tweets. From advertising our own events and outputs to sharing project activities and publications, this has helped enhance the visibility of both the Urban Transformations network and the portfolio's research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6ac96e5c009.33960342</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/UTconnect</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UT Blog series</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D99B424A-78BA-4A58-820D-B3A018F4606F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The UT blog series (currently numbering more than 50) that have been uploaded regularly since the Urban Transformations website went live in 2015. Together they span a wide range of subject areas and geographic regions, mirroring the diversity of the portfolio: mental health, urban energy systems, informal settlement upgrading, smart data, urban governance challenges, food security, mobility, migration and sustainability.

The Urban Transformations portfolio has a wide geographic focus, with three broad levels - the UK, Europe and global - that are also reflected in the different blogs. For example, 'How can planning help the UK meet its development needs? A behavioural economic perspective' (Alex Lord) examined how the UK's planning regime could help drive urban growth, while 'Recognising the &amp;quot;super diverse street&amp;quot; - an interview with Suzanne Hall' (Suzanne Hall) teases out some of the findings of a project looking at the economic and social impacts of migration on urban retail in selected cities across the country.
 
Other pieces have taken a broader look at Europe and beyond to explore regional and global challenges confronting cities. Some recent blogs have been produced following Urban Transformations workshops in Brussels on smart cities, for example: '(Un)plugging data in smart-city regions' (Igor Calzada and Michael Keith) and 'Urban Living Labs, smart cities - and the missing role of culture in their implementation' (Gillian Rose). Urban Transformations has also been cross-posting a new series of blogs by the Centre for Urban Research on Austerity (Jonathan Davies and others) focusing on profiles of different case study cities in Europe and elsewhere. The website also hosted two new pieces by the Jam and Justice project, 'Jam and justice: Co-producing urban governance for social innovation' (Beth Perry) and 'Mapping participatory urban governance' (Bertie Russell), as well as an article showcasing the research on urban rioting in the UK by the Beyond Contagion project, 'Explaining involuntary influence: Beyond contagion' (John Drury). 

The portfolio includes a significant number of projects focusing on key urban development challenges in the Global South. 'Urbanisation in sub-Saharan Africa: Trends and implications for development and urban risk' (David Satterthwaite) outlined the work of the Urban Africa Risk Knowledge (Urban ARK) project on the major threats confronting sub-Saharan towns and cities. 'Developing innovative research in urban food security, through new methods and a new generation of researchers' (Gareth Haysom) described some of the opportunities of experimental research to gain a better sense of food access constraints in African cities. 'Supporting bottom up community upgrading in South Africa - an interview with Maria Christina Georgiadou' (Maria Christina Georgiadou) presented an overview of an ongoing project on people-led informal settlement upgrading. More recent contributions in this area include 'How risk accumulates in African cities - and ways to break the cycle' (David Dodman). 

Elsewhere, 'Living on the land of urban transformation' (Sophie Hadfield-Hill) outlined the research findings of her project on child-friendly urban design in new housing development, while 'Urban transformations in China' (Nick Manning, Cecilia Wong and Ya Ping Wang) described a selection of jointly funded UK-China research projects covering mental health and migration, sustainable development and spatial inequalities within cities. 'Measuring mobility and segregation in metropolitan London and Sao Paolo' (Michael Batty) discusses comparative research on transport and accessibility between two major cities in Brazil and the UK. The website also hosted a series of blogs by the Governing the Future City project (Jenny Robinson) with detailed pieces on the findings so far in China (Zheng Wang) and South Africa (Romain Dittgen), as well as an introductory article on the Public Accountability to Residents in Contractual Urban Redevelopment (PARCOUR) project, 'Introducing the PARCOUR project - an exploration of urban redevelopment in Brazil, the Netherlands and the UK' (David Williams). 

The outward-looking approach of the Urban Transformations projects to challenges worldwide is also demonstrated by a number of the blogs, such as 'A multilateral window for city diplomacy' (Michele Acuto). Ahead of UN-Habitat's major conference, Habitat III, in October 2016, a number of pieces were developed to draw out the principles of the New Urban Agenda (Vanesa Castan Broto's 'Just Sustainabilities and the New Urban Agenda'), the role of the UK within these discussions (Nicholas Simcik-Arese's 'A place for the UK in supporting UN-Habitat's New Urban Agenda - the role of the ESRC's Urban Transformations network') and the prospects of the conference's deliberations in an era of renewed scepticism about 'experts' ('So what difference will the 2016 New Urban Agenda make when the world has had enough of experts?').</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57b6cfd62ad0e2.61750392</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/news-and-debate/blog/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UT @ Habitat 3 for BBC Brasil: Li??es da Mar?: como combater a viol?ncia a partir de um projeto exclusivo para mulheres&quot; - Eliana Sousa Silva, Cathy McIlwaine, Paul Heritage  (4 of 6)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E7CA3CD6-DB3C-4EE1-A7A2-9BAA33BCDA5D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UT researchers Eliana Sousa Silva, Cathy McIlwaine, Paul Heritage authored article for BBC Brasil Li&amp;ccedil;&amp;otilde;es da Mar&amp;eacute;: como combater a viol&amp;ecirc;ncia a partir de um projeto exclusivo para mulheres; Four of six articles for BBC Brasil featuring ESRC researchers on Urban Transformations and the United Nations New Urban Agenda.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5841a35acba350.88081274</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-37519546</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UT @ Habitat 3 for UT Blog: Could cultural heritage topple Brazil's political establishment?  - Andreza De Souza Santos (4 of 4)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B5FE5B50-6438-4119-B3B5-A5C7D1097D3A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UT Core Team member Andreza de Souza Santos authored article for ESRC UT Blog: Could cultural heritage topple Brazil's political establishment?; Fourth of four blog posts for Urban Transformations Website in run up and during Habitat 3 featuring ESRC researchers on Urban Transformations and the United Nations New Urban Agenda.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5841a967b9df30.20658842</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/blog/2016/could-cultural-heritage-topple-brazils-political-establishment/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EU KE Event (13th February 2017): Experimenting With Urban Living Labs (ULLs) Beyond Smart City-Regions</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>04251037-EAC4-44FA-BB1B-F9CA1DBC75F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The one-day workshop commences with a welcoming introduction from Prof. Michael Keith, co-ordinator of the Urban Transformations ESRC portfolio, and Prof. Bas van Heur, co-ordinator of the Brussels Centre for Urban Studies as host institution. It will be followed by six slots and some speakers who are experts in the field: three from the Urban Transformations ESRC portfolio projects and seven from the VUB. The workshop will also include small debate groups led by each section. Each small group will deliver some conclusions at the end of the workshop.
The workshop wants to emphasize an interdisciplinary dialogue, bridge the gap between theory and practice, and encourage knowledge exchange between academics, policymakers, citizens, and activists.

On 13 February 2017, the Urban Transformations programme, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), brought together a range of academics and practitioners from across Europe for a knowledge exchange event on urban living labs and smart cities. This workshop, which took place at the Delegation of the Basque Country to the EU as a member of ERRIN (European Regions Research &amp;amp; Innovation Network), was the second in a series entitled Bridging European Urban Transformations established in partnership with the VUB (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and its Brussels Centre for Urban Studies. In this post-Brexit era, cooperation across borders and disciplines seems more important than ever before. Consequently the series, which runs from November 2016 to October 2017, emphasises the value of connections between institutions and key players in the field of urban transformations in the UK and in the rest of Europe.

At the moment, a report on this event is being produced by Prof Michael Keith and Dr Igor Calzada, MBA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c4cd3fc0f6.89347624</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/event/experimenting-with-urban-living-labs-ulls-beyond-smart-city-regions/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Foresight/UT co-production round table, Sept 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9002EAF4-14A3-4AE4-9AEE-2886F1DFF4D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>this was a policy and academic round table to &amp;quot;launch&amp;quot; the fellowship with key stakeholders beyond the university

Keith, M. &amp;amp; Calzada, I. (2016), European Smart Citizens as Decision Makers Rather Thank Data Providers, Urban Transformations ESRC report on 14th November 2016 Workshop entitled '(Un)Plugging Data in Smart City-Regions'. DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.11175.14240.

On 14 November 2016 the Urban Transformations programme, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), brought together a range of academics and practitioners from across Europe for a knowledge exchange event on smart cities. This workshop, which took place at the Centre for Studies, Media and Telecommunication (SMIT) at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), was the first of a series entitled Bridging European Urban Transformations established in partnership with the VUB and its Brussels Centre for Urban Studies, with support from the RSA Smart City-Regional Governance for Sustainability Research Network. In this post-Brexit era, cooperation across borders and disciplines seems more important than ever before. Consequently the series, which runs from November 2016 to October 2017, emphasises the value of connections between institutions and key players in the field of urban transformations, in the UK and in the rest of Europe.

The workshop, (Un)Plugging Data in Smart City-Regions, focused on the necessity of unpacking and deconstructing the 'smart cities' paradigm that has been so influential in structuring the European policy agenda. The core idea that drove the discussions was the need to define the interconnections between 'hard' and smart' infrastructures and the broader economic, political and social systems at the metropolitan and regional scales. The workshop was broken down into three themes: addressing new sources for data collection, storage and usage; urban expertise for citizen/user involvement; and finally, smart knowledge and expertise to tackle urban inequalities.

According to Gartner, 1.6 billion connected devices will be hooked up to the larger smart city infrastructure worldwide by the end of this year. However, as was highlighted in the discussions, some uncertainties remain at the centre of the debate around what Yuval Noah Harari has described as 'dataism'. The workshop showcased how various projects within the ESRC Urban Transformations portfolio were exploring innovative strategies of data collection, storage and usage to harness urban and regional smart governance models to guide decision-making processes.

Richard Tuffs, the director of the European Regions Research and Innovation Network (ERRIN), a platform that connects academics and practitioners in a wide diverse of research fields within the European regions, introduced the workshop, emphasising the importance of citizen concerns regarding data policies and the role of institutions to foster ecosystems of experimentation via what are known as Triple/Quadruple/Penta Helix approaches, thinking through stakeholder interdependencies engaging not only the public sector, private sector and academia but also civic society, social entrepreneurs and activists.

In the first thematic discussion, addressing new sources of data collection, storage and usage, Peter Triantafillou, from the Urban Big Data Centre in Glasgow, presented the major obstacles to fostering a people-centred design of data that he called the 'human in the loop' - the acquisition, sharability and licensing restrictions of the obtained data. He advocated closer collaboration between computer scientists and social and political researchers in developing stronger evidence-based research on how tackle unexplored data issues so far. Paul Cowie, an Urban Transformations Research Fellow based at Newcastle University and Future Cities Catapult, elaborated on the need to consider individuals not only as citizens deliberating on their material conditions, but also as consumers agreeing and disagreeing to the particular terms of a service. In this respect, there he advocated a more human-centred approach to the smart city - one that fosters interplay and interdependencies among multiple stakeholders.

Citizen interaction, engagement, involvement, participation and deliberation are at the centre of the debates around smart cities and big data. How should we deal with the lack of trust, apathy and open outrage that has become increasingy evident in popular political attitudes today? The misalignments between technology and the social needs of citizens in data generation were identified as a common dilemma today: will data-driven devices continue to serve citizens or vice versa? As a consequence, different forms of engagemssent were discussed. However, as Morozov has argued, despite the plethora of technological solutions to social problems, key questions remained unanswered: 'Who gets to implement data?', for example, and 'what kinds of politics of data do technological solutions smuggle through the back door?'. Discussions highlighted how the calls for data to be 'open', while apparently simple, in reality challenge existing legal norms and pose profound implications for users along the chain. For example, liability risks might be passed to the end user of open data - but what if end users cannot bear the risk? In the internet of things (IoT) generates continuous monitoring and commonly individualised data, how should we theorise, regulate and make visible the ethical choices that have now emerged around the legal liability surrounding the ownership of data?

The second thematic discussion showcased two participatory smart city projects: HackAIR and Flamenco (Flanders Mobile Enacted Citizen Observatories ). The first, HackAIR, is social innovation project and open technology platform for citizen observatories on air quality. The discussion focused on the levels of citizen engagement and related strategies such as crowdsourcing (citizens as sensors), distributed intelligence (citizens as basic interpreters), participatory science (citizens as participants in data collection) and extreme collaborative science (citizens as participants in problem definition and data analysis). The call to transit from the conception of citizens as data providers to citizens as decision makers provoked a powerful debate on the ethical dimensions of participatory innovative technologies. Flamenco developed this theme further, exploring how citizens can be empowered to tailor their own observatories based on participatory sensing and citizen science principles. An inter-disciplinary team presented a demonstration on the applicability of the project from computer science and social science perspectives.

In the final thematic strand of the workshop, the discussions focused on socio-economic developments and institutional capacity. The City of Things, presented by Pieter Ballon from SMIT-VUB, explored the experimental dimensions of data-driven living labs. In the presentation, these were related to multi-stakeholder co-creation processes for business, user design, prototyping and product development (aspects that will be explored at the next workshop on 13 February 2017 in Brussels). To conclude the workshop, Joana Barros from Birbeck, University of London, based within the Urban Transformations project RESOLUTION: REsilient Systems fOr Land Use TransportatION, highlighted the methodological difficulties involved in gathering and comparing data in two distinct metropolitan regions, London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo.

The workshop demonstrated that in one sense what was once novel has become received wisdom. It is now 'common sense' to suggest that the nature of the metropolis demands forms of knowledge that transcend old boundaries between humanities, natural sciences and social sciences. It has become almost self evident to assert that a model of knowledge production that is produced 'upstream' in the academy and then exported 'downstream' to city hall and local governance structures is inadequate for the metropolitan challenges of the 21st century. Instead we have moved towards a stronger sense of co-production between research and practice. The sense that the questions arise in the real world, but the answers are to be found in the academy, is less plausible than ever.

And yet. At worst, at times the 'smart' agenda, particularly in journalistic form and at times in spite of itself, can look like a return through the back door of a technocratic determinism whereby all urban ills are resolved through scientific solutions. Complexity can be analyically generative, simplicity narratively powerful. Such na&amp;iuml;ve arguments are in reality more often the belief of second rate technocrats and third rate academic critique.

More interestingly we see a situation where the complex and open systems of urban life are disrupted by rapid social change and powerful economic forces. Recognising that such change is unpredictable in its disruptive form and uneven in its social consequences, one function of academic research is to speculate, to test, to map and to trace how disruptive technologies restructure the relationship between the individual and the city. The smart citizen at the heart of the new city needs to uncerstand both the emancipatory potential and the divisive consequences of different moments of disruptive innovation. As Ballon suggested in the case of his living lab in Brussels, it is the duty and function of Urban Living Labs to surface and make visible the choices at stake rather than provide singular solutions to problems. How we make these choices then becomes a mediation of scientific expertise and deliberative democracy.

ESRC investments and collaborative links in Brussels at the workshop highlighted how data-driven issues presented new pathways to conduct research and implement policy. However, if we want to unplug data we must consider also deeper the underlying social and ethical questions and policy implications alongside those affecting the technical capacity to store and distribute bits of information and the power of data science. This workshop sparked a provocation as well as an effective knowledge exchange. Dystopian visions and technocratic utopias alike demand rigorous research scrutiny and public debate to optimise the chances of shaping a better future city.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c39f6b4400.16858505</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/event/bridging-european-urban-transformations/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UT @ Habitat 3 for COMPAS Blog: New migrant urbanisms and the United Nations Habitat III conference in Quito</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F69FF434-68C6-4E1E-9C79-7AC3DE5199C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UT Core Team members Michael Keith, Nicholas Simcik-Arese, Andreza de Souza Santos authored article for the Centre on Migration Policy and Society, University of Oxford Blog: New migrant urbanisms and the United Nations Habitat III conference in Quito; A blog posts for COMPAS website in run up and during Habitat 3.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5841a9f867d2f6.30802045</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UT @ Habitat 3 for BBC Brasil: Como ci?ncia e tecnologia podem ajudar a transformar o sistema de saneamento no Brasil - Deljana Iossifova e Ulysses Sengupta   (5 of 6)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A281872-482F-4B6B-A983-F04C6CD8DBE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UT researchers Deljana Iossifova e Ulysses Sengupta authored article for BBC Brasil Como ci&amp;ecirc;ncia e tecnologia podem ajudar a transformar o sistema de saneamento no Brasil; FIve of six articles for BBC Brasil featuring ESRC researchers on Urban Transformations and the United Nations New Urban Agenda.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5841a3c8c8cf61.42185418</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-37641804</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>UK Impact
The UT programme has raised its profile amongst the key stakeholders outside the academy at the Government Office for Science, the Future Cities Catapult, in local government networks, and in new cross research council fora. We believe that this has created a strong body of support for further initiatives that view the city as an interdisciplinary 'space' in which the social sciences can play a leading role. This feeds directly into the work that we have developed through and beyond the Urban Transformations programme to inform the development of the Urban Living Partnership and initiatives described below.
There is evidence that the social media strategy is driving traffic the website and many projects have been using social media in new or more intensive ways. As well as increasing the capacity of urban scholars to engage in social media we provide signposting and connections that did not exist before.

European Impact
The goal of the European workshops in Brussels will be to link British social science research to networks connected to the European policy making community, the Urban Europe initiative and to optimise synergies with the JPI Urban Europe programme. Although too early to judge impact after a single workshop the participation demand is strong. Keith - as PI - has also advised on the forthcoming SUGI call specifications.

International Impact
Our aim was to increase research impact of ESRC-UT coordinated projects and UK scholarship on an international stage. We began the process to achieve this by contributing to Habitat 3, establishing a presence in this arena and making connections between the international projects in the portfolio. For the first time the ESRC developed a profile in this space internationally. We helped to disseminate some of this work by coordinating media coverage and writing articles.
Through this process, we have developed close relationships with editors in numerous publications. We believe that these relationships will allow UT to become the preferred media gateway for ESRC researchers looking to further spread the impact of their work. It is increasingly the case that publishing with major media organizations is a matter of building established trust in the quality and accessibility of authorship with established editors. We have cultivated this carefully, to the benefit of ESRC researchers. We are also currently planning to edit an academic journal on UT ESRC participants research and the implications for operationalizing a New Urban Agenda.
Building on established networks we now aim to maximize academic impacts that can be generated from the synergies across UT. We are in discussion with a major University publisher keen on commissioning a book series with UT and we also intend to develop a series of journal special editions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D27502DA-9F74-45DF-986C-E29E5387866C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e15c1bda9074.38806226</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>ESRC Advice
Three major reports have been produced for the ESRC and the cross council 'Urban Living Partnership' advising on ongoing development and commissioning of future activities. The Urban Living Partnership brought together for the first time all seven research councils and Innovate UK to develop a programme of interdisciplinary work around cities. In each of these reports the aim had been to provide a coherent narrative of ESRC interventions in the 'urban space' and to strengthen the position of British social science (and the ESRC as a research council) in the rapidly expanding interdisciplinary space of cities research.

The first report surveyed ESRC existing research investments, identifies the priorities for future ESRC investments cited in the introduction of this report, maps relevant academic and non-academic stakeholder interests and highlights opportunities for collaboration, emphasising the importance of the emergent international and interdisciplinary fields of urban studies.

The second and third reports were provided for the Urban Living Partnership, where Keith has served on the Academic Advisory Board and also advised the officer team of the partnership. The second report provided a scoping exercise for the Urban Living partners, interviewing representatives from all research councils and Innovate UK to identify the interests of different partners in the field and make a series of both openly published and confidential recommendations on moving the initiative forward. One of the key recommendations of the report was that considerable experience in this interdisciplinary space might be found internationally in Living Labs and City Observatory experiments across the world. 

The third report provided a very basic overview of the experiences in this arena internationally and suggested some key lessons that might be adopted by the Urban Living partnership in the context of the emergent Global Challenges Research Fund.

Securing Synergies
The UT-ESRC session at Habitat III produced clear results that will both inform how research impacts the UN New Urban Agenda, and help to guide avenues for individual ESRC researchers to help bring 2030 urban development goals to fruition. Bringing together local authorities, community leaders and researchers from Brazil, South Africa and the United Kingdom, it addressed how comparative research findings and methods in the planning process can facilitate the implementation and monitoring of the 2030 urban agenda. The dialogue considered how to operationalize city 'expertise', how to research better and intervene with regards to city futures, and how a better-futures-oriented approach compels us to revise how research and policy interplay.

Four themes emerged from the discussion leading up to recommendations:
1) That we need to understand the 'pedigree' of the research expertise that shapes cities.
2) That researchers need a particular expertise to bridge the worlds of city institutions, city managers need the imagination and courage to be challenged by research.
3) That cities have geometries of international networks and internal configurations of knowledge and expertise, as well as other forms of expertise found frequently in the most marginalized or precarious communities.
4) That the horizons of the future are uneven, but that the New Urban Agenda cannot project only into a future of decades. It demands real-time knowledge, short-term achievements and longer-term goals.

Another outcome to highlight refers to the event held in mid-summer 2016, when the ESRC-UT team organised a panel on at the ESRC Methods Festival - featuring speakers Michael Guggenheim (Goldmsiths), Jennifer Robinson (UCL), Patrick Le Gales (Science Politique), and Joe Painter (Durham) - exploring and comparing various research methods for comparative urban research. These presentations will soon feature as one of many ongoing blog and social media debates on urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk.

Another blog debate carefully curated by ESRC-UT's international team and currently online centres on an original major essay by Susan Parnell, Owen Crankshaw, and Michele Acuto titled &amp;quot;2030 Policy Endorsement of a Sustainable Future: Implications for Urban Research&amp;quot; on key critical questions for a global urban strategy.
