species</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/I025328/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The sequence of almost all genes (a draft genome sequence) has been determined for several farmed and companions animals including cattle, pigs, chickens, turkeys, dogs and horses. Draft genome sequences for several other species such as sheep, ducks and salmon will be completed soon. The strings of billions of bases (symbolised as four letters A, C, G, T) that constitute these genome sequences are not immediately useful to biological research scientists. Annotating these draft genome sequences with features such as the coding and regulatory parts of genes, and bases which differ between individuals within a species (genetic variants) greatly enhances the value and utility of the genome sequence. Visualising the genome sequences complete with annotations in an freely accessible manner further improves the value of the information. The web-mounted Ensembl genome browser, databases and associated annotation tools have been shown to be powerful and effective means of annotating the complex genomes of animal species including humans, mice and more recently farmed and companion animals. This project is concerned with improving the quality of genome annotation for farmed and companion animal genomes. International consortia of scientists are using the so-called next generation sequencing technology, not only to sequence the genomes of more economically important species, but also the genomes of multiple individuals for each species of interest and to improve or finish the reference genome sequences for key species. These new sequencing technologies are also being used increasingly in assays, for example, of the extent of gene expression in different cells or under different conditions (transcriptomics) or of the state of the genome (epigenomics). Mapping the sequence read-outs from these assays back to the relevant genome sequence not only provides a genome-wide framework for analysis but also provides further information with which to annotate the genome sequence itself. Thus, there is a recurring need to refresh the genome sequence annotation for important animal species. We will use the Ensembl system to annotate the genome sequences of key farmed and companion animal species. The resulting annotated genome sequences will be made freely available as resources mounted on the World Wide Web. Recently developed features within the Ensembl system enable the analysis and visualisation of genetic variation (i.e. sequence differences) between individuals of the same species. This genetic variation explains the differences in traits such as growth, milk yield and susceptibility to disease. We will populate the Ensembl-animal Variation databases with sequence and genotype data acquired from the animal genetics research community. Visualising these variation data and making them accessible to the scientific community and the animal breeding industry will facilitate research to understand the genetic control of complex traits in animals and genetic improvement of farmed animals. A high quality annotated reference genome sequence is a critical bioinformatics resource for the effective prosecution of contempary research in the biological sciences. The value and utility of such bioinformatics resources are critically dependent upon the currency of the resource. Thus, this project is concerned with delivering high quality up-to-date annotated reference genomes for key farmed and companion animal species to enable research on these economically or socially important animal species.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A high quality annotated reference genome sequence is critical to contempary research in the biological sciences. The Ensembl browser and associated annotation tools and database have been shown to be robust and effective means for making genomic information useful to a wide range of users. Draft reference genome sequences have been established for several farmed animal species (chicken, cattle, pig, horse, turkey) and sequencing is well advanced for several others (including sheep, duck, salmon). Annotated assemblies have already been made available through the Ensembl (chicken, cattle, pig, horse) and Pre-Ensembl (duck, turkey, sheep) genome browsers. However, the utility of a bioinformatics resource are critically dependent upon the currency of the resource. Genome sequence assemblies, including the 'finished' human and mouse sequences are subject to continual revision as new data are acquired and errors corrected. This proposal is concerned with maintaining the currency of Ensembl in respect of farmed and companion animal species, including poultry and farmed fish. Whilst first draft genome sequences have been established for several of the species of interest, improved genome assemblies and increased volumes of ancillary data, including RNAseq and ChIPseq data are also being generated for these species. Thus, we will use these growing and improving data to develop up-to-date and enhanced annotation for these species. Not only are the genomes of more farmed animal species but also the genomes of multiple individuals within a species are being sequenced. The recently developed Ensembl variation resources allow these additional data to be captured and visualised for the benefit of scientists engaged in genetics and genomics, and other lines of, research on the target species. We will work with the animal sciences research community to acquire re-sequence data, SNP and CNV genotypes with which to populate the Ensembl-animal variation databases.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? The primary beneficiaries from this proposed development and maintenance of Ensembl resources for farmed and companion animals will be researchers in academia and industry in the UK and beyond. The access statistics and citations of Ensembl papers provide evidence of the demand for Ensembl resources from the research community. The world's leading animal breeding and aquaculture breeding companies, of which some of the largest are UK companies, have in-house genetics expertise. Thus, these companies have the expertise to exploit the information captured and disseminated through Ensembl resources. Suppliers of species specific 'omics tools such as expression arrays, SNP chips and proteomics system will benefit from access to annotated genomes sequences which include links to features (e.g. probes) on their products. There are potential indirect benefits to the wider public through the addressing of the food security agenda as discussed below. How will they benefit? The proposed enhanced Ensembl resources, especially the genetic variation resources, will enable research to dissect the genetic control of economically important (and complex) traits in farmed animals including feed efficiency and susceptibility to infectious diseases. In companion animals such as dogs these resources will enable the identification of the determinants of inherited diseases. This enabling of genetics research in farmed animals and fish will facilitate advanced genetic improvement for these species. In the past 40+ years, there have been major productivity gains in dairy cattle, pigs and poultry and there have also been significant reductions in the greenhouse gas emissions and global warming potential per tonne of animal product. These gains have been achieved through genetic improvement alone or in combination with better husbandry, nutrition and disease control. Genetic improvement of farmed animal species is a key means of addressing the food security agenda for the animal agriculture and aquaculture sectors. In companion animals the benefits will be improved tools for selective breeding to minimise inherited diseases and inbreeding and to improve animal welfare. The utility of 'omics technology products such as expression microarrays and SNP chips is greatly enhanced when the features on these products can be linked to a well-annotated genome sequence and other information sources. For example, probe sets for Affymetrix arrays and SNPs on Illumina chips can be linked to annotated genes and genome locations respectively, thus enabling more effective use of these products. Academic and other researchers will benefit from the ability to link the read-out from assay by sequence assays to an annotated genome sequence. Without such a frame of reference such assays are of limited value. The impacts on research will be delivered within the timeframe of the proposed project to enhance Ensembl resources for farmed and companion animals and continue thereafter. Maintaining the currency of the genome assemblies and the associated annotation is critical to ensuring that these impacts continue to be effective. The indirect impacts, for example, on the food security agenda and hence the benefits to the agriculture and aquaculture sectors and the wider public will take longer to be felt. However, the time to impact for genetic tests for susceptibility to inherited or infectious diseases in animals with their positive impacts on animal welfare can be short - 1 to 3 years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>318420</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Beltsville Agricultural Research Center</gtr:department><gtr:description>International Swine Genome Sequencing Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>CE7C050B-431D-4B7F-BBDD-C2C619EFE6E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The primary output from this collaborative partnership was the publication of the draft reference genome sequence of the pig (Sus scrofa) in Nature in November 2012.

Coordinated international action to accelerate genome-to-phenome with FAANG, the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes project. Genome Biology 16: 57).
A workshop (GO-FAANG) to launch FAANG and to engage with potential funders was held at the US National Academy of Sciences, Washington DC over 7-8 October 2015.
Funding has been secured to establish a COST Action Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes - European network (FAANG-Europe)) CA1152.
A data sharing agreement has been completed and individuals who sign up as FAANG contributors are expected to comply with the data sharing agreement, including placing experimental data in the public domain in advance of publication.
Further outcomes can be monitored through the FAANG web-site.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c38292056731.69036297-7</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The FAANG initiative is an open international collaborative project. The project partners are developing agreed standards for i) experiments to generate the data required for functional annotation of animal genomes, ii) meta data, iii) data analysis and iv) data sharing.
A few partners have secured funding for pilot data generation efforts and are producing initial data sets.

The genome of an animal comprises the totality of the genetic information for the animal. The initial step in characterising the genome of an animal involves sequencing the DNA molecules in which the genetic information is encoded. The latest sequencing technologies allow the sequence of the four bases (or letters) in DNA to be determined. However, the raw DNA sequence information is not immediately useful to most scientists. The utility of the sequence is greatly enhanced if the genome sequence is annotated. The annotation process typically involves using other sequence data, for example, from other individuals or sequences representing the expressed parts of the genome (i.e. genes) in order to identify genetic variants and gene structures. This grant was used to analyse and annotate the following genome sequences using the Ensembl piplelines: pig (Sus scrofa; assembly Sscrofa10.2); chicken (Gallus gallus; assembly Galgal4), duck (Anas platyrhynchos; BGI_duck_1.0) and sheep (Ovis aries; assembly Oar_v3.1). These analyses have contributed to genome papers for pig (Groenen et al. 2012), duck (Huang et al. 2013) and sheep (Jiang et al. 2014).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This grant has enabled the annotation of genome sequences for several farmed animal species and updating of the annotation as new data have been generated by the research community.
The value of these annotated reference genome sequences to the research community is demonstrated by the access statistics for the Ensembl genome browser for these species, e.g. &amp;gt;50,000 pages views for each of Ensembl-chicken, Ensembl-cow and Ensembl-pig per quarter.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B34100C9-C893-4B24-AD04-F1612DE4E9A5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cde3142d130.53755623</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ensembl.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Ensembl website for chicken Gallus_gallus-4.0 (GCA_000002315.2) released in April 2013 (Ensembl 71). This website comprises full annotation of the chicken reference genome assembly using the Ensembl automatic annotation system. Protein-coding models were generated by aligning vertebrate protein sequences from UniProt to the repeat-masked genome and by using RNA-Seq data for a selection of adult and embryo tissues provided by the Chicken Genome Consortium. The final gene set includes models from both the UniProt alignments and the RNAseq data. It comprises 15508 protein-coding models, 1558 small noncoding RNAs and 42 pseudogenes. 5,139 of the genes were exclusively annotated using the RNA-seq data.
The Ensembl website for chicken includes pairwise genome alignments with human, mouse, zebrafish, anole lizard, Chinese soft-shell turtle, Xenopus tropicalis, duck, flycatcher, turkey, and zebra finch. 

Users can view the indexed BAM files, tissue-specific gene models and the full set of splice junctions (introns) identified by the RNA-Seq pipeline alongside the chicken gene set, chicken cDNAs and chicken ESTs on the Ensembl genome browser http://www.ensembl.org/Gallus_gallus. We also provide gene orthologues, cross-references to external databases, and variations from dbSNP and the Affymetrix Chicken600K genotyping chip. Data can be downloaded from our FTP site or queried using our VEP, REST API, Perl API or BioMart query system.

The annotated reference genome sequences have been delivered through a series of Ensembl releases. The initial annotation work was funded through the BBSRC (grant BB/I025506/1), with future developments and updates funded by further grants from the BBSRC (BB/I025360/2 and BB/M011615/1) within the relevant periods).

Then 120-fold coverage Illumina sequences from both the ewe and the ram were used for a round of gap-filling. At this point, the N50 length of contigs was 18 kb, and the N50 length of the assembled scaffolds was 1.1Mb, achieving a total length of 2.64 Gb and leaving 6.9% gaps. This assembly was the previous Oar v2.0. The current assembly, Oar_v3.1, was created with another round of gap-filling by adding 21-fold coverage of GC content unbiased Illumina sequencing data from the male and 3 Gb MeDIP-seq for high GC content sequence from the female to the original datasets. Approximately 200,000 gaps were filled, including about 5000 that were filled using CHORI-243 BAC library sequences and 454 reads generated for the Oar v1.0 assembly (ACIV000000000, BioProject PRJNA33937). Segmental duplicates were identified by Whole Genome Assembly Comparison (WAGC), and their read coverage checked by GC content adjustment. Probable artificial tandem duplicates were identified using the larger insert 454 and BAC libraries and comparison to the UMD3 bovine genome assembly, and one copy of the tandem pairs was removed. The assembly of 775 overlapping scaffold ends were revised and these adjacent scaffold pairs were linked together. Artificial duplicated copies that had been generated by multiple gap-filling steps using gapcloser were removed, and erroneously assembled scaffolds identified during the error checking were manually split. A high-density RH map with 39,042 SNP markers and Ovine SNP50 genotyping linkage data were used to check scaffold integrity and to anchor scaffolds and super-scaffolds to chromosomes, leaving roughly 5700 unplaced scaffolds.

Of the data cited above, the Illumina sequence data generated from the Texel ram were produced by the ARK-Genomics Centre for Comparative and Functional Genomics, The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh (now part of Edinburgh Genomics).</gtr:description><gtr:id>CCA07B08-C590-45F9-8472-B227C001A333</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The generation, analysis and annotation of this draft sheep reference genome sequence was described in the sheep genome paper (Jiang et al. 2014.

This website comprises full annotation of the sheep reference genome assembly using the Ensembl automatic annotation system. Protein-coding models were generated by aligning vertebrate protein sequences from UniProt to the repeat-masked genome and by using RNA-Seq data provided by the ISGC. The final gene set includes models from both the UniProt alignments and the RNAseq data. It comprises 20921 protein-coding models, 3985 small noncoding RNAs and 291 pseudogenes.
The ISGC RNA-Seq data set includes a range of tissue samples shared between a trio: ram, ewe and their lamb. In total, we aligned 800 GB data from 89 tissue samples to the sheep genome assembly. This RNA-Seq data set is larger than for any other species in Ensembl.
The Ensembl website for sheep also includes pairwise genome alignments with human, cow and pig. Users can view the indexed BAM files, tissue-specific gene models and the full set of splice junctions (introns) identified by the RNA-Seq pipeline alongside the sheep gene set on the Ensembl genome browser http://www.ensembl.org/Ovis_aries. We also provide gene orthologues, cross-references to external databases, and variations from dbSNP and selected genotyping chips. Data can be downloaded from our FTP site or queried using our Perl API or BioMart query system.

The annotated reference genome sequences have been delivered through a series of Ensembl releases. The initial annotation work was funded through the BBSRC (grant BB/I025506/1), with future developments and updates funded by further grants from the BBSRC (BB/I025360/2 and BB/M011615/1) within the relevant periods).

The following updates for sheep have occurred:

Ensembl Release 74 (December 2013)
Sheep: Annotation of the sheep reference genome sequence was made available through the full Ensembl site. Given the large volumes of RNAseq data it was necessary to use a matrix configuration / menu for displaying these data.
