Existing regulations and mitigation measures are based on assumed effects. Lack of information means that the regulations may be either too onerous and recommended mitigation measures may be unnecessary or ineffective. There is a clear need to improve our understanding of how animals perceive and respond to devices and how these responses affect their behaviour, distribution and ultimately fitness.
The RESPONSE project is a multi-disciplinary study focussing on causal links between marine renewable devices (MRD) and changes in the fine-scale distribution and behaviour of marine vertebrates. The overall aim of the project is to identify and quantify actual risk of negative consequences and therefore remove one key layer of uncertainty in the scale of risk to the industry and natural environment. 
The main objectives are to:
1. understand how stakeholders see the risks to the industry and to the environment.
2. measure the fine scale distribution of marine wildlife in high tidal and wave energy sites to understand how seals, cetaceans, birds and 
 large fish use such areas.
3. characterise acoustic, visual and electromagnetic signals that MRDs produce and assess the reactions of marine wildlife to those cues.
4. use the results in habitat preference models to infer zones of influence and avoidance associated with MRDs at both small and large 
 scales.
5. develop effective mitigation methods 

We will achieve these objectives through a set of inter-related sub projects that will:-
1. bring together a UK wide group of regulators, conservation groups and industry to assess the perception of risk to the industry and 
 environment posed by negative interactions with marine wildlife. 
2. use novel, high resolution GPS transmitters for seals and state of the art passive acoustics, active sonar and visual observation techniques 
 for porpoises, seabirds and fish to record details of their habitat use and behaviour in and around operational wave and tidal test sites and 
 an un-developed high energy tide site. These studies will be co-ordinated with FLOWBEC, another NERC/Defra funded project monitoring 
 the physical characteristics of the marine environment at these high energy sites
3. carryout a programme of physical measurements to characterise the outputs of MRDs that have a potential to cause disturbance to marine 
 wildlife. 
4. carry out a series of controlled exposure/behaviour response trials with captive seals and with wild free ranging seals and porpoises. 
5. use visual and acoustic observation data and the operating schedules of existing MRDs to assess the responses of seabirds to MRD 
 operations. 
The results of 1 to 5 will be used to describe the effects of MRDs on individual animals over the short term, i.e. how they react to the stimuli, and over the medium to long term, i.e. how they change their movements and behaviour in response to exposure to the stimuli. These results will be used as direct input to the EBAO project, another NERC/Defra funded project modeling the potential impacts of large scale arrays of MRDs. 
This project will provide a step change in knowledge about the existence and importance of adverse effects of MRDs and provide an ability to predict impacts of</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Please see the main proposal.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>53765</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation - NERC/KTN  Challenges and opportunities of renewable energy conference, Westminster, 20th June 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>430A53AE-F17A-48B4-9D8D-04A697596F13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of NERC RESPONSE and Marine Renewable Knowledge Exchange Programme marine renewable energy environmental risk research at the NERC/KTN Challenges and opportunities in renewable energy conference in Westminster.

Special workshop at the Environmental Interactions of Marine Renewable Energy Technologies International Conference, Stornoway, 2014. 30 international participants spanning industry, government, academia attended, with the workshop identifying key research challenges in the area of environmental risks associated with the development of the marine renewable energy sector.

Although the technological risks associated with deployment of wave and tidal energy devices have attracted significant attention, environmental, social and economic risks potentially contribute an important role in the development of projects. Consequently, it may be beneficial for the industry to share a comprehensive risk register for risks which affect all developers, and address the problems collectively. This workshop encouraged discussion between industry and academic stakeholders, and evaluated the relative importance of these types of risk, based on research and experience from deployment of the first generation of wave and tidal projects. 

The workshop combined both a series of presentations on a range of risk issues facing the MRE industry and a highly interactive session, which stimulated debate and identified the key risk management challenges facing MRE development and future research needs and priorities. We subsequently plan to produce a short report or journal paper based on the findings of the workshop, with the aim of simulating further interest in the risk management challenges associated with the development of MRE.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9baa66e36e9.03657719</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Marine Management Organisation Evidence team</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9DC9E8ED-35F8-481D-BFE6-5216A5F7CAB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of findings from the RESPONSE and NERC Marine Renewable Energy Knowledge Exchange Programme - Review of the current methods and tools to support policy development and decision making in relation to managing environmental risk and uncertainty in the marine renewable energy sector to the evidence and data teams at the Marine Management Organisation.

This was a focused workshop with a selected group of invited participants from UK Research Councils, Industry, European and UK Government Advisors &amp;amp; Regulators, Enterprise and Researchers and is the follow on of the MASTS/ORJIP workshop held in Glasgow, Oct 18, 2016
 
The aim of this second workshop was s 2 fold:
The 1st Aim is entitled Science translation for Industry/Regulators/Funders/Public: How best should the science communities be presenting new information? Active researchers from the VertlBase project (and more) will provide brief overviews of current results as examples of science translation. Facilitated and open discussion will be used to produce agreed methods, and processes to improve science translation between science providers, science funders and science users. In particular, opportunities for practitioners to engage with the VertIBase project were scoped to ensure that the project engages with end users and produces output that meet their needs.

 The 2nd AIM was entitled: Making it Happen: Environmental related research from identification, though funding to translation to industry and policy. There will be updates from Industry, Funders and advances in the process of the development of an ORE environmental R&amp;amp;D strategy for the UK. Facilitated worked examples from multi-disciplinary research identification, to successful funding, through to translation of science will provide the ingredients for open debate across sectors on the best way forward to implement processes that entrench the importance of environmental research into future roadmaps for the marine renewable industry. 

A number of future opportunities for VertIbase to engage with practitioners and regulators were identified as were future research proposals.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd4c39833957.16896849</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>124195</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;
