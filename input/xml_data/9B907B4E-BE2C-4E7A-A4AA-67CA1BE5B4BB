One emerging explanation for this observation is that not all cells within a specific cancer behave in the same way. This partly reflects variability in the types of DNA damage or mutation(s) carried within each cell but might also be related to the type of cell which carries the mutation(s) as only some cancer cells, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), are able to propagate disease relapse in patients. Our ability to understand the biology underlieing this variability is limited as most methods of analysing cancer cells involve pooling large populations of cancer cells, often many millions of cells, and thus the variability within individual cells is lost. This is important as the cancer cell which ultimately cause relapse following treatment may in some cases only account for a small proportion of cancer cells at diagnosis; akin to &amp;quot;finding a needle in a haystack&amp;quot;. One approach that can be used to overcome this is to analyse single cancer cells. Whilst single cell analysis is not a new approach, previous methods have been limited by issues of sensitivity and technical variation making it difficult to understand which of the findings are &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; and which simply reflect &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot; in the testing process. An exciting new technology, introduced to the WIMM by AJM, allows analysis of single cancer cells, thus overcoming the above limitations. This technology will allow both mutation testing and analysis of the expression of genes all from the same cell, thus allowing presence of specific mutations to be correlated with the biology of single cells and also, most importantly, outcome of the patient.

During this fellowship, AJM will develop and apply single cell analysis to a particular form of blood cancer known as myeloproliferative neoplams (MPN). Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a type of MPN which can now be highly effectively treated with a drug called imatinib. Whilst imatinib induces remissions in almost all patients with CML, the disease remains detectable in the large majority of patients due to the presence of imatinib resistant CML-CSCs. As these CML-CSCs are &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; amongst the normal bone marrow stem cells, single cell analysis is required to distinguish CML-CSCs form their normal counterparts in order to understand how these CSCs might be more effectively treated. A similar strategy will be used to investigate high-risk MPN patients receiving novel JAK2 inhibitor treatment, an exciting new treatment for patients with certain types of MPN. Whilst JAK2 inhibitor treatment induces symptomatic improvement in patients, it is also clear that MPN-CSCs are largely unaffected by the treatment and single cell analysis of MPN-CSCs will help to understand the reasons for this. Importantly, whilst these studies are specific to MPNs, as this is the area of clinical medicine in which AJM specialises, the findings of these studies will also be more broadly applicable across cancer biology.

In order to understand how different types of cells respond to the acquisition of specific cancer causing mutations, a complementary approach is required. AJM will develop a number of model systems allowing the selective targeting of combinations of different MPN causing mutations to different types of bone marrow stem cells. It is possible, for example, that the same mutation may behave very differently depending on the cell type which originally acquires the mutation, thus influencing influence the resulting disease type, even though the mutation might remain the same.

Through application of these state of the art cell and molecular biology techniques in humans and model systems, these studies will provide a substantial contribution to the understanding of MPN-CSCs and the findings will highlight the clinical applicability of single cell technology across cancer biology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In haematologic malignancies, and cancers in general, there is increasing appreciation of complex subclonal genetic structures in cancer stem cell populations which may intersect with the differentiation and quiescence state of the cells and dictate variability in self-renewal and chemoresistance. To unravel this complexity requires robust single cell analysis in a high throughput manner. The Fluidigm C1 mircofluidics Platform allows capture of single primary cells and the interrogation of RNA and DNA content by multiplex PCR or through whole transcriptome/genome analysis, all at the single cell level. The technology will be used to define single cell heterogeneity in human and mouse malignant stem and progenitor populations to allow us to better define, purify and therapeuticlaly target these critical populations of cells. Furthermore, the novel mouse models generated as part of the fellowship, allowing specific targeting of different stem cell subsets with oncogenic mutations, is a further major technical advance in the field.

Both these techniques are central to the aspiration to develop stratified medicine in the UK, using state of the art genomic approaches to dissect heterogeneity in patients and to understand this heterogeneity in model systems.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will have a clear beneficial impact well beyond the immediate professional circle carrying out similar research. For example:

1. Economic impact: It is estimated that tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) will cost the health service between &amp;pound;2-3 billion over the coming 10 years. Thus, it is of major economic importance to be able to identify which patients might be able to safely stop TKI treatment. In those patients with TKI resistant CML-SCs, it is important to identify the pathways propagating these cells in order that they might be eradicated allowing therapy discontinuation. This is a key part of the &amp;quot;pathway to cure&amp;quot; developed by Novartis, the pharmaceutical company which manufactures imatinib and nilotinib, two NICE approved TKIs.

2. People: As outlined in the communication plan, AJM has considerable experience of disseminating scientific research findings more broadly with the public including schools and also for inspiring young potential scientists.

3. New processes: Single cell technology is likely to develop rapidly over the coming years. This will potentially have a key role in stratified medicine particularly in cancer biology and this fellowship will place AJM and the MRC at the forefront of these developments. As an example, AJM introduced the Fluidigm BioMark system to the WIMM and HSCB laboratory in 2011. We were the first to use this technology in Europe for low cell number analysis. We are now the reference center for BioMark in Europe and AJM regularly receives requests for information on our experience of using this platform and requests for collaboration, as illustrated by the research outputs listed on AJM's CV. As a direct result of these interactions, a number of other research groups (at least 4) have introduced the Fluidigm BioMark system in their center. The Fluidigm C1 microfluidics Platform allows capture of single primary cells and the interrogation of RNA and DNA ontent by multiplex PCR or through whole transcriptome/genome analysis, all at the single cell level. The technology will be used to define single cell heterogeneity in human and mouse malignant stem and progenitor populations to allow us to better define, purify and therapeutically target these critical populations of cells. It is anticipated that this will generate much more interest even than the BioMark system, with benefits for many other groups interested in working with genomics at the single cell level in the UK and further afield. This fruitful interaction with Fluidigm (the manufacturer of the BioMark and C1-prep systems) has clear and mutual beneficial impact. 

4. New products: The access to serial samples from patients treated on innovate clinical trials, for example the MAJIC study assessing the role of ruxolitinib therapy (made by Novartis) in high-risk patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms will help identify specific patients/groups of patients who are likely to benefit from these new treatments, accelrating introduction of these new treatments with benefits for patients, the health service and industry alike. A number of other pharmaceutical companies have JAK2 inhibitor treatments in development (Sanofi Aventis, Cellular Therapeutics, Gilead) and AJM is already in the process of developing fruitful collaborations with these industry partners which will be further facilitated by the pioneering work outlined in this fellowship proposal.

5. Inward investment: AJM has developed a number of collaborations with industry on related but distinct projects. Industry stakeholders are extremely interested in single cell technology but do not have the skills or expertise to analyse, interpret or apply this emerging new technology. Thus, it is anticipated that a number of collaborations with industry will arise as a result of developing single cell expertise in the WIMM led by AJM</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1544749</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Celgene</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Genetic Landscape in Transfusion Dependent Myelofibrosis</gtr:description><gtr:id>42A11813-4D13-48BD-9BC7-C6B95C614A81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>AJM is a newly established group leader and MRC Senior Clinical Fellow in the WIMM working in the field of myeloid malignancies. The intention for initiating this collaboration is to generate substantial information with regards to the genomic architecture in myelofibrosis that will result in a strong publication. Thus, it would be expected that AJM would &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; the genomic data arising from this research and will have the right to publish these data following an appropriate review period by Celgene.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc3ef224c682.63170157-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Samples are available from 250 patients with high/intermediate risk myelofibrosis enrolled on a phase III trial of pomalidomide (2:1 randomisation pomalidomide:placebo). All samples will be analysed by targeted resequencing using a gene panel developed in our institution (TruSeq? target enrichment kit) followed by sequencing using MiSeq. This assay will require minimum of 1?g gDNA using PicoGreen quantification. The panel will include all the genes listed above. For this project it is important that deep coverage is obtained to gain insights into clonal architecture and evolution in myelofibrosis patients during response to pomalidomide therapy, during prolonged follow-up, and at the point of any disease progression events. Thus, we will aim to achieve 100x coverage for each of the above gene targets. Any patients not carrying any of the above mutations (likely to be a small minority (&amp;lt;5%) will be subject to exome sequencing. 
Using algorithms well established in Oxford by the computational biology research group housed at the WIMM (http://www.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/CBRG_home.shtml) we will carry out state of the art bioinformatics analysis to identify likely somatic driver mutations in this large cohort. Through the interaction with Celgene, these data will be correlated with the robust clinical information collected as part of the trial to understand the relationship between somatic mutations, clinical characteristics and response to pomalidomide. For such a large and well annotated cohort of patients with carefully defined transfusion dependent myelofibrosis, this will also provide unique insights into genetic heterogeneity in this disorder and the relationship to clinical phenotype and disease course. Recurrent, previously undescribed mutations predicted to be functionally relevant will all be validated using sanger sequencing and tracked through serial samples.
Importantly, we are also well placed in the HSCB laboratory to follow-up findings from the sequencing with biological studies to understand how any novel candidate genes/pathways might modulate response to pomalidomide. In addition to state of the art cell culture and molecular platforms, we also have a number of highly relevant mouse models available (JAK2 V617F conditional knock-in, EZH2 conditional knockout) providing powerful platforms for understanding the in vivo consequence of different mutations for development of anaemia and response to pomalidomide. Any candidate genes will initially be studied in cell lines by lentiviral transduction of the relevant mutation or shRNA mediated knockdown if genes are inactivated/deleted to understand if the candidate gene(s) affects the response to pomalidomide in vitro. Once validated in cell lines, candidate genes will be further studied using the above in vivo models, including in vivo treatment of mice with pomalidomide, to understand how different mutations may interact to modulate response to this treatment. Finally, using our extensive cell bank of samples from patients with myelofibrosis, we will then validate possible candidate genes using human myelofibrosis patient samples using either lentiviral transduction as above or by using targeted agents if available, both with and without pomalidomide treatment.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a research collaboration with Celgene. Detail of the original research proposal are below. This research is currently underway and still active.

Myelofibrosis is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with reported mutations in a number of genes primarily affecting signalling pathways, epigenetic regulators and splicing machinery e.g. JAK2, CALR, MPL, TET2, ASXL1, EZH2, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, CBL, IKZF1, U2AF1, CHEK2, TP53, SF3B1, SRSF2 and LNK.1-3 The most frequent reported genetic event is a gain of function recurrent mutation in JAK2 (V617F) causing constitutive activation of the kinase with consequent activation of downstream signalling. Furthermore, many patients show activation of the JAK2 signalling pathway in the absence of the JAK2 mutation, likely caused by mutations indirectly activating the JAK2 pathway e.g. MPL. Recently, somatic mutation of CALR has been reported in MPN patients without the JAK2V617F mutation.4,5 These mutations are mutually exclusive of JAK2V617F and MPL mutations, suggesting that they might activate similar pathways. 
Severe anaemia with RBC-transfusion-dependence is common in patients with advanced MPN-associated myelofibrosis. The above signalling pathway mutations are associated with high as well as low blood counts and rather mutations affecting splicing (SRSF2) and epigenetic regulation (ASXL1) are associated with development of anaemia in myelofibrosis. Pomalidomide, an immune-modulating drug with pleiotrophic bone marrow effects, resulted in improvements in the level of anaemia in several phase 2 studies, however, preliminary results in a phase 3 study are disappointing. Nevertheless, in this phase 3 study, 16% of patients showed an anaemia response (16% also in placebo arm) and 22% a platelet response suggesting that some response does occur in a subgroup of patients. There also were some possible differences in clinical parameters between patients achieving transfusion independence on placebo versus pomalidomide. Together, these findings suggest that a there might be a subgroup of transfusion-dependent or thrombocytopenic patients who would benefit from pomalidomide therapy, although this subgroup is relatively small and lost within the context of heterogeneous patients included in this large phase 3 trial. With the advent of next generation sequencing and personalised medicine it is possible that molecular features might better define a subgroup of patients predicted to respond to pomalidomide.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Oxford SIngle Cell Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>3CCADB6B-A9A0-4E11-BD39-2D9F2F3D0F20</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Oxford Single Cell Consortium was established in 2014 followed by successful application for MRC CRI funding (&amp;pound;5 million) led by Professors Doug Higgs and Kay Davies, I am a coauthor on this grant application.

Limitations in our ability to study the biology of individual cells has historically been a major obstacle, inhibiting our understanding of some fundamental problems in biomedical research such as the onset of cancer, the immunological determination of 'self', and the ability to purify tissue-specific stem cells. Recent developments in the field of single cell genomics is now opening up unprecedented opportunities to uncover individual cell differences within such complex tissues. The objective of the proposed research is to establish a Centre of Single Cell Biology (CSCB) in Oxford that will take advantage of this pioneering technology in order to improve the diagnosis, stratification and treatment of a wide variety of human diseases. The CSCB will be coordinated by the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (WIMM) which has a long-standing technical and strategic expertise in single cell research. The capital development will be used to enhance single-cell research capabilities across the campus in a number of key areas:

Data analysis: Single cell genomics studies generate an enormous amount of data, with consequent challenges for the analysis and correct interpretation of these complex data sets. We propose to establish an entirely new research group devoted to the development of novel approaches for the statistical and computational analysis of single cell biology data and its application to medicine. This group will be located in new space to be developed at the WIMM, but jointly led by leading scientists across the campus. This new initiative will provide a clear pathway to integrate multidisciplinary, scientific and technical innovation in single cell biology research across the Oxford University Campus and to provide ground-breaking applications of this approach to medicine in the UK.

State of the art facilities: We will develop single cell biology research laboratories to allow practical access for research groups conducting these studies across the campus. These facilities will house cutting edge technology platforms and, importantly, will create &amp;quot;ultra clean&amp;quot; environments to carry out single cell experiments. This is necessary as very low levels of background &amp;quot;contamination&amp;quot; make the interpretation of single cell experiments challenging. 

Projects: As a specific example of how this technology will be applied to address fundamental problems in human disease, the lead programme of research in the CSCB will be focused on inherited disorders of red blood cells. These disorders are amongst the most common of all human genetic diseases worldwide with an estimated 300,000 affected babies born each year and a total number of affected UK patients of ~16,000. Currently, severely affected individuals are treated with supportive care, including lifelong blood transfusion and treatment to prevent accumulation of iron in the body, which is costly, burdensome, and gives rise to serious, long-term clinical complications. Here we propose to &amp;quot;genetically repair&amp;quot; the damaged genes in the patient's own blood stem cells. Single cell biology will be central to this project: First, single cell genomic approaches will be used to identify the blood stem cells which are the best target for this therapy. Second, single-cell analysis will be used to assess the safety and efficiency of this approach. This programme, focussed on developing an entirely new approach to treating the haemoglobinopathies, has the potential to transform the treatment of all human genetic diseases that can be cured by stem cell transplantation. This is one example of many projects in development across the campus which will be greatly facilitated by the development of improved single cell research capabilities.

Oxford is in a very strong position to take a world-leading role in the up-and-coming area of Single Cell Biology and application of these technologies to important clinical and basic biology questions across the University and beyond.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Abstract of the grant application:

Details of the research proposal are below:

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a stem-cell driven chronic leukaemia propagated by a population of therapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) that, over time, are capable of causing disease relapse and progression, making this an ideal disease for the study of the cellular and molecular biology of CSCs. Current evidence supports that imatinib does not effectively eradicate CML-CSCs. The high proportion of patients in cytogenetic remission on imatinib therapy allows for ready availability of biological material for the study of these therapy-resistant CML-CSCs. It is perhaps surprising, therefore, that the phenotype and, in particular, the biology of CML-CSCs remains poorly characterized. Whilst second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib have shown considerable efficacy in CML, with a higher frequency of deeper molecular remissions than seen with imatinib, the optimal indication and timing of a change in therapy to second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib also remains unclear. Furthermore, whether patients in complete molecular remission can safely discontinue nilotinib is largely dependent on the presence or absence of residual CML-CSCs. Thus, understanding the response of the CML-CSC population to first or second line nilotinib therapy in pre-clinical studies is a key hurdle to help inform strategies towards the &amp;quot;path to cure&amp;quot; of patients with CML.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public lecture at the Oxford BRC open day</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE761CB7-B3E1-4D89-A598-8A4632441EA0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The BRC regularly holds open days and I gave the lecture focused on Blood diseases.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff4389d8b74.11023877</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Patient forum for chronic myeloid malignancies</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E8061523-B13F-4FBC-BFD6-CE554707A8D1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have established a regular patient forum in Oxford led by our advanced nurse practitioner and involving patients with chronic myeloid malignancies.
