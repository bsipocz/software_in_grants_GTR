The way in which the cell cortex and the plasma membrane interact with each other changes in response to the environment and controls fundamental cellular processes including cell proliferation and motility. Thus, understanding in detail the molecular mechanisms that regulate the cross talk between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane is of considerable importance both in health and disease. We have recently identified the human protein, microtubule interacting and transport domain containing 1 (MITD1), as an important component of the cellular machinery that orchestrates the cytoskeleton and membrane reorganization needed to bring about cytokinetic abscission, the last step of cell division. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that MITD1 is part of a network of proteins that participate in several processes with a similar requirement to coordinate actin dynamics and membrane remodelling events including membrane repair and cell division. The aim of this project is to understand further how MITD1 participates in these processes. The results of this research could provide the foundation for new strategies for targeting cancer cells and rare genetic diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>There are many important aspects about the interplay between the cortical cytoskeleton and plasma membrane that still remain poorly understood. For example, it has become apparent that cytokinetic abscission is a very complex process that relies on coordinated changes in microtubules, actin dynamics and membrane remodelling events but very little is known about how the mechanisms of cross talk between the cytoskeleton and the abscission machinery are organised and regulated. We have previously shown that the ESCRT-interacting protein MITD1 is important for cytokinesis and cortical stability. This project builds on new preliminary data obtained from a proteomic screen of purified MITD1-containing complexes, which shows that MITD1 is part of a network of proteins important for the regulation of both actin and membrane dynamics. We propose a combination of cell biology, biochemistry and cutting edge microscopy to test the hypothesis that MITD1 is a scaffold protein that functions as a hub linking various cellular pathways involved in regulating actin dynamics and ESCRT-dependent membrane remodelling. This hypothesis will be tested by several means. First we will characterise the role of the MITD1 interacting network in cytokinesis, cortical stability maintenance and membrane repair. We will then investigate the functional determinants in MITD1 and interacting proteins by mutagenesis and siRNA rescue analysis and similarly determine the relationship amongst the different network components. Altogether, these studies will lay the foundations for a better understanding of how the interface between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane is coordinated in important biological processes such as membrane repair and cell division.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is mainly a basic research application that aims to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the interplay between the plasma membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton in several dynamic processes including membrane repair, cell division, adhesion, and migration. Thus, the project will benefit members of the wider academic community. The primary mechanism for communication of this research will be through open access publication in peer review international journals. The postdoctoral researcher funded by this work will develop crucial new skills that will allow him/her to contribute to the scientific economy of the United Kingdom after the completion of the project.
Beyond the impact in the academic environment, the work proposed may have important implications for public health and welfare in the long-term as it will help us understand fundamental aspects of cell function and their links to human disease and, although will not yield immediate practical benefits, will set up the basis for future translation of research into patients. For example, cytokinesis, the last step in cell division, involves dramatic cell shape changes governed by the actin cytoskeleton that need to be coordinated with extensive remodelling of the plasma membrane to ensure the separation of the two new daughter cells. Cytokinesis failure can have catastrophic consequences for the organism, as it results in genetically unstable tetraploid cells, which are more prone to neoplastic transformation and may drastically accelerate the development of aggressive tumour phenotypes. Thus, a better understanding of the processes involved in cytokinesis and how cytokinesis defects may be related to cancer development might be exploited for early detection of cancers, which in turn would improve the therapeutic endpoints. Similarly, the interaction between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for controlling the cell's response to the environment and regulates cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. Consequently, anomalies in the processes bridging membrane remodelling and cytoskeleton dynamics result in many pathologies including invadopodia formation and cancer metastasis or rare human diseases that are caused by genetic mutations, like Lowe syndrome and faciogenital dysplasia. Understanding the mechanisms governing these processes may ultimately help in the development of new drugs for the treatment of these congenital diseases.
Finally, the general public will also benefit from this project. Our microscopy work will produce powerful images that can serve as a starting point for public engagement with science. We will seek to communicate our work to lay audiences through different events regularly organized by King's College London including talks, websites, and general audience publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>362851</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NSAMR taster month</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DD53CA66-CCD6-415D-8B7D-C870DF406808</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Taster sessions organised by the National Student Association of Medical Research (NSAMR) where 2 medical students in Year 1 and Year 2 with no previous experience in research visited my laboratory and shadowed my post-doc for two evenings to get early exposure to research. Additionally, a half-day workshop for all interested medical students across London taking part in the NSAMR taster scheme was organised. This event was live-streamed but we had a few technical glitches that we're hoping to fix for next year's event.
Altogether, these activities allowed students to listen to first-hand experiences and find out about clinical academic careers, the types of clinical research programmes available and how to get involved with research in our institution or elsewhere, breaking down the barrier of access to researchers and knowledge of opportunities for medicine students.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c18d9c31c334.69030895</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.nsamr.org/research/taster-month/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N000501/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D22AE401-1C35-4706-A19C-10861ABC82CD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological membranes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D3FE6EA5-4508-4525-8DA5-4D78DF7F3BAC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell cycle</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1163A5D2-CE35-4C7E-904E-6FB2B5FA0C2A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Multiprotein complexes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DA052B9-38AC-4F23-88FA-66C8DEB08B81</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organelles &amp; components</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F14C04A0-571D-4298-AEAC-AEC5A0A9DB7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Structural Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
