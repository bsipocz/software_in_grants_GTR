Four participatory case-studies of four very different types of social movement, in Colombia, Nepal, Turkey and South Africa will be explored through a process of participatory, collaborative research that is carried out in close collaboration with the respective social movements. The case studies will then be synthesized to draw out comparative insights on the learning and knowledge production strategies of social movements in contexts of conflict. 
Recent research on 'peacebuilding' has noted the lack of participation of civil society in peacebuilding processes, which results in peace agreements and peacebuilding processes that while ending the armed conflict, often fail to remedy the underlying factors that produced the conflict in the first place. At the heart of the drivers of conflict in many contexts is inequality, in its multiple economic, political, cultural dimensions: unequal access to resources, land, food, housing, education, healthcare, and unequal treatment before the law and/or the political system, particularly for different cultural and ethnic communities. These are precisely the areas that many grassroots social movements seek to mobilise in favour of. Strengthening social movements seeking to pressurise states to redress inequalities, is therefore a crucial peacebuilding measure and an important area of research that has hitherto received very little attention.

The social movements, who are core partners in the proposed research, are NOMADESC, a grassroots NGO based in Colombia; The Housing Assembly, a grassroots movement from South Africa; The HDK (Peoples' Democratic Congress), a coalition of social movements in Turkey; and the Madhesh Foundation, Nepal, an organisation that works with and for the excluded Madhesh community. Each movement, in different ways, advocates with and for marginalized communities seeking to defend and extend their basic rights to education, health, housing, life, dignity and equal treatment before the law. Each movement, to different degrees, has also been victim to state repression, violence against it members and activists, and sustained surveillance and persecution.

By focusing on the four social movements in diverse political and cultural contexts, we will develop an understanding of the multitude of ways social movements sustain and influence the agenda of social justice in conflict-affected contexts. Within each movement, we will analyse the processes of self-organisation (Fuchs, 2006), carry out 'movement mapping' to identify movement dynamics (e.g. organisations, memberships, ecological interconnections, patterns of mobilisation and stages), strategies (e.g. agenda setting, network ties, communication, movement plan of action) and actions (e.g. demonstration, strikes, boycotts, negotiations, parallel institutional structures). We will pay particular attention to how they cope with security challenges, how they engage in international solidarity and how they communicate with each other and raise awareness through different technological and pedagogical devices. 
The research will make an important contribution to research on social movements, research on peacebuilding and research on education in social movements. Furthermore, the research will have real value for the four social movements under investigation, allowing for a period of self reflection and strategic development. It will also feed into real world debates on the struggles, strategies and knowledge production processes of social movements around the world in a period where increasing inequality, conflict and rising authoritarianism necessitate the strengthening of progressive social movements to build more sustainable and socially just societies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will primarily impact on social movements and their activists, from our four social movements in Colombia, Nepal, South Africa and Nepal. It will also impact on social movements and activists more generally in the four case study countries and activists and movements in the UK. The research will also impact on academics and researchers in the five countries including the UK, and international and national policy makers in conflict-affect contexts, as well as international agencies engaged in peacebuilding processes. Finally, the research will impact civil society organisations supporting social justice movements and a wider community of individuals and organisations that are committed to peace with social justice around the world. 

Through a systematic investigation and theorisation of learning and strategy development that occurs within social movements in the four countries, the research will provide an intellectual recognition to the processes, methods and strategies of social movements. Our objective is to begin from the social movements under investigation, and ripple out to national social movements in the respective countries, critical academic/activists in each of the countries under investigation, UK social movements and activists, global communities of critical academics and social movements committed to promoting peace with social justice and also to international institutions engaged in peacebuilding processes. 

From the initial framing of this project, we have begun to develop and operationalize an impact strategy. The development of the proposal was initiated through a 3-day visit by leaders of the 4 respective movements to the University of Sussex in October 2016, and we combined a 2-day closed meeting with a one-day public meeting, attended by over 150 students, academics and activists. This event also resulted in a Special Issue of the UK current affairs magazine RED PEPPER (No.212, March 2017), which outlines the four different movements, and explores the focus of the research.

Social Movement Impact: In each social movement under study, the process of research co-production, critical reflection and mass engagement will provide the catalyst for a serious of national retrospective and prospective process of reflection that is likely to have real impact on knowledge and strategy development in the respective movements. Our partner organisations will benefit from research capacity building, methodological training on documenting and systematising movement techniques, approaches, methods and strategies which will provide an intellectual impetus to their movements.
 
Intra and inter-movement solidarity: Through our 5 workshops that will take place over the two years, one in each country context, including the UK, we have a two-fold impact objective. The first objective is to build inter-country, inter-movement understanding and dialogue, to enhance the respective movements' repertoire and understanding of learning and strategy development in conflict contexts.

Strategic collaboration for international solidarity for social movements: The research will establish a strategic partnership between the four movements and our UK partner War on Want, to promote collaborative learning, research and knowledge exchange in the future. This will promote cross-movement learning about activism: persistence strategies; critique of intra-movement crisis (e.g. corruption, abuse of power, immoral character etc.); resilience to cope with oppression while keeping struggle alive; risks of co-option, factionalism and conversion into violence.

International Peacebuilding Community: research will inform international peacebuilding institutions of potential role of social movements in peacebuilding processes. This will be done through timely dissemination of outputs in multiple forms: full reports, policy briefs, blogs and multi-media outputs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>491618</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R00403X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A05AA82B-96A8-4834-97FE-23963DE22DB5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Phases of education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
