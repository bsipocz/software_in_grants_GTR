Since its rebuilding in the 1830s and 1840s, it has held a special place in the visualisation of UK imagery. This was achieved by the multiplicity of national emblemata designed by Pugin and other designers and the selection of subjects and historic figures in the commissioned paintings and sculpture together with the agreed incorporation of national symbolism into the grand design of the Palace. This project will examine a half century and more of how the PoW has contributed to the now much debated history of national visual representation. By focussing on the second half of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century, the project will discuss the tensions and difficulties that artists, public officials and arbiters of taste had to endure so as to make such visual representation accessible in an expanding democracy as well as in an increasingly egalitarian era. The archives of the PoW and the related archives of various institutions, at for example, the British Library (BL), the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;amp;A) and the National Archives (NA) suggest that a thorough study of the arguments and debates about what a national parliament meant in the second half of the nineteenth century will reveal much more about the development of the PoW than a mere list of artefacts. Issues about access; the display of English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh imagery in a parliamentary setting; debates about the display of a fuller history of the nations of these islands. All of these issues concerned the various individuals who worked in the PoW during the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe aim of the project is to produce an historical and analytical study of how the rebuilt Palace responded to the representation of the union of the nations given that in the nineteenth century that union consisted of the whole of Great Britain and Ireland. This research project intends to offer insight into the representation of all the nations using both the building itself, its architectural features, the permanent murals and mosaics that decorate its walls, for example, Daniel Maclise's paintings for the Royal Gallery (1859-61), Edward Poynter's and later Robert Anning Bell's mosaics of the four nations executed between 1860s and the 1920s as well as portable art works commissioned or purchased over a long period of time. This project will address the role of visual material at Westminster created from the deliberations of the Fine Arts Commission in the 1840s up to the establishment of the Irish Free State (1921).\n\nThe primary sources will be archival material in the PoW and the numerous parliamentary reports dealing with the new PoW. Parliamentary debates will also be an important source (Hansard). These sources will be supplemented by research into publicly available papers relating to various artists, members of the Fine Arts Commission and other parliamentary committees, as well as a host of parliamentarians and art advisers. Such papers will be consulted at the BL, the NA, London, the V&amp;amp;A, National Library of Ireland (NLI, Dublin), and the National Library of Scotland (NLS, Edinburgh). Architectural drawings and papers relating to Pugin's designs will also be consulted (Royal Institute of British Architects and the V&amp;amp;A, both in London). The PoW is committed to widening the scope of its collaborations with HEIs and to enhancing its research profile. The objectives are to consider the cultural and art historical controversies surrounding Britain's seat of parliament in the second half of the nineteenth century and up to the 1920s. \n\nThe state's attitude to national imagery in the UK has been an important part of civic life since, at least, the early nineteenth century. This is as strong an issue today as it was in the second h</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The PoW is keen to widen the scope of collaboration beyond its well-established curatorial and technical networks to include a new programme of focussed research into the history of the collection and the institution itself. The project intends to foster a larger interdisciplinary and collaborative research programme on the art historical and cultural history of parliament in nineteenth and early twentieth-century Britain. This is an exciting project both for the University of Nottingham and the PoW as the outputs will remain a key resource for expertise and comment in any further studies. \n\nThe aim is to increase awareness of the visualisation of the various nations that make up the UK and the need for greater sensitivity in cultural and historical discussions. By drawing attention to the rich material culture that exists in the PoW, we will communicate results of this research through exhibitions, the parliamentary website, lectures and tours of the PoW. A further important outcome is informing national legislators of the material objects within the PoW. Beneficiaries of this research will thus include staff at the PoW, parliamentarians, the general public who physically tour the building and visit the website, and academics who consult the Curator's Office and the archive. Apart from national legislators, the research will inform policy makers in the four home nations and potentially other international parliaments.\n\nThe delivery of this research will benefit policy makers by enlarging understanding of the role of cultural symbols in public institutions. By attending to the meaning of symbols, policy makers will increase their awareness of the diverse nature of the UK as a legislative entity. Cultural inclusiveness is a key ingredient to ensuring democratic parity throughout the UK. \n\nThe dissemination of findings of this project will take place over a 2-5 year period after the completion of the research. The communication of these outcomes will be through at least one exhibition mounted within the PoW, extensive use of the parliamentary website, publications and public talks. All of these forms of dissemination will involve the resident PoW legislators, museum personnel throughout the UK, meetings with academics through conferences and seminars, as well as meetings with archivists, librarians and the general public. Teaching and learning packs as well as workshops will help disseminate this material to a wide range of users. It is especially envisaged that connections will be made with the devolved assemblies/parliaments in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast as well as with interested foreign legislatures who recognise the need to inform their publics about the visual language of parliamentary institutions.\n\nThe research outputs of this project will encourage the study of the material culture of parliamentary institutions which will inform discussion especially within the Anglophone Commonwealth. The Westminster parliament has had a great influence on comparable structures in such dominions as Canada (Ottawa, completed in the 1920s) and the methodology used in this project could influence mutual projects elsewhere. As such this project will offer a major contribution to heritage studies both within the academic community and beyond. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024038/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
