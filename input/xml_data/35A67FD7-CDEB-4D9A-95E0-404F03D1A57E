Why can visually impaired university students in Ghana not use and read educational materials previously converted for the blind in the UK by the RNIB, particularly as there would be no revenue loss for copyright owners? If many people in India and China cannot afford proprietary, copyright-protected computer software, is it surprising that 'pirated' software is so widespread ... or is 'one nation's 'piracy' another person's technology transfer'? (Jaszi) If copyright is a necessary precondition for creativity, as some argue, how have rai music flourished in Algeria or oud music in Lebanon for so long? And why and how are long-standing systems of cultural production here and elsewhere across the South being disrupted by the individualistic ideology of copyright? How can there be a global 'fair trade' in copyrighted products when only a few countries, chiefly in the North, are doing the overwhelming majority of the selling (e.g. of software and films) and the rest of the world's peoples, including those in the global South, are doing most of the purchasing? \nThese are but a few of the more provocative questions to be assessed in this legal research study of how the western-based copyright system has recently been transformed, especially since the mid-1990s, from an 'international to an internationalised' legal phenomenon (Gana). The effects on the global South have been deeply-felt. For example, the complex web of existing national cultural, artistic and literary production and distribution patterns in the South are being broken apart and these areas, among others, are being transformed into captive markets for primarily western-produced and copyright-protected 'expressions', to use the copyright term of art. \nSeveral chapters are ready for next-to-final edits. Other chapters, which will be started in January 2007, will build on earlier works, including my own in the same field (see CV). Some existing studies will be criticised for their overly Eurocentric bias and their failure to investigate and analyse the 'on the ground' ramifications of the pervasive spread of global copyright webs and restrictions. And although practical and 'grass roots' resistance is building across the South, there is a paucity of analysis assessing the long-term assumptions of the 'new' forms of cultural production that are emerging, especially in digitised formats. \nThe four main areas of inquiry: a) the political economy of North-South copyright relationships, including how copyright doctrine reinforces inequality; b) cultural commodification; c) access to knowledge materials, especially for teaching; d) the copyright 'alternatives' being proposed. \nIn addition to a critical review of the findings of existing studies, the research will primarily be conducted - for time and financial reasons- by at least 50 lengthy telephone interviews (to start in January 2007) with already identified key informants on the three continents across the global South, including many who work daily on copyright's 'front lines' in these countries. (Their contact details are held by the Copy/South Research Group, which I chair). This research method has previously worked successfully in a detailed 2002 report completed for the Department for International Development (DFID) on a related subject. \nThe intended audience includes the following: academics, both in IP law, world trade law, and from other disciplines in the South and North interested in copyright and related issues of globalisation, librarians, 'information activists', especially those from the global South, cultural producers in the South, international aid and development agencies, such as DFID, UNCTAD, and the South Centre, and officials from and delegates to the World Intellectual Property Organisation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25557</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E004512/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6F2E89E-46FA-4084-B88C-26D28FC989C6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Common Law inc.
