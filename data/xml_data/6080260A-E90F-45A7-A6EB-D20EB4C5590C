&lt;p>The project explores how, from the 1870s, charities increasingly used consuming, promoted by advertising, as innovative fundraising techniques, and produced empirical knowledge or ?technologies? to stimulate donations from the public to humanitarian causes. Notably, charities began to actively market the ?purchase? of a commodity as a form of donation whereby the ?donor?/ buyer received a tangible product in return for their gift. Engaging with developing consumer cultures, charitable organisations were able to negotiate what we now call compassion fatigue and, to generate income for causes without necessarily tapping into a moral or sentimental mentality.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The exploitation of the desire to consume became, during the period under study, a pivotal ?technology of compassion? in the armoury of multiple British charitable organisations competing for donors. This hypothesis is located within an historical context where, first, philanthropy for domestic causes (poverty was the most common cause) increasingly competed with appeals for global disasters and, secondly, a vast expansion in print and consumer cultures enabled charities to develop innovative strategies in pitching for donations.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>284072</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Imposter!

This discussion mapped the historical context onto contemporary issues of giving and highlighted to us just how pertinent the issues of accountability and authenticity are to a 21st century public.

In brief, the project examined the late 19th and early 20th century relationship between charitable fundraising and capitalism. It was exceptional as an historical study of 19th and early 20th century charities in the breadth of its data set: we researched the archives, personal papers, publications and artefacts of regional, national and UK-based international charitable organisations and personnel to give a unique overview of charitable fundraising and management practice. It examined the appropriation by voluntary organisations of 'enterprise' as a mode of fundraising and the introduction of financial auditing and authentication in charitable structures. This has direct relevance to a variety of NGO and fundraising organizations in the light of the recent (21 September 2015) parliamentary report on charity fundraising (https://www.ncvo.org.uk/images/documents/policy_and_research/giving_and_philanthropy/fundraising-review-report-2015.pdf). 

The bulk of the interaction with international humanitarian organizations was facilitated by ongoing research co-production taking place in Manchester. The University hosts the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute with 4 pillars to its research and teaching: Medical humanitarian action, Humanitarian Studies, Disaster Management and Peace Studies. The CI is director of HCRI and the PI is a member. HCRI delivers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in these areas. Many students, especially at PG level, are seconded from NGOs. Both the PI and CI have used the research from this project in delivering teaching at UG and PG level. HCRI has a research partnership with major world leading non-governmental organisations: UKMed (a major DFID funded NGO hosted by HCRI see www.Uk-med.org), M&amp;eacute;decins sans fronti&amp;egrave;res (MSF), Save the Children (SCF), the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC), International Alert (IA), Mines Action Group (MAG). This research has also fed into publication in practitioner - focused publications and contributions to international and European humanitarian workshops addressing the following issues from a long view: how NGOs and aid agencies create a 'brand' identity; how they market their 'cause'; how they innovate in fundraising; how they audit and authenticate donations. The 'impact' dimensions here revolve around putting current issues at the heart of NGO fundraising practice into historical perspective. Prime examples are twenty-first century agencies' concern over payment of executive salaries, management and auditing of finance, brand identity and fundraising techniques. For instance, the recent debacle over Kids Company financial management should have been foreseen - not only from warnings in the months preceding the charity's collapse but from the very structure and market profile of the organisation. Kids Company's rise and fall shows striking parallels with large charitable organisations in the late 19th century that enjoyed public support but suffered chronic mismanagement, scandal and often collapse that left beneficiaries in dire straits. The research project suggests a) models for locating current issues in a longer view to understand the genesis of and responses to recurring problems; b) models for anticipating difficulties in fundraising and management issues; c) models for training practitioners in awareness and response to recurring fundraising and management issues. This area of impact has a broad and ongoing remit.

A second area of impact is through dialogue with the Catholic Church and fundraising organisations on fundraising practices and ethics throughout the Catholic diaspora. The RA for the project has developed the research we completed on Catholic fundraising to work with Catholic charitable practitioners and the Catholic Church. This has also developed into an independent ESRC Future Research Leaders project working with practitioners and the Catholic Church: Visible Divinity: Money and Irish Catholicism, 1850-1921.

Finally, the project has generated a specific Impact project in Manchester to work with Wood Street Mission, a major Manchester charity founded in 1869 that continues to provide poverty relief for children in Manchester and Salford. WSM formed one of the major case studies in the research. This project is in partnership with Wood Street Mission and Trevor Johnson, the creative director of Manchester based design company, Havas. WSM had a turbulent 20th century in terms of resourcing and reach, encouraging a rethink of the charity's scope and mission in a shifting political, social, economic and increasingly secular context. WSM faces ongoing challenges as it approaches its 150th anniversary (2019), not least because 'austerity' has increased demand for its services while placing its donor market under pressure. The WSM brand is strong among its traditional donor base (including UoM) but it could - and arguably should - have a bigger presence within the city region and without (and the concomitant donor base). WSM has made an important shift in this direction with its current exhibition, 'Queues, clogs and redemption' (PI involved) and the launch of a WSM 'real Victorian ale' by local Marble Brewery. The Pilot Impact project is in its infancy but will facilitate key research into the role of heritage in the WSM brand and a survey of what WSM (broadly conceived) sees as the key challenges in sustaining traditional donor patterns while accessing new donor markets. The ESRC project brought the benefit of comparative histories - notably with Barnardo's and The Children's Society - charities that bear striking similarities to WSM in service delivery, longevity and brand recognition and their respective use of heritage as a marketing strategy in a context of local, national and international competition. It is anticipated that the pilot will generate an Impact Acceleration Account bid to develop the mapping of WSM's current donor market with recommendations on expanding that market and developing strategy towards brand promotion. We also anticipate submission of a collaborative Heritage Lottery fund bid to exploit the charity's heritage and potentially tap new funding streams and marketing strategies in its anniversary year, 2019.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A09B9677-C1D5-4B08-BBA1-C7670AF67AD9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>560c33a7e30209.99180711</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The objective of the study was to identify how charities used consuming, promoted by advertising, as innovative fundraising techniques, and produced empirical knowledge to stimulate donations from the public to humanitarian causes, 1870-1912. 

Achievements: 
1. New knowledge 
The vast majority of existing scholarship focuses on voluntary action, the dynamic between donations and civic status, single organisation histories and the 'scientific' distribution of welfare to recipients. The major achievement of this project is its new emphasis on charity as a competitive marketplace that not only appropriated developing patterns of consumption and enterprise but actively innovated too. The outputs from this project therefore make a major contribution to an area of scholarship that is often considered familiar. 

2. Major collation of research resources
The project collated extensive empirical data from charitable organisations, missions and disaster funds in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. These ranged from one-off fundraising campaigns for extraordinary disasters (domestic and global) to small, localized charities to larger organizations with a global reach (such as Barnardo's and the Salvation Army). We also surveyed the personal papers of major donors and key philanthropic personnel of the period. This was supplemented by data from newspapers and periodicals pertaining to fundraising campaigns but, also, commentary on the contested politics and ethics of fundraising. We believe this is one of the few studies on charity in this period to draw on such extensive data from so many diverse organisations. 
 
3. New research questions 
One of the principal innovatory achievements of this research is its focus on financial data (fundraising targets, techniques, receipts, invoices, individual campaign accounts, end of year audit reports etc.) in the context of broader material concerning organisations' aims and personnel, donor and recipient markets, fundraising literature and so on. Likewise, the project specifically analysed charities' bureaucratic practices, especially evaluative processes. Notably, the most dynamic organisations at a regional, national and international level developed robust cultures of evaluation and accountability. Although existing scholarship has drawn attention to the role of the Charitable Organisation Society in policing inefficient and, sometimes, fraudulent organisations, our project draws attention to the agency of charities in exposing suspect organisations as a means of self promotion and authentication. 
The project's focus on the competitive marketplace highlighted how organisations developed a notion of 'compassion fatigue' (the late-twentieth century term for the public's increasing disaffection from perpetual demands on their purses for humanitarian causes) and produced innovative strategies to combat it. We identified a thriving culture of constantly updated branded merchandising (often piggybacking on broader consumer trends), schemes that rebranded 'giving' as 'consuming' whereby the donor received products or experiences in return for their donation, and the exploitation of dramatizing narratives in the press, periodicals, theatrical spaces and visual culture. A major achievement in this research was to include insofar as possible 'failed' charities and unsuccessful fundraising strategies in our data to effectively map the dynamism of the market. 

4. New networks
We have historicized issues of direct relevance to NGOs today (accountability, authenticity, compassion fatigue) leading to productive exchanges.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the absence of an established scholarship on charitable enterprise, we developed innovative analytical frameworks. We anticipate sustained engagement and feedback from the academic community on how successful these frameworks are and in response to the multiple new research questions our project posits. 
The sheer volume of data collated will generate outputs beyond those projected in the initial application. Several sub themes in the book warrant development as essays in their own right; others will be developed as standalone projects. The RA has generated a bid examining the social meaning of money in a migrant charitable context; the PI will develop a project on the difficulties of fundraising for the socially excluded.

We have consistently shared our research findings informally with NGOs through the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute and published research findings in a practitioner journal. We will apply for an Impact Acceleration Award to generate a series of workshops on themes of direct relevance (compassion fatigue, accountability and strategic innovation) to NGOs (eg., Save the Children and the Salvation Army). We are currently in discussion with Manchester University Press about developing a three-volume handbook co-written by academics and practitioners historicising key issues in contemporary humanitarianism.
