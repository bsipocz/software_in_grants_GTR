and health service cost. More than 600,000 people within the UK suffer from leg ulcers at any
one time, with prevalence increasing with age.
Leg ulceration is most commonly caused by venous hypertension resulting from valvular
incompetence in the superficial, deep, or perforating veins. Sustained venous hypertension
causes swelling, restricted blood flow and damage to the skin and other tissues. Most ulcers
are associated with venous disease, but other contributing factors include immobility, obesity,
trauma, arterial disease and diabetes.
The management of leg ulcers represents a significant clinical challenge and a major drain on
financial resources. In the UK, the treatment of venous leg ulceration represents a total cost to
the NHS of nearly &amp;pound;600m a year. Much of this cost is accounted for by community nursing
services with district nurses spending up to half of their time caring for ulcer patients. The
personal cost to each individual with ulceration, is however un-measurable.
Compression is the standard therapy for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. Sustained
graduated compression controls oedema and supports venous blood flow back to the heart.
The most effective level of compression to overcome venous hypertension has been
determined to be around 40 mm Hg at the ankle and 15 mm Hg below the knee. Of the range
of bandages currently used for leg ulcer treatment, multiple layer compression bandages
specifically designed to produce predetermined levels of compression are classified as the best
current solution.
Despite such measures, surveys of reported practice of leg ulcer care have demonstrated that
practice often falls short of that which is ideal with much related to the training and
experience of the practitioner. A study delivered by 3M (Schuren &amp;amp; Mohr 2008) involving the
application of 744 compression bandages indicated that sufficient graduated compression was
observed in only 53 applications (92% failure).
In addition to patient discomfort, poor management of leg ulcers increases healing time and
accelerates re-ulceration rates, leading to additional costs in treatment.
Through the current project, SFH aim to address the need for improved accuracy in
compression therapy. Their unique ?pressure sensor? technology (patent applied for) will
enable the optimum levels of graduated compression to be reached with 100% accuracy,
thereby increasing rates of healing and improving recuperation. The technology will enable
qualified, but non-specialist nursing staff to apply appropriate levels of compression and by
minimising the time taken to apply bandaging, will allow for cost reductions and greater
patient throughput.
The project aims to develop a basic prototype of the technology demonstrating the technical
feasibility of the approach. If successful, further prototyping will ensue with market entry
within 18 months.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90153</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710014</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
