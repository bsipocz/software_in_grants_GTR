The degree and scale of cooperation varies considerably across human populations and many authors attribute this variation to cultural differences. However, it remains unclear what drives this cultural variation. A substantial body of theory in evolutionary biology predicts that demographic characteristics of populations, such as their size and patterns of migration, may be important drivers of cooperation and competition. But these theoretical ideas have never been empirically tested in human populations, so it remains unclear whether evolutionary models are useful tools to explain variation in patterns of human cooperation. This study will be the first to empirically test these ideas in a set of real- world populations in order to investigate whether demographic influences on cooperation and competition explain the cultural variation observed across populations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will generate a large-scale, longitudinal behavioural dataset of cooperative behavior in multiple populations of two small-scale Indian societies with contrasting patterns of migration. Economic games, behavioural surveys and quantitative behavioural observations will be used to measure levels of cooperation. These data will be used to test whether the contrasting patterns of migration in these two societies affect social networks and levels of cooperation. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of this research include both UK and international policy makers managing public goods such as land, water and energy resources as well as those running community development and disaster management programmes. In addition this study will also benefit immigrants by identifying factors that can improve their integration into the community. Finally, the study will benefit the study populations amongst whom the research will be conducted. 

Migration and population expansions are a central and imminent concern of all governments. This study will provide insight into the effects of these demographic processes on the maintenance of cooperation and social cohesion. Specifically, the project will examine how these demographic forces influence the solution of public goods dilemmas including participation in public works. These findings will be very relevant to policy makers focused on preventing the over-utilisation of land, water and energy resources. The study will help identify how population size and rates of migration affect the stability of cooperation in a social group; this may specifically help managers of community building and disaster management programmes design refugee camps of the optimum size in order to prevent a breakdown of social organization. 

The successful social and economic integration of immigrants is a major and ongoing challenge for the United Kingdom. Every year since 2004 around 600,000 people have moved to the UK, and approx. 80% of these are non-British citizens (Office for National Statistics: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/). By examining how migration affects the social networks of different cultural groups, the project will address timely questions about the types of links that we need to build between migrants and non-migrants in order to improve the integration of the latter and maintain cooperation in a multi-cultural society such as that in the UK. 

This study will provide employment to over 20 local residents at the field sites in India who will be hired to assist with the fieldwork. The research assistants will be trained in questionnaire administration and data processing, transferrable skills that they can use to gain future employment. Although springs will be built in 10 study populations in order to study how individuals organise themselves in the building of public works, these springs will provide long-term access to clean drinking water, an extremely valuable resource for these populations.

The findings will be disseminated to the general public via media press releases, a website, a public event and a documentary film about the research (particularly the building of the springs). The film will focus on how people solve public goods dilemmas and will be produced in collaboration with an independent filmmaker with links to the University of Exeter; it will be screened at various Universities and other public venues as well as entered in film festivals and made available via the project website.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>232653</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Daniel Syiem Ethnic Fashion House</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with organisation called Daniel Syiem Ethnic Fashion House in Meghalaya (India)</gtr:description><gtr:id>49964F7B-A8C0-4BF5-B772-6BF475ADAD57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has enabled me to conduct long-term research at this field site.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b8753c81146.16803857-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The organisation is providing us logistical support, aiding access to study populations and helping us manage the field station and staff employed there.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have developed a long-term collaboration with this organisation to set up a long term field station and conduct longitudinal research at my field site in Meghalaya India.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Chaupal</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with NGO called Chaupal in Chhattisgarh (India)</gtr:description><gtr:id>7555FB18-E27B-4D94-A4C2-882D3B344410</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has enabled me to conduct long-term research at this field site.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b867eb00017.26437392-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Chaupal is providing us logistical support, aiding access to study populations and helping us manage the field station and staff employed there.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have developed a long-term collaboration with this grassroots NGO to set up a long term field station and conduct longitudinal research at my field site in Chhattisgarh India.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1700</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of Exeter Link Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Exeter</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>542CA429-9DEA-44A4-9395-F0B83092539D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c040a5070145.54073946</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>478000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Royal Society University Research Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2021-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Royal Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B584A59C-D945-480C-8EA5-F7E670A2ECD9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c0414645fae7.52233061</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project on well building (section 2.2.3 of original proposal) has been very successful. We have built wells for water in 6 remote villages in India for this project. 6 of 10 study villages decided to build a total of 24 wells; the remaining 4 villages declined citing self-organisational constraints. 15 of 24 wells are complete and are being actively used by people in these villages for drinking water, washing and in some cases irrigating small fields. We are currently conducting follow-up surveys and observations to quantitatively measure the impact of these wells on water use and availability in the villages where they have been built.

The above summarises the immediate impact of our work on the ground. The majority of our findings are still to come in the next 2 years as we analyse the large-scale dataset that we have collected over the past 3 years.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2BF59C0C-6D6E-460B-BE4A-5D74A533462B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb3d433e1b0.69229468</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Over 3 years I have met most of my data collection objectives. We have collected a large-scale dataset across 20 Indian villages (10 Korwa + 10 Khasi) including data from economic games, behavioural surveys, cooperative spring building, demographic, individual, genealogical and social data (see sections 2.1 to 2.5 of original proposal) for most adults. The project on well building (section 2.2.3) has been very successful. 6 of 10 villages decided to build a total of 24 wells; the remaining 4 villages declined citing self-organisational constraints. 15 of 24 wells are complete and we have collected video and non-video observational data on the building process. We now have a unique dataset across villages varying in their ability to organize and create a public good. I am collaborating with a film maker, David Jobanputra, to make a documentary film about the well building project (see original 'Pathways to impact'). We filmed the project as it unfolded since 2015 and are now editing. Since I have received a one year no-cost extension on this grant, we are currently conducting follow up surveys to quantify the impact that the wells have had on water use and availability in the villages in which they were built.

As this is a very large-scale dataset we continue to process the data and will soon start analysing it to see what we have found with respect to the original aims and questions of this project. In other words, the major findings of this project are still to come and will unfold over the next 2 years. We aim to include our findings in the film that we are making and arrange photo exhibitions and public viewings of the film in various parts of the UK and in India, including in our study villages.

I also plan to put the dataset we have collected on an open science platform (to whatever extent I can given ethical considerations) once we have anonymised and prepared it.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Over the next 2.5 years, we will obtain the core findings from this project, complete the film we are making, create a photo exhibition to go with the film and make all of these available to the public, academics and policy makers via a number of exhibitions and screenings across the UK and India, including in our study villages. We will make all of this material available online via the website I have already created during my fellowship (http://shaktilamba.com). I anticipate that our findings will be of interest to many different kinds of people from academics (Anthropology, Evolutionary Biology, Economics, Sociology, Psychology, Demography etc) to policy makers (government and non-government) in a number of sectors (environmental resource management, public works, economics, demography etc). I believe the questions my work addresses, to do with the creation and maintenance of large-scale cooperation in society and the effects of our environment and demography on it, are of fundamental interest to all human beings, now more than ever before. I hope my work, including the methods I have used and the scales on which I address these questions, will contribute to understanding these issues and designing cooperative institutions, organisations and societies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CA388626-C784-43FA-BA6E-08DC7857479C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb444877241.47537278</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://shaktilamba.com/research-2/well-building-project/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>33ABCD79-513C-4A38-8AE3-95D131E9CE67</gtr:id><gtr:title>The empirical evidence that does not support cultural group selection models for the evolution of human cooperation.
