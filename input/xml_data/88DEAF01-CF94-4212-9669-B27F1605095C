They are responsible for 15-20% of paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 5% of adult AML. Mixed lineage leukaemias in general have a dismal prognosis - as few as 14% of patients diagnosed with mixed lineage leukaemia AML are cured. This is in contrast to other types of childhood acute leukaemia where cure rates are as high as 90%. 

Mixed lineage leukaemias are caused by chromosomal rearrangements that result in the Mixed-Lineage Leukaemia (MLL) gene fusing abnormally with other genes. This rearrangement leads to the production of an aberrant fusion protein (MLL-FP) that is thought to drive the leukaemia by activating target genes that would not normally be expressed.

A potentially exciting approach to treating resistant cancers such as mixed lineage leukaemias, is the development of small molecule inhibitors that specifically target aberrant processes in cancer cells but leave normal cells unharmed. In order to be successful, such an approach requires highly detailed information about cellular processes in cancer cells on the molecular level. 

Thus, there are at least two reasons why research into MLL-FP AML is important. Firstly, we need to improve treatment of this subset of acute leukaemias. Secondly, in order to do so, we need to understand molecular mechanisms specific to MLL-FP AML and in the process, discover information about key pathways that may be applicable to leukaemia in general.

In this project, we will use several strategies to understand the role of MLL-FP target genes that have previously been identified. We will use technology such as &amp;quot;RNA interference&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;genetic engineering&amp;quot; to specifically inhibit the expression of our genes of interest in MLL-FP leukaemia cells. We will then examine the effect of such inhibition on leukaemia survival. We also aim to identify the changes in downstream gene expression when our target genes are inhibited. We believe this strategy will elucidate the requirement and function of our genes of interest and may identify specific pathways amenable to therapeutic intervention.

The work will be part of a PhD project conducted in the MRC supported Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, principally conducted by a Haematology specialty doctor training to be an academic clinician, and specialising in the care of this group of patients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>MLL-rearranged leukaemias are driven by epigenetic dysregulation through the activity of the resultant fusion protein (MLL-FP) on a small set of target genes. The transcription factor RUNX2 has been identified as a potential gene target of MLL-FPs. Preliminary data suggests it is required for leukaemia maintenance. However, little is known about downstream effects of RUNX2 binding.

We hypothesise that RUNX2 expression is required for maintaining MLL-FP leukaemia growth and will use MLL-AF9, a common childhood MLL-FP AML, as a model to study the requirement and function of RUNX2 in this context.

Aims
1) To determine the importance of RUNX2 in maintaining the leukaemic growth of MLL-AF9 human cell lines and 2) primary transformed mouse cells 
3) To determine the molecular mechanism of RUNX2 activity in MLL-AF9 leukaemias 

Methology
Aim 1) Human MLL-AF9 cell lines will be transduced with doxycycline-inducible RUNX2 shRNA. Functional consequences of RUNX2 shRNA knockdown will be compared to controls and analyzed in vitro using colony forming, apoptosis, growth and proliferation assays and in vivo in xenograft assays
Aim 2) Murine tamoxifen-inducible Runx2 knockout (KO) bone marrow cells will be transformed with MLL-AF4 retrovirus. Runx2 KO and control cells will be compared for i. Runx2 mRNA and protein loss; ii. leukaemic potential both in vitro and in vivo; iii. apoptosis, cell cycle proliferation and growth. We will also use genome editing technology to make an MLL-AF9 knock-in and inducible Runx2 KO model. This expresses a fluorophore only when Runx2 KO is successful, allowing in vivo monitoring.
Aim 3) We will use a combination of the above techniques with time-based ChIP- and nascent RNA-sequencing to identify downstream effects of RUNX2 binding.

Scientific and medical opportunities
Understanding the molecular mechanisms through which this epigenetic regulator exerts its effect may identify specific pathways amenable to therapeutic intervention.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

As outlined in the Academic Beneficiaries section, researchers both within and outside of our immediate research field will benefit from this research. Beyond researchers, other direct beneficiaries could include industry and clinicians. In the long term, MLL patients could potentially directly benefit from this research.

Indirect beneficiaries of this research include educators and the general public.

How will they benefit from this research? 

Academic researchers will benefit directly as outlined in the Academic Beneficiaries section, but industry also has the potential to benefit directly from this research. The UK is a site of many industry-academia collaborations. For instance, the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) is a partnership between several structural biology labs and companies such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Companies such as GSK provide validated probes or other such research tools and the academic labs perform cutting edge basic research that can be used as a guide for future drug development. This entire process is influenced by other basic research, and our work on RUNX2 has the possibility of providing proof of principle experiments for the future development of therapeutic probes. In the long term, if RUNX2 (or RUNX proteins in general) are valid therapeutic targets, the development of small molecule inhibitors could eventually have an impact on patients, especially those with aggressive leukaemias that don't respond well to conventional therapy.

Another way this could research could have an impact is in the area of clinical diagnosis. Our preliminary work already suggests that RUNX2 expression may be a marker of poor prognosis, and this could aid clinicians.

Educators will indirectly benefit from this research. Any science that has the potential to influence other researchers could produce knock on effects that result in changing our understanding of basic biological concepts. For instance, if we are successful in establishing RUNX2 as a potential therapeutic target in MLL leukaemias, this will increase research output in multiple ways. It will increase interest in better understanding the role of RUNX2 in haematopoiesis, more structural and mechanistic research will be done on the RUNX family in general, and more interest will be focused on understanding RUNX transcription factors in cancer and how they effect changes in chromatin and regulate target genes. This will have an eventual impact on education as new concepts arise and replace old models.

The UK has a very strong past record of innovation in drug development. As a result, the pharmaceutical industry is an important component of the economy in this country. The attraction of the UK as a place for drug development is partly due to fostering interactions between industry and academia and the perception that the UK is a world leader in basic research. The experiments outlined in this proposal are a small part of maintaining that edge and thus indirectly benefit the UK economy as a whole.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>235624</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oxfordshire Science Festival - ATOM!, Market Square, Abingdon</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC77B3B7-ED8D-4461-A76F-FF17DAEDCC11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public outreach activity as part of Oxfordshire Science Festival.
