Such judgements employ what moral philosophers have called 'thick' concepts, in contrast with 'thin' concepts (such as 'good,' 'wrong,' or 'ought'). A distinctive feature of thick concepts seems to be that they somehow hold together both evaluation and non-evaluative description. To say that 'Water boarding is cruel' is to convey that water boarding is bad in a certain way precisely for the way it causes suffering, whatever else (such as its illegality) may be bad about it. An influential literature has built up in recent decades concerning the nature of this distinction between thick and thin concepts and its significance to the nature of moral discourse and moral disagreement, the objectivity or relativity of values and their place in the world of natural facts, and the role of values in shaping our practical thought and reasons for action. \n\nThis project studies two main questions: In what way do thick concepts hold together evaluation and description and, given the way they do so, are thick concepts of any distinctive significance in moral theory or our practical thought? It will advance the current state of the art on these questions both in its methodology and in substance. Its transforming methodological contribution is to extend rigorous methods from current linguistics and philosophy of language to examine previously unconsidered linguistic data concerning the phenomenon of 'objectionable' thick concepts, as well as linguistic data in support of the alleged variable evaluative valence of thick concepts and in support of the claim that the evaluative and non-evaluative aspects of thick concepts cannot be separated because their non-evaluative meaning is by itself too indeterminate to stand alone. Its foundational theoretical contribution is a novel theory of thick concepts. The best explanation of the relevant linguistic data is that the evaluative contents associated with thick concepts are not parts of the concepts or otherwise essential to them but rather are presupposed in their use. And the best explanation of why their non-evaluative contents are not fully determinate in abstract is that they are typically multidimensional in a way which makes the satisfaction conditions of many thick concepts context-sensitive. \n\nAccording to this presuppositional theory, thick concepts hold together evaluation and description in a way which makes the two aspects separable rather than irreducibly fused. This does not challenge certain contrasts between 'facts' and 'values,' but advises subtlety in such distinctions. The theory gives thick concepts no distinctive significance regarding the objectivity or otherwise of value, but it does require thick concepts to be evaluative in a different way from the thin (which presumably are not evaluative merely in their presuppositions). Hence the account raises the deep question of what it is for concepts and judgements to be evaluative or normative in the first place. The account also explains why thick concepts behave distinctively in certain sorts of moral disagreements, especially those that arise when one person or group regards the very concepts of another objectionable, as modern Westerners might regard concepts like chastity or lewdness (because of the kind of sexual morality they invoke) or certain fundamentalists might regard concepts such as tolerance. Culturally specific beliefs and customs often find expression in distinctive thick concepts (e.g., purity and untouchability, or indeed autonomy and tolerance). The explanation of why thick concepts carry their evaluative presuppositions helps us understand various intra-cultural and inter-cultural conflicts of values between traditions, practices, and perspectives with distinctive repertoires of value concepts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We routinely call people or their actions 'brave' or 'callous,' or 'generous' or 'rude,' artworks as 'sublime' or 'gauche,' policies as 'sensible' or 'wasteful,' and so on. Such judgements employ what moral philosophers call 'thick' concepts. These differ from 'thin' concepts (e.g., 'good,' 'wrong,' or 'ought') in that they hold together both evaluation and non-evaluative description. While the research is fairly theoretical (it aims to analyse the nature of thick moral concepts and their philosophical significance), it has three groups of beneficiaries outside PI's immediate circle. \n\n(1) Contemporary multicultural societies require policy-making to coordinate diverse groups with distinctive cultural, ethnic, religious, and ethical outlooks and practices. Thick concepts tend to acquire their point from culturally specific contexts. Such cultural beliefs and customs often find their expression in distinctive thick concepts (e.g., various concepts of untouchability and purity, or indeed concepts such as autonomy and tolerance) or distinctive interpretations of widely shared concepts (e.g., what is encompassed by concepts of honour, cruelty, or familial loyalty). Claims to rights to live by traditional beliefs and customs may thus not always be easy to assess, and policies may induce conflicts which may be hard to resolve if expressed by culturally specific thick concepts of those affected. The research has potential to increase the effectiveness of public services and policy and to benefit other public and third sector actors, such as those working with faith groups or in multicultural communities. It can help them navigate these sensitive public arenas by helping them improve their grasp of intra- and inter-cultural conflicts of values between traditions, practices, and perspectives with distinctive repertoires of value concepts. This ranges from disagreements concerning acceptable school clothing, animal slaughtering rituals, and the like, to disagreements which arise when some regard the very concepts of others as objectionable. Liberal Westerners might object to concepts like chastity or lewdness because of the kind of sexual morality they invoke, or to concepts which are used to approve things they disapprove, such as concepts embodying the admiring attitudes of warrior societies towards acts we deem brutal. Certain fundamentalists might object to concepts such as tolerance. The research therefore has broad relevance in contentious and much-discussed arenas of public life. \n\n(2) Potential beneficiaries also include segments of the wider public. The research has potential to enhance nation's self-understanding of its cultural past and present. (a) It contributes to understanding aspects of multi-culturalism, as detailed above. And (b) it provides devices for historical contextualisation of our predecessors' thinking, such as understanding the different moral customs and ways of thought which such concepts as chivalry or chastity convey at different times in the nation's history. \n\n(3) Academic beneficiaries outside philosophy can be found in linguistics, anthropology, theology and religious studies, social policy, and politics. Benefits to them are detailed in 'Academic Beneficiaries'; potential collaborations with them to engage beneficiaries and maximise impact are described in 'Impact Plan.' \n\nEffective delivery of the research to beneficiaries (1) and (2) can be achieved by developing accessible presentations which apply the analytic tools provided by the research to detailed knowledge of concrete and timely issues of multiculturalism and the channels for disseminating such. Faculty of Arts has various resources in place to support PI in developing an impact strategy and precedent in helping colleagues in philosophy to disseminate their research (see 'Impact Plan').

Such judgments employ what moral philosophers have called &amp;quot;thick&amp;quot; terms and concepts, in contrast with &amp;quot;thin&amp;quot; terms and concepts (such as 'good,' 'wrong,' or 'ought'). A distinctive feature of thick terms and concepts is that they somehow hold together both evaluation (calling someone rude is a way of saying something negative about them) and description (to count as rude, one must violate certain social conventions, cause hurt feelings, or the like). The philosophical orthodoxy is that the evaluative aspects of thick terms and concepts are built into their literal meanings in the same way as their non-evaluative aspects are so built. Relying on a wide range of linguistic evidence and theoretical considerations, this project argues that the evaluative aspects of paradigmatic thick terms and concepts are better understood as a certain kind of conversationally generated implications of their use. This means that thick terms and concepts have no deep distinctive significance to moral philosophy, contrary to prominent claims that thick terms and concepts undermine the fact-value distinction and shed novel light on such issues as the meaning and objectivity of evaluative judgments and the place of values in the world of natural facts and their role in shaping our actions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One important aspect of the project's central argument is based on the behavior of thick terms and concepts in the special kind of moral disagreements that arise when one person or group regards the very concepts used by another as objectionable, as modern Westerners might regard concepts like chastity or lewdness or certain fundamentalists might regard concepts such as tolerance. The progress that the project makes in our understanding of such disagreements in values has potential use in those non-academic contexts that involve inter-cultural or cross-cultural conflicts of values between different evaluative perspectives, practices and traditions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1A83CD9A-156A-4C5D-8246-7D853F08A3D4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9173118620.340824775ec4f2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-lewd-the-rude-and-the-nasty-9780199314751</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0608EF0C-E9D8-45B3-990F-F810E994093D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shapelessness in Context</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>No?s</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/acb57463d1d044d2941527e4a89b71cd"><gtr:id>acb57463d1d044d2941527e4a89b71cd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>V?yrynen P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d067067b0497ff</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2785C867-6C1F-42C3-AEA6-6170B74B3903</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oxford Studies in Metaethics Volume 7</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/acb57463d1d044d2941527e4a89b71cd"><gtr:id>acb57463d1d044d2941527e4a89b71cd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>V?yrynen P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199653508</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>r_129148367291cf0892</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E2564ABF-4E01-447D-98F3-696555CC9F73</gtr:id><gtr:title>Thick Concepts</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/acb57463d1d044d2941527e4a89b71cd"><gtr:id>acb57463d1d044d2941527e4a89b71cd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>V?yrynen P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199672349</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>r_776648131191cf09a0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77087186-0209-42E4-88F3-7C25CFF1BDF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Thick Ethical Concepts</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/98a7d2c150b81483156d750ec705d8fe"><gtr:id>98a7d2c150b81483156d750ec705d8fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pekka Vayrynen</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5899c1fb3898e5.14350744</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0C7C20D6-70E9-4BF8-A266-A6DC9927BED2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Lewd, the Rude and the Nasty: A Study of Thick Concepts in Ethics</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/24e8c4a122cb6aad5e2a20f37755162c"><gtr:id>24e8c4a122cb6aad5e2a20f37755162c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vayrynen Pekka</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199314751</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_40667633863bf1e812</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H038035/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>613C584A-2828-41FD-B276-95CC04EA3952</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Aesthetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6E6227B6-029E-4DD5-8ADF-6D46BE6CEE4D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language &amp; Philosophical Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D3B0FA4C-49C7-4E19-A8D5-F19B1145C2CB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Semantics &amp; Pragmatics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
