The study has provided a set of well characterised, standardised particles which differ in particle size and chemical composition enabling us to systematically examine the effects of these particle characteristics on their biological effects.

We have examined the toxicity of nanoparticles with three different sizes and three different chemical compositions to a fungus, an aquatic alga and a freshwater invertebrate, assessing both uptake and toxicity of the particles by these organisms. Polar particles were of low toxicity, but hydrophobic particles were very toxic to Daphnia, with toxicity increasing sharply at smaller particle sizes. 



We examined whether the particles increased or decreased the toxic effects of three common pollutants. Some alterations of toxicity were observed, but the effects were small in magnitude.



The results allow us to start drawing generalisations about the likely environmental impacts of nanoparticles and the ways that the physical and chemical characteristics of the particles alter their biological effects. They show that both particle size and particle composition are important influences on nanoparticle toxicity and that nano-sized particles of normally inert materials can be very active biologically.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The nanoparticles that we have synthesised may be of value as reference toxicants</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3950BF1C-3024-42B5-988D-537329C588CE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1009314564.0653694774f4540</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/E014933/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6A654DB9-716E-4BAC-867B-E1CE45A994F6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecotoxicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC6B2467-35B6-4997-9582-1BF957B82697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
