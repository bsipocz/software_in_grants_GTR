Given, the current lack of activity in the housing construction market to achieve this target, increased levels of off-site modern methods of construction (MMC) need to be adopted which conform to future regulatory and code requirements, are environmentally sound and structurally robust. The dominant form of timber construciton for housing in the UK is open panel platform frame construction (approximately 25% UK market share). In order to meet future market and building regulatory requirements this form of construction needs to evolve and become an efficient closed panel system solution. The system solution needs to be capable of being manufactured off-site to the highest possible specification in terms of mass customisation, inclusion of services, application of cladding, and to achieve a high standard of building performance (thermal insulation, reduced cold bridiging, acoustic separation) whilst remaining cost effective.Off-site MMC research has primarily focussed on: understanding the market; the conceptualisation of modern building systems and products; the adaption of production theories to construction; implementation of modern business processes to construction by means of adapting information and communication technologies; and micro-renewable solutions (photovoltaics, ground source heat pumps etc) to provide additional energy.It has been recognised that sustainable building envelopes should start with improving the efficiency of the building fabric. The evolution of timber plaform frame from an open panel to a closed panel system solution requires increased levels of off-site MMC and improved building performance.. This impacts upon the structural performance and requires the deriviation of novel technical solutions and incorporation of innovative products. Running concurrently with this is the need to structurally design and certify all new building systems in accordance with the new European Code of Practice as a result of the British Standard Code of Structral Practice now being obsolete (as of the 1st of April 2010).This research work will progress through testing in isolation, and in combination, novel technical solutions and innovative products which will form the timber closed panel system solutions of the future. These derived solutions will be used in pilot projects to demonstrate their application and, through post completion testing, overall system efficiency. Further to this the work will provide a generic product family architecture in accordance with Eurocode design requirements providing industry confidence in the code and the ability to specify the derived solutions or adapt them for their specific market or client needs.The proposed research work will be part of a wider scale research movement and therefore provide necessary outcomes for the implementation of sustainable and efficient methods of construction required to address the existing UK housing shortage. The work will support the UK timber frame industry and its suppliers in terms of both raw materials and services (i.e. consulting engineering practices). The project will also ensure that timber frame remains competitive relative to other less sustainable forms of construction and imports.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is timely given the forthcoming environmental and structural legislative requirements, the need to provide affordable houses and enhance the UK manufacturing base. The UK needs to implement a sustainable strategy for meeting the housing shortfall and with respect to this it needs to meet the social, environmental and economic needs of the present without comprising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Primarily, however, sustainability requires design in the broadest sense to be at the centre of the development process; critical to the design process, particularly when considering off-site MMC, is structural design. The project will be closely aligned with the requirements of industry and government agencies. Edinburgh Napier University has strong links with a range of industry partners as well as the British Standards Institution (BSI), UK Timber Frame Association (UKTFA), the British Research Establishment (BRE), Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA) and the National House Building Council (NHBC). These strong links will be used to disseminate the information either via the project Research Advisory Board or other collaborative mechanisms that are already in place such as the Construction Industry Advancement Centre (CIAS). By exploiting these mechanisms the project will also influence future building regulatory and structural design requirements as well as create increased levels of cross industry collaboration ensuring that derived solutions are generic and beneficial to the industry as a whole. The purpose of the project is to enhance the UK industry and not provide individual companies with a competitive advantage within the sector itself. This said, it is expected that company specific spin off projects will be instigated by the project to the benefit of the industry partner. Pilot projects in collaboration with industrial partners will be developed to showcase the project innovations. Results will be disseminated to industry via technical notes and industrial engagement seminars. Information from the project will also be disseminated via routes such as a dedicated project web site and software applications. Further to this research, workshops and seminars will be arranged and the project will report its overall findings at dedicated conferences. Journal (IstructE &amp;amp; ICE) and external conference papers will be published and presented (WCTE 2012 &amp;amp; 2014). Dissemination will also occur through the Scottish Construction Forum and trade and industry organisation events. Information from the project will be embedded into teaching and industry CPD material. The project will build on published work by the lead investigator including the TRADA &amp;amp; IStructE (2007) Manual for the design of timber building structures to Eurocode 5 and Hairstans (2010) Offsite and Modern Methods of Timber Construction - a sustainable approach published by TRADA Technology. It is highly likely that this proposed project will lead to further industry collaboration such as KTPs and academic collaborations building on the knowledge created. The project will also create a legacy of licensed products and processes to the industry that will generate income. Therefore, Edinburgh Napier will become the place for structural timber off-site MMC expertise and knowledge in the UK and Europe. Dr Hairstans has already demonstrated his ability to identify, manage and deliver industry research requirements and has also developed the communication network required to ensure that this project has the necessary impact. Overall the project team will develop professionally towards membership of the Institution of Structural Engineers and Institution of Civil Engineers, develop key project management competencies and enhanced knowledge of sustainability policy, building performance legislation, construction and manufacturing techniques ensuring they have key skills adaptable to other employment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102452</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Commission</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:department>European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Low Carbon Building Technology Gateway</gtr:description><gtr:id>D17204FE-D64C-48FB-8A32-05E4B91E4D1D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- LCBTG01 - Cube retreat SIP details: strucutral review of structural insulated panel details for future building regs.

Funded by a research grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and part of a PhD research, the University's aim was to promote the structural use of timber, develop innovative solutions to assist with the specification of closed panel systems and to integrate these into engineering software used by commercial structural engineers.
The first Tedds calculation resulting from this partnership enables racking walls to be designed in line with the &amp;quot;unified&amp;quot; approach detailed in the Provisional Draft 6693 document. Following a rigorous testing process, this EC timber racking calculation is now included within CSC's structural calculation software, Tedds, and is also available within the free trial version.

Demonstrated at the Timber Expo in Birmingham and at EcoBuild 2014 in London, COCIS continues to develop further Tedds calculations for EC5 structural design and is currently developing a number of calculations to streamline the design of a range of commonly specified connections.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3DE8F9BE-75C3-49E1-818B-473DC9C7FB93</gtr:id><gtr:impact>16,000 engineeris use the Tekla Tedds software and now have access to a unified approach to designinging timber frame racking panels inclusive of closed panel detailing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460f899499754.87862647</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Tekla Tedds Timber Racking Calculatioin to Eurocode 5</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaaF6MqBeEk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E789CA6C-6699-40D7-BFC0-26415994A484</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural behaviour of timber frame closed panels for specification in the United Kingdom</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/01ff8a7a53d5ce7ed4f431a56e5fa134"><gtr:id>01ff8a7a53d5ce7ed4f431a56e5fa134</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Menendez, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54624500dd8782.97803319</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>82755117-F9F1-4BA4-ABD8-CD1C52B27F00</gtr:id><gtr:title>Offsite HUB (Scotland): establishing a collaborative regional framework for knowledge exchange in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Architectural Engineering and Design Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4b429da94cdcc776e5bf08510bdd922b"><gtr:id>4b429da94cdcc776e5bf08510bdd922b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hairstans R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a8d6f46145949.27761865</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AA0FE34E-BE45-43F9-8A5D-F048641A1618</gtr:id><gtr:title>Build Building Offsite: An Introduction</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5b576f7a68baeae448da7b8b6c52e5db"><gtr:id>5b576f7a68baeae448da7b8b6c52e5db</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hairstans Robert</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781904320104</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8d6e2d672420.88084983</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5F82E069-5A26-4625-9DDC-92EC293B4B5E</gtr:id><gtr:title>A structural engineering platform for timber modern methods of construction</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/01ff8a7a53d5ce7ed4f431a56e5fa134"><gtr:id>01ff8a7a53d5ce7ed4f431a56e5fa134</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Menendez, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_325538629413e2003c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>39062835-DCC2-4141-9DE9-F781DD64243F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Accoya Structural Design Guide to Eurocode 5</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/19cc7f86ae517509586730d33e5489a4"><gtr:id>19cc7f86ae517509586730d33e5489a4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawrence, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_950743829963df8bbe</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2DB8B2AE-DF34-4934-ACAA-CFE9BEBFBFDD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural design with Accoya wood</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Wood Products Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5bbfac07a09549153773e26467f4c9c1"><gtr:id>5bbfac07a09549153773e26467f4c9c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bongers F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54622a48b73aa5.39845541</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05F119CC-8ECA-4921-A97C-559767577A68</gtr:id><gtr:title>.
