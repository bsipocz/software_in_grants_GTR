Model checking applies these ideas to provide powerful automated tools for verifying that software meets its specification. This can save companies money and provide confidence to wide society of the reliability of software. Conventional model checking has been enormously successful industrially, but much of it has considered time as discretely ticking - 0, 1, 2, and so on. For some computer systems, continuous time as used in physics is more appropriate. Part of this project will study the possibilities for model checking in situations concerning real-time models, using a very powerful logic, the temporal mu-calculus. In the long term, it may lead to new ways of model checking more sophisticated systems.

As well as time, space is an important aspect of many modern applications, including databases, geographic information systems, and geometrical reasoning. Logic can also be used to make statements about space, and reason with them. Many different logical systems have been used, but again the very powerful mu-calculus has not been greatly investigated in this context. This project aims to study the modal mu-calculus in spatial contexts, trying to ascertain its expressiveness, and what machinery is needed to reason correctly with it. The work has the potential in the long run to improve our ability to specify and reason about situations involving space.

We will also take the opportunity to try to establish some fundamental facts about the mu-calculus's power to define classes of situations, echoing the so-called Goldblatt-Thomason theorem for simpler logics. If successful, this will provide researchers with a basic tool usable in many areas requiring the mu-calculus.

Only three months is available for the research on this ambitious project, and it is likely that not all problems will be solved, but we hope that good progress will be made.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed work involves fundamental theoretical research, and it does not aim to make an immediate contribution to practical computing. This is quite deliberate and intentional. The problems identified for attention are intricate and worthy of full attention in their own right. The immediate impact of the work will be primarily on the academic community, principally those working in logic, in particular the mu-calculus, spatial logic, temporal logic, model checking, and algebraic logic. These topics are studied primarily in computer science, but also in mathematics and philosophy, and in some specialised logic departments such as ILLC in Amsterdam. Workers in these fields will benefit technically by having available the theorems and algorithms developed during the project. New logical methods developed during the research will be of technical and cultural benefit to them.

Part of the research concerns logics for representation and reasoning about space. Space is obviously an important aspect of many modern computer applications. There are many approaches to spatial logic, but few results are known on the spatial mu-calculus, so the project has the potential for impact by discovering new methods that may find application in these areas and benefit their workers and users. 

Another part of the research concerns model checking formulas of the temporal mu-calculus against real time or linear time models. This is novel ground, but conventional model checking is now a major industrial enterprise. The results of the research may in the longer term have impact on industrial practice, by making available knowledge of how formulas of a powerful temporal language can be checked against more general kinds of temporal model than are commonly considered. Model checking is used to verify that a computer program meets its specification, and is thus 'safe'. Improving the safety and reliability of software is of benefit to wide society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7314</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The work is attracting interest and has now led to 4 publications, but it is fundamental research and I do not expect non-academic impact in the short-medium term.

The NZ visit was to Robert Goldblatt in Victoria University of Wellington, primarily to work on the modal logic of space. (Work on defining classes of Kripke frames in the mu-calculus was also planned, but unfortunately no progress on this topic was made, because of lack of time.)

In a classic paper from 1944, McKinsey and Tarski set up a basic logical language for representation and reasoning about space. The notion of space they used was called a 'dense in itself metric space', a mathematical abstraction general enough to cover many common cases and applications of space in practice. They gave simple reasoning principles, called S4, and showed by a powerful argument that all and only the valid statements about any given space were derivable in S4.

McKinsey and Tarski's paper has been massively influential, with nearly 500 citations (Google Scholar) and many related publications, especially in the last decade.

Goldblatt and I extended this work to stronger languages with more powerful operators: the mu-calculus (called the 'ultimate program logic' by Vardi), the so-called tangled closure operators (we showed they are as expressive as the mu-calculus in any metric or topological space), the universal modality (which can express non-local properties), and the coderivative operator (as recommended by McKinsey and Tarski). For languages without the universal modality, we gave strong completeness results, covering infinite sets of statements; we also showed that this is frequently impossible with the universal modality. The work has been published in two substantial journal papers, one of which has appeared (59 pages), and the other of which has been accepted for publication (36 pages). 

The work has led to an additional, shorter publication containing analogous results for the real line and 0-dimensional spaces, which has appeared in Proceedings of Advances in Modal Logic 2016. A further journal paper on algebraic aspects of the work has appeared online.

Our work has advanced the state of the art in this area. Items 1-4 of workpackage P1 of the proposal were all fully resolved. I regard this part of the project as now having been completed successfully.



The Australia visit (workpackage P3) was shorter. I visited Mark Reynolds's group in University of Western Australia, Perth, and the aim was to study model checking temporal logic over linear and real time. Temporal logic model checking is a powerful technique used to verify protocols, device drivers, and increasingly, more sophisticated software. It has major industrial significance.

Model checking over general linear time or real-numbers time is a less advanced field, but recently, two algorithms were put forward independently by Reynolds's group and by Mathioudakis in London. We wished firstly to compare the two. We concluded that they were sufficiently similar not to warrant including Mathioudakis's algorithm in a forthcoming paper by Reynolds et al. The more pressing question was to extend one or both of these algorithms to handle mu-calculus formulas. Preliminary results have shown tentatively that this may be possible, with Mathioudakis's algorithm being the lead candidate. Some results have been obtained, but substantial technical challenges remain. Very heavy administrative duties have prevented me from completing the work so far, but I hope that at least one full paper will be produced in due course. Details will be added here when available.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Various open problems are posed in the spatial logic paper above, chief among them being to extend our results to a wider class of topological spaces, and to even stronger languages.
