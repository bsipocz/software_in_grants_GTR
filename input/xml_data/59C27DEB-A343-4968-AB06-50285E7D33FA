Langlands program is a web of conjectures predicting precise relationships between automorphic forms/representations and representations of Galois groups, thereby providing a profound link between analysis and algebra. It is the motivating force behind much of the research in Number theory today.Classical modular forms are examples of automorphic forms defined for the group GL(2,Q). In the 70's J.-P. Serre defined p-adic modular forms: objects that are obtained from p-adic analytic variation of modular forms. Ever since their introduction by Serre, p-adic methods have been pivotal in progress in the theory of automorphic forms.Ground-breaking results of Hida (80's) and Coleman (90's) for p-adic modular forms prompted a surge in research applying p-adic methods to the study of automorphic forms for groups other than GL(2,Q). Along with the recent progress in the p-adic representation theory of Galois groups, this research has led to the emergence of the beginnings of a p-adic Langlands philosophy. This is mostly a mystery at the moment but it informs a lot of research in the area. A link between the classical theory and the p-adic theory is given by criteria of classicality : they tell us which p-adic modular forms are classical modular forms and are in general hard to prove.A powerful approach to the study of p-adic automorphic forms is via geometry: more precisely, the study of the p-adic geometry of Shimura varieties. It was Katz who highlighted the power of a geometric approach: he recast Serre's theory of p-adic modular forms using the geometry of spaces called modular curves and provided many applications. Many of the recent approaches to the construction and study of spaces of p-adic automorphic forms are of a geometric nature. At the core of this proposal lies a plan to study aspects of the (p-adic and mod p) geometry of certain Shimura varieties (and of maps between them) that have emerged as essential in the study of p-adic automorphic forms, and especially in proving classicality criteria for them. In addition, we plan to use such results to construct and study canonical subgroups of abelian varieties. These are objects at the heart of our method for proving classicality. We intend to end the proposal by demonstrating applications to classicality of p-adic automorphic forms.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The UK has a strong tradition of research in Number Theory. In the modern times, much of the mainstream and prestigious research in number theory has been carried out within the framework of the Langlands Program. This is a series of precise conjectures predicting profound links between seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics. The conjectures are breathtakingly beautiful and have brought together algebraists, analysts, and geometers in a quest to unravel the mystery. The conjectures are divided into two broad subcategories: local and global. The lion share of the UK's contribution to this area has been to the local Langlands Program. In an international review undertaken on behalf of EPSRC and CMS in 2004, while Number Theory was cited as one of the areas in which the UK is a world leader, it was recommended that work on the global Langlands program is one area of number theory that could be developed and expanded further. Since then, there has been a tangible increase in the activity on the global Langlands program in the UK. In fact, the UK is becoming one of the world centers for research on what is emerging as a p-adic version of the global Langlands Program. The proposed research intends to tackle problems that are fundamental to the development of this program. We believe that successful implementation of projects like this will further establish the role of the UK in this area. Given the quality of the research carried out in the UK in the realm of p-adic Langlands Program, we believe that the UK has the potential to benefit from more interaction with outside mathematicians, especially those from North America and France where there are strong research groups in this area. We have devised this proposal in a way that it involves many visits to mathematicians outside the UK. On one hand, this is necessary for progress in the project: substantial problems have been proposed and a timely tackling of these problems is only possible with collaborations with and visits to mathematicians of different expertise. On the other hand, we believe that such visits, especially when involving mainstream research, will promote further collaboration between researchers inside and outside the UK. Since it can take a number of years before a substantial project is carried out and published, visits can help assert the global influence of UK mathematics in a timely fashion. Such recognition could, for instance, lead to an increase in the UK's share of outside grants (such as European Research Council grants).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>94654</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The proposal set out to study the (p-adic) geometry of certain spaces called Shimura Varieties with a view towards potential application to theory of (p-adic) automorphic forms. We achieved the following:

1. We used a combination of certain technical tools (including Breuil-Kisin modules and mod-p geometry) to understand the p-adic dynamics of Hecke operators in middle regions of Hilbert modular varieties that was a mystery to the experts for several years before this work.

2. Using the above insight into the geometry of Hilbert modular varieties we proved many cases of the celebrated Artin conjecture over totally real fields under the assumption that 5 is unramified.

3. In a collaboration, we furthered the above results by studying the geometry of more complicated Hilbert modular varieties, thereby proving many more cases of the Artin conjecture.

4. In another collaboration, we used our ideas to prove an important case of the Strong Serre conjecture for totally real fields (assuming the weak version). This case of parallel weight one had not been covered by the recent breakthroughs in the subject.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings have already been used by other mathematicians, both directly (using my results to prove new results) and indirectly (using/generalizing the approach to prove more general results). Also, there is currently work going on to further generalize the ideas and the methods. 

In our statement of impact, we had indicated that the proposed research would be a step in the direction of the recommendations of an International Review of UK mathematics in 2004: &amp;quot;Work on the global Langlands programme is one area of number theory that could be developed and expanded further, since it has become one of the main sources of motivation for research in arithmetic, geometry, number theory and representation theory internationally&amp;quot;

 The research carried out with the support of this grant has achieved a step towards that by proving an important conjecture within this framework.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8351FADF-04A0-400B-B382-055CAEBC3D28</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd855e742612.14048576</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0B4C1230-24EA-4D57-A34E-72218942767C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modularity lifting results in parallel weight one and applications to the Artin conjecture: the tamely ramified case</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Forum of Mathematics, Sigma</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/db1ef8c77e544f794a265440fe92095b"><gtr:id>db1ef8c77e544f794a265440fe92095b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>KASSAEI P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e046d93d9311.52126846</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5E4244D3-9D71-4F84-97CC-077CF5280926</gtr:id><gtr:title>Companion forms in parallel weight one</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Compositio Mathematica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2cfb3fc90c75c02fc0d4bafab825ef44"><gtr:id>2cfb3fc90c75c02fc0d4bafab825ef44</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gee T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e0431bd56420.09254040</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0E3E53E8-E492-4E50-B0C9-045D960AFB69</gtr:id><gtr:title>ANALYTIC CONTINUATION OF OVERCONVERGENT HILBERT MODULAR FORMS</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ASTERISQUE</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/923b0711a374255da5ab2a40053cac72"><gtr:id>923b0711a374255da5ab2a40053cac72</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kassaei Payman L.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0303-1179</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58be22a3a031b5.47400196</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>751A1BB0-5396-4C11-B202-0CF74E5689D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modularity lifting in parallel weight one</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the American Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f69b3e52ea4f4df1a7f9f4e688db45e6"><gtr:id>f69b3e52ea4f4df1a7f9f4e688db45e6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kassaei P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d045045893c2db</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H019537/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
