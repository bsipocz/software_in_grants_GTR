Such mechanisms are thus given a will of their own and are widely believed to have the capacity to act upon that will to enforce outcomes which otherwise would not have arisen. The populist phrase 'you can't buck the market' is the perfect illustration of this way of thinking, and it feeds perceptions of powerlessness insofar as people are deemed to have lost control of their own destiny in the face of abstract but controlling market logic. Yet behind these pronouncements of the omniscience of market mechanisms there lie any number of analytical assumptions which tend not to be reflected upon at all. We are told that the market is able to assert particular behavioural priorities onto us, but typically we are not told why. The power of the image of a disciplinary force is usually enough on its own to render believable the message contained within the image about the dangers of rebelling.

The most significant of the covert assumptions underpinning such social and political passivity is that markets are able automatically to coordinate individual economic activity in pursuit of the best possible outcome. In technical language this is the presumption that they 'clear' perfectly if left alone to perform their task of matching supply faultlessly with demand. This is how the populist conception accounts for the fact of market coordination, through which myriad instances of everyday economic decision-making cohere into a functioning economic system. Unfortunately, real-world markets have a tendency to depart from the accompanying image of allocative efficiency, as was demonstrated only too vividly by the colossal allocation failures which occurred in and around the global financial crisis. Such real-world difficulties are almost certainly related to the fact that at no point in their subject field's history have economists offered an unequivocally economic solution to the issue of market coordination: solutions couched in logical and mathematical terms, yes; solutions couched in genuine economic terms, no. The so-called market coordination problem is described specifically as a 'problem' for good reason, then.

My project seeks to reveal some of the ways in which the ongoing inability to resolve the market coordination problem has been rendered increasingly unimportant for academic economists. Professional developments have occurred within both the methodology and pedagogy of economics which have allowed that problem to be almost entirely sidestepped. Methodologically, it is possible to identify a number of turning points from the 1820s to the 1930s which increasingly moved economics to become a 'science of choice', thus eliminating interest in the effects of the broader market environment in which individuals are called upon to choose. 'The market', as a substantive phenomenon of concrete everyday relationships of buying and selling, has consequently all but disappeared from economics research, albeit leaving economists susceptible to the accusation of being out-of-touch in moments of acute market distress. Pedagogically, from the 1870s onwards, students have learned to understand the fundamental economic essence of individual choice through exposure to examples drawn from a hypothetical Robinson Crusoe economy. No coordination is necessary in a one-person desert island setting, which turns the question of how markets work into a mathematically-tractable exercise in logic. Neither are moments of market breakdown ever allowed to occur, because the underlying logic drawn from the surrounding equations is always able to assert itself. This makes it relatively easy to understand why many commentators have asked for a new type of economics to be developed in the wake of the global financial crisis, one which breaks fundamentally with the mathematical framework in which the Robinson character is forced to live.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project deals with subject matter which is at least one stage removed from the direct concern of policy-makers in search of templates for policy adaptation. My impact strategy recognises the primarily conceptual nature of my proposed research and, as a consequence, it will target engagement within the broader climate of opinion. Using Peter Hall's (1993) terminology, social science research can help to direct 'third order' policy change by allowing the wider population to challenge the language in which policy goals are conceptualised in the first place, and it is at this everyday level of thinking about the economy that I will focus my impact activities. I have identified a number of potential project stakeholders, each of whom, I suggest, will benefit from research which is capable of revealing the generically ad hoc nature of the conception of 'the market' that today dominates the way in which economic policy issues tend to be framed.

This has become a matter of increasing public prominence in the wake of the global financial crisis, as ensuing austerity measures have forced people to come to terms with more limited life chances due to market failure. Many families from disadvantaged backgrounds now routinely struggle to make ends meet because of an increasingly stretched household budget, and many young people are faced with circumstances which make it look as though their generation has been sacrificed economically. I see my role as a potential ESRC champion to connect with these people in an attempt to empower them politically with new ways of thinking about the modern economy's major institution. I will thus combine outreach and impact as a fundamental part of my project activities.

There is now widespread recognition within public debate in the UK - supported by RCUK - of the need to promote new modes of knowledge transfer to groups who might otherwise lack access to higher education. I recently accepted a position on the Advisory Board of the Political and Economic Literacy Project, a community education initiative which is about to be trialled across workplaces, community centres and youth clubs in Oxford. If the pilot is successful the scheme will then go nationwide from the same time as my proposed Fellowship will start. I have already helped with the composition of the syllabus and will lecture during the trial period on the political implications which follow from my research on competing conceptions of 'the market', before taking an even more active supporting role during my Fellowship. These activities will augment 'Schools Days' that I will run at Warwick on the back of the highly successful widening participation initiatives already in place in my department. We regularly visit schools outside of normal university catchment areas to interact with those in the 15-18 age group and have recently organised day-long events for them.

My outreach work will be linked to complementary activities designed to influence ongoing discussions amongst policy advocates about the character of markets and their aptitude for failure. The global financial crisis has focused attention on university economics teaching, particularly on the issue which unites the two elements of my project: how academic economics socialises new entrants to the field into assumptions about 'the market' which do not tackle the market coordination problem. I will interact both with ongoing economics curriculum review groups and those people who run websites, blogs, etc. which have taken a keen interest in those groups' findings. Such interest has snowballed, with film directors, cartoonists and novellists joining the fray amongst others, each having the capacity to create pieces of artwork about the current state of economics knowledge which resonate culturally and politically. More traditional users of social science research, such as learned societies and campaign groups, are part of the debate too, so it is important also to engage them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>236180</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tax Justice Network</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Tax Justice Network Campaign Against the Competitiveness Agenda</gtr:description><gtr:id>4BD1122E-107C-4209-A4C7-63E765205A6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Current outputs relate to various blog posts that I have written, all of which have been recorded under the Publications section.

The title of the talk had been, 'Markets, Markets Everywhere, But Not As You Might Think'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5443761ad6e5e9.59518935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Changing Look of the Market Model in Mainstream Economics: G?rard Debreu and the Influence of the Hilbert Programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5AF2968-6886-4319-BB42-2AB1E9E4207D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>12 academics at a workshop at the University of Birmingham</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b4834e4b1a35.74986398</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Discussion with the Performance Artist, Victoria Melody (Warwick)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE927B56-365F-4FF4-A77B-312013316A9A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a one-to-one discussion, as Victoria was looking for advice on how she might be able to conceptualise the market relationship that will feature prominently in her next project.

The insights of my paper - drawn from my ongoing ESRC project - were taken up in particular by John Christensen, Executive Director of the Tax Justice Network. Further discussions have ensued between me, John and Nicholas Shaxson (an author also associated with the Tax Justice Network), about the possibility of starting a network that would campaign against the implied market logic of pushing tax rates ever further downwards in a competitive race-to-the-bottom.

I was invited to give a talk on fair trade and the way in which the making of fair trade markets differs on the ethical dimension from the making of many other commercial markets.

I had lots of people come up to me at the end of my talk to tell me how my presentation was going to change their shopping habits in the future, as well as subsequent confirmation from a number of people that this is exactly what it has done.

I ended with a challenge to the organisers of future Rotary conferences to see what they could do to ensure that at least some of the food and drink at comparable events was fair trade. The incoming District Governor approached me at the end of the conference to say that he was going to think very seriously about how he would try to meet my challenge at next year's District 1210 Conference. However, I have not yet heard whether I will be invited back to the conference to act as some sort of monitor of their achievements.

I was also approached by the President of Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland, Peter King, to exchange contact details. He seemed interested in the possibility that I might give a repeat performance at the RIBI Conference in Belfast in April 2015 and that my challenge could therefore become more deeply engrained in Rotary practice. No confirmation has yet been forthcoming, however, from his end.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544378e680e8f9.68302787</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Crusoe, Friday and the Raced Market Frame of Orthodox Economics Textbooks</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2C27DBFC-B897-41BC-9AED-A8BB49DD9CE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented to the IPE Masterclass, Department of Political Science and International Studies, University of Birmingham, October 27th 2016 - nigh-on 200 undergraduates and a handful of postgraduate students were in attendance</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b48965ec7d21.87374018</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>There are still two-and-a-half years to go on my award, and so I am still at the preliminary stage of trying to ensure that my fingers prove useful beyond academia. Moreover, I am currently on a twelve-month break from my Fellowship funding so that I can be given time to care for my partner Katie during her ongoing treatment for cancer. The nurturing of impact networks does require quite a bit of time away from home, and unfortunately this has not been possible since Katie's diagnosis last summer. I am hoping that the good start I made in trying to build upon these networks during the first year of my Fellowship funding will not go to waste and I will be able to pick up pretty much where I left off when I am able to reactivate my Fellowship properly. However, I will just have to wait and see whether this will be possible.

However, one aspect of my impact activities that I expect to endure is the collaboration in which I have entered with the Tax Justice Network in their new initiative campaigning against the Competitiveness Agenda. Along with John Christensen (TJN Director) and Nicholas Shaxson (author, journalist and activist), I helped to launch a new initiative which seeks critical engagement with the idea that nations face off competitively against one another in an economic sense. What if there is no basis in economic thinking for such an approach and it reduces instead primarily to a means for already well-resourced economic actors to get what they want out of government policy? This has been the question that we have asked in the new Fools' Gold blog site hosted by the Tax Justice Network. The site emerged on the back of our inaugural meeting, hosted at the University of Warwick, held on February 16th 2015. The meeting brought together academics, lawyers, campaigners and journalists to discuss openly the issue of national competitiveness, to identify ways in which the political agenda surrounding national competitiveness results in a range of policies that debase the fabric of society, and to speculate on the best means to launch an effective political counter-attack. Given the expertise of the people attending our inaugural meeting, it is likely that the initial focus will be on issues relating to the regressive politics of tax competition, but this agenda will certainly broaden in due course. The Tax Justice Network has the goal of nothing less than changing the climate of opinion surrounding the idea of national competitiveness. However, it is convinced that this will have to be a ten-year agenda if the same success it has already enjoyed on issues of tax avoidance is to be replicated. There will, as a consequence, be lots of subsequent activities to be reported on in due course.

I am also moving forward with trying to take my findings out into schools. Later this spring I have a Schools Day at Warwick around one aspect of my project work that I am calling the Colonial Hangover. This will serve as an introduction to the participating students, for whom I have recorded a series of short films to help them think their way further into the major project themes pending me visiting their schools later in the year. I have been gratified with the buy-in I have had from other project partners. The British Film Institute has an outreach programme of its own, and it is my good fortune that it also has an archiving project running this year on the British East India Company, the same theme that I am running through the Colonial Hangover schools project. I have been invited to take some of our participating students down to London for private screenings at the BFI of some of the more exciting things about the British East India Company that they have on film. I also have a round-up day booked into the diary for July 2016, when the participating students will be back on campus at Warwick for a further event including other collaborators. The street artist Inkquisitive has promised to run a workshop around the themes of the project, and the Sapnay Dance Company will also be performing a piece of dance on the themes of the project. Warwick's IGGY platform - a 20,000-strong online community of school-aged students from around the world - will also be hosting the Colonial Hangover project on its website.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AE44ED39-CE48-477E-98FF-EED2E426B1CF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54439bc4c6da98.11143568</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I should point out that I am currently part-way through a twelve-month suspension of my Fellowship, as agreed by the ESRC in consultation with the Professorial Fellowship awards panel. Unfortunately, my partner Katie was diagnosed with cancer back in the summer and has something like a twelve-month recovery time in front of her. Things are going well in her treatment and my project has not been completely knocked off course. But it was still a good decision to ask for a year officially off the Fellowship so that I would be under no pressure to continue making progress with my research at the same time as I have been caring for Katie. I have also agreed a further twelve-month no-cost extension at the end of my Fellowship, which brings my official last day to August 31st 2018.

Given these shifting timeframes, I am happy to report that things are going very well. The findings from the research are developing, and they are showing what I hoped all along would be the case. That is, there are some exceptionally interesting things to come out of an in-depth historiographical investigation of the way in which economic theories of the market have developed over time. I had a hunch at the start of my project that there would prove to be important spill-over effects from abstract economic theory to everyday practices. I am pleased to say that this is just what I am finding. Political justifications of the market exist side-by-side with abstract economic theories of the market, and whilst they might not use the same technical language they do very much appeal to the same themes of efficient allocation and wealth enhancement. This is where the in-depth historiographical investigation really comes into its own, because it shows that the basic market model that has dominated economics for well over one hundred years is susceptible to deconstruction at the hands of more sophisticated economic theory. Every newly beginning economics student is first introduced to a standard demand-and-supply model of the market, and it already appears familiar to them when their studies begin because they will have used the language of demand and supply before that in everyday life. But the most sophisticated mathematical treatments of the market suggest that both the demand and the supply curves are built on a fallacy. This makes the standard demand-and-supply model no less important to political justifications for using market institutions for the regulation of an ever increasing number of aspects of contemporary social life. Yet it does provide plentiful reasons for asking how legitimate these justifications really are.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I will be in a better position to answer this question definitively the further that I progress in my Fellowship. But for now the findings that I am already delivering show that there are lots of ways in which they might be taken forward. They do not present a brand new language of the economy, but they do give substantial reasons for wishing to challenge what has become the standard acceptance of the economic language of the market. They can therefore provide the grounding for lots of activist groups who wish to campaign for social rights to be protected when their continued reproduction appears to be at odds with extant market ideology.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FF031120-6F59-45A4-8BBE-7F162243B3AA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54439b7ad92160.43960461</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy
