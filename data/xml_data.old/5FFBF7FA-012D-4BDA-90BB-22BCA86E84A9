It is the subject of one of the seven famous Millennium Prize Problems posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, of which only one (the Poincare Conjecture) has since been resolved, and has been as well the focus of numerous international conferences and grants awarded in the UK and abroad by scientific agencies such as the ERC (EU) and NSF (USA). However the relevant questions for the Navier-Stokes equations have absorbed the attention of mathematicians since 1934 when the key significant advance to date was made by French mathematician Jean Leray. 

The Navier-Stokes system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), derived as early as 1822, is thought to give rules that approximately determine the motion of fluids such as air and water. There are many issues with this, not only as to whether the equations accurately describe the underlying physics but perhaps more fundamentally whether the equations themselves could give physically relevant predictions. They may rather predict potentially eccentric and purely mathematical motions containing erratic behaviors known as mathematical &amp;quot;singularities&amp;quot;. Of course, from our experience with nature we expect that without significant external forcing this would never happen in reality, and so knowing whether or not singularities could form mathematically would have fundamental implications for the efficacy of the model. Leray proved that the equations always provide at least one predicted motion, and mathematicians have been trying to determine whether these could in fact contain mathematical singularities ever since. 

These are moreover quite typical questions in the analysis of nonlinear PDEs (which tend to be based on phenomena occurring in areas such as physics, biology, finance and sociology) and a resolution to this question would also have a significant mathematical impact with regard to development of robust analytical tools. The EPSRC has in fact recently developed two large funded research centers for analysis and PDEs in the UK, in Oxford and Edinburgh, as well as two doctoral training centers, to try to boost the UK's competitiveness in these mathematical areas. Moreover, much work has been done in the UK, most notably in Oxford, Warwick, London and Sussex, to address and boost interest in the Navier-Stokes and other analytical nonlinear PDE problems.

This project aims specifically to streamline the copious recent efforts to resolve the Navier-Stokes regularity problem and determine effective future directions, as well as to put the question itself, and the idea of mathematical singularities, into a more satisfying context. These goals can be grouped roughly into three parts: (1) characterizing potential singularities, (2) understanding obstacles to current techniques and (3) exploring &amp;quot;singularity&amp;quot; in the context of the modeling assumptions used in deriving the equations. These efforts will give a more comprehensive and qualitative description of the nature of potential singularities. One can then use this understanding to focus efforts to either construct explicit examples of singularities or rule out the possibility of their formation, as well as to put the mathematical question itself into a satisfying modeling context.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will generate significant impact due to the popularity and importance of the mathematical problem addressed, namely the regularity problem for the Navier-Stokes equations, one of the Clay Institute's seven famous Millennium Prize Problems out of which only the Poincare Conjecture has been solved. The impact will be mostly academic (see &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot;), but other impacts include strategic positioning of research in the UK through creation of a people pipeline, strengthening of local capacity in the area and outreach activities which will stimulate local popular interest in this problem and the more general mathematical area of analysis and partial differential equations (PDEs) in the UK. Indeed, the International Review of Mathematical Sciences (IRMS) has determined that the UK lags behind its international competitors in analysis and nonlinear PDEs, and an increase in interest and capacity in this area through activities related to this project will help to redress this issue. The following is a short outline of impact pathways:

1. Academic Impact. The project will result in increased visibility of the research team through publications in top mathematics journals and interactions with leading international researchers through speaking engagements, conferences, workshops and personal visits.

2. People Pipeline and Capacity Building. The visibility generated by the academic impact will help to attract PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to Sussex and other UK universities with strengths in this area such as Oxford, Warwick and London. Indeed, students rely on advice from their supervisors who are active researchers and know where activity in their area is strongest and who the active players are in the global community. An increase in activity in this area in the UK will result in students being encouraged at home to apply for posts in the UK. This will result in an increase in locally-grown talent as well as some of the increased capacity which the IRMS has deemed necessary in this particular area of mathematics.

3. Outreach. Public support and indeed a potential people pipeline will be further improved by outreach activities in the local and surrounding areas. The PI will participate in the Sussex mathematics department's outreach activities including visits to local Brighton sixth form colleges such as BHASVIC and Collyer's, participation in the Brighton Science Festival and presentations at the London Student Conferences, in which Sussex mathematics faculty members have successfully participated in the past. This will help generate support for mathematics research in the UK as well as to inspire young UK students to pursue mathematics in exciting areas in analysis and PDEs such as the Navier-Stokes and related problems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98129</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In collaboration with I. Gallagher (Paris 7) and F. Planchon (Nice), we have shown in our CMP article (DOI: 10.1007/s00220-016-2593-z) that the spatial norm of any strong Navier-Stokes solution in the space X must become unbounded near a time when a singularity develops, where X may be any critical homogeneous Besov space in which local existence of strong solutions to the 3-d Navier-Stokes system is known. In particular, the regularity of these spaces can be arbitrarily close to -1, which is the lowest regularity of any Navier-Stokes critical space. This extends a well-known result of Escauriaza-Seregin-Sverak (2003) concerning the critical Lebesgue space with regularity 0 which is continuously embedded into the spaces we consider. To do so, we followed the &amp;quot;critical element&amp;quot; reductio ad absurdum method of Kenig-Merle based on profile decompositions, but due to the low regularity of the spaces considered we developed and used as well an iterative algorithm to improve low-regularity bounds on solutions to bounds on a part of the solution in spaces with positive regularity. This iterative method will likely prove to be of independent interest.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Methods may be applied in other settings as well.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>00609CDE-BF9B-4351-9875-9F8E28038997</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dfe1b61706a4.21736684</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00220-016-2593-z</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>866193A4-D1D2-4043-937B-75AE6D3CF7AF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Blow-up of Critical Besov Norms at a Potential Navier&amp;acirc;??Stokes Singularity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Communications in Mathematical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c3543d28d282b71e686206ca95536252"><gtr:id>c3543d28d282b71e686206ca95536252</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gallagher I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dfdc19609c47.58754560</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M019438/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
