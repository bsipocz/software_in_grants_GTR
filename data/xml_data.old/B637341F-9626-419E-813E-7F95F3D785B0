It shifts the focus away from traditional research agendas of media discourse analysis: on the one hand, power, ideology and the reproduction of dominant social and political discourses; on the other, the sequential organisation of broadcast interaction as a specialised, institutional form of talk. It also moves away from an overriding preoccupation with news in general in media discourse analysis. It explores the language of new media genres, as well as building on existing work in the field, particularly the most recent investigations into forms of broadcast talk. 

The aim of this book is to explore the genres of language use, or 'activity types' that are pervasively found in mediated interaction. Research in the field of discourse analysis, broadly understood, has already made a significant contribution to our understanding of the organisation of various forms of broadcast talk, including reporting, interviewing, commentating and opinion-giving. However, broadcasting is constantly developing and new media genres are evolving. Various forms of Reality TV, as well as makeover, lifestyle and social-experimental based programming, are now commonplace. 

There is also an increasing level of interactivity between broadcasting institutions and their audiences. The traditional call based 'phone-in' programme now includes the use of mobile phones, SMS and emails, while many radio news programmes now feature opinions and commentary emailed in from listeners. And as with most forms of language use, media genres are also the basis of humour and parody in the more 'performed' contexts for broadcast talk such as spoof interviews, comedy chat shows and satirical news programmes. 

Using theoretical concepts from pragmatics and discourse analysis, 1 examine how different generic forms are used in mediated discourse. This involves a discussion of the relationship between language, interaction and its broadcast context, focusing on the ways in which, for example, reporting, opinion-giving, arguing, advising or story-telling, as linguistically distinct activities, are designed for the public, interactional domain of the broadcasting media, both on radio and television. I also look at how/ the introduction of new communication technologies has been incorporated into existing media genres, and I explore the rich source of material that media genres provide for the creation of parodic texts. 
The book will be of primary interest to scholars, teachers and advanced level students in the fields of discourse analysis, applied linguistics, media discourse and communication studies. It may also attract interest from media studies more broadly, and media professionals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-07-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25272</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E503349/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BC807E7B-C08E-46F6-9E44-E65554CFBA4B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
