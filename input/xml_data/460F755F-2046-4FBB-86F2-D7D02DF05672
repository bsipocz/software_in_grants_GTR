The most important causes of disease are meningococci of groups A, B, C, W135 and Y. Fortunately, vaccines are now available for protection against A, C, W135 and Y and these are based on separating the sugar coat from these organisms and linking them to a common vaccine such as diphtheria or tetanus to form a conjugate. These vaccines have virtually eliminated disease in those countries that have introduced them, e.g. in the UK and US the reduction in group C disease has been &amp;gt;95%. Protection is provided by the ability of the vaccines to induce antibodies in humans that can kill the organisms. 

However, this sugar coat-conjugate strategy will not work for B meningococci (MenB), because the B sugar coat is poor at generating antibodies that can kill the organism and moreover it shares similarities with human proteins, so any vaccine produced using the MenB sugar coat would be problematical. What are the alternatives? For many years, the Neisseria research community has probed the membrane underneath the MenB sugar coat to try and identify those structures or proteins that can induce antibodies capable of killing MenB bacteria. Several techniques have been used, e.g. analyzing the genetic make-up of the organism (the 'reverse vaccinology approach'), analyzing the structure of the membrane (the 'proteomic', 'structural vaccinology' approach) and the human response to infection or colonization by the organism (the 'immuno-proteomic' approach). The reverse vaccinology method has now developed the first generation of defined MenB vaccines, called Bexsero/4CMenB (recently received positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency). This vaccine contains 3 proteins mixed with the membrane from a vaccine used to control disease in New Zealand and is a major step in finding a universal vaccine for MenB. But even this is not without problems: importantly, it is predicted that Bexsero will only protect against 73% of the MenB organisms present in the population. So what about the remaining 27%? Thus, there is a pressing need to identify other components of the organism that can provide broader protection against a larger number of MenB strains. 

Our proposed research is based on our identification of a component that may make up the difference. Using the 'proteomic' approach we identified a protein in the MenB membrane called the Adhesin Complex Protein (ACP). We show that ACP is able to induce antibodies in animals that can kill meningococci. Importantly, meningococci produce only 3 different ACP proteins in a collection of 200 different strains (unlike the proteins in Bexsero which are more variable) and antibodies to one ACP protein can kill bacteria that possess other types of ACP. This is proof of cross-protection. We also show that ACP is important for the organism to stick to human cells. 

Our research plans are to investigate the potential of ACP for MenB vaccine inclusion by gathering further information on the properties of this protein. We have a two-part plan to do this:
In Part 1 ('the vaccine potential'), we will examine whether there are more than 3 types of ACP proteins in a larger number of MenB strains (~600), look to see if these strains produce the protein and also deduce the structure of ACP. We will also prepare new ACP-based vaccines for testing in laboratory animals to see if we can kill a larger variety of different MenB strains.
In Part 2 ('the biological role'), we will deduce how ACP allows MenB to stick to human cells and identify the human molecules involved, examine whether ACP works with other MenB proteins to enable sticking and what responses by human cells are triggered by ACP sticking.

In summary, our proposal is exciting, ambitious, timely and innovative; our research will build on the promising results we have already collected and provide conclusive proof that ACP should be included in new MenB vaccines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Currently, there are no vaccines available for routine immunisation against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis. The most promising vaccine currently with the European Medicines Agency is Bexsero(4CMenB), the product of a reverse vaccinology approach. However, this will not be a 'universal vaccine' as the vaccine antigen composition will provide coverage in the UK of only ~73%. Thus, antigens of greater conservation that can provide cross-protection are eagerly sought. 
We have selected from the outer membrane proteome a protein called the Adhesin Complex Protein (ACP) for study as a potential vaccine antigen. We have shown that ACP can induce serum antibodies that kill heterologous strains and that it functions as an adhesin especially for epithelial cells. Our proposal to MRC is to investigate further the vaccine potential and biological role of ACP. 

1. Vaccine potential: this will involve determining sequence conservation and the number of different ACP types and expression levels amongst meningococcal strains. Anti-ACP sera and monoclonal antibodies will be generated for structural, biological and functional assays. Notably, we will examine the structure of ACP by NMR/crystallography. We will also test different ACP-vaccines for their ability to induce cross-protective bactericidal antibody responses.

2. Biological role of ACP. We will identify the cell surface receptor for ACP using a retagging approach and MALDI-TOF and siRNA gene silencing of putative receptors to confirm identity. The hypothesis that NadA and ACP act in concert to mediate bacterial adherence will also be tested. We will explore the role of ACP in meningococcal and gonococcal tropism for mucosal epithelia and the biological changes that ACP induces in human cells, including receptor-mediated upregulation of inflammatory responses.
Our proposal will provide conclusive proof that ACP deserves consideration for inclusion in new MenB vaccines.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Please refer to the Pathway to Impact Statement attachment for full text (the following is a precis). 
1. Who will benefit from the project's impact and how?
a) Public at risk from infection, especially babies under 1 year of age (at most risk) and young adults: new vaccines to MenB, e.g Bexsero from Novartis will not eliminate all disease; Bexsero in the UK will provide only ~73% coverage against strains prevalent in the population. Our work on a newly conserved antigen may bridge this gap and increase the levels of protection.
b) Industry: We could envisage the incorporation of this additional antigen into vaccines currently being prepared by commercial companies, including Novartis and Pfizer. Our work should be of interest to these major vaccine manufacturers, but also to other companies that have been involved in MenB research recently (but are not advanced as Novartis and Pfizer), e.g. GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur. Thus, there is a potential pipeline of new commercially exploitable products that will generate revenues and add value to the patent process.
c) Scientific and Medical Community, including MRC: these communities will benefit from the generation of new basic knowledge that should have high impact and direct further research into the development of improved second generation MenB vaccines of broader protection.
d) Lay public and families: Dr Christodoulides is currently the Chair of Meningitis UK Scientific and Medical Advisory Panel, and one role is interaction with the lay public and families, who have had direct experience of this disease. Dr Christodoulides provides updates on meningitis vaccines, their success and new research, to both lay public and expert opinion to the national press.
e) Charities: the UK Meningitis charities and Confederation of Meningitis Organisations will benefit from this research by increasing awareness of the need for broadly protective vaccines and that research must be on-going to achieve this aim.
f) Universities: findings from this research project, on publication, will be used in the undergraduate and postgraduate teaching programmes of the Faculty of Medicine, and externally, particularly in control of infectious disease. Dissemination at seminars will enable collaboration.

2. What pathways to impact will be utilized to ensure impact reaches intended beneficiaries
a) Events - public debates e.g. MenUK Vaccine Forum, 2013; co-chaired and organised by Dr. Christodoulides; World Meningitis Day; Meningitis Research Foundation Parliamentary Awareness Reception, December, 2012), University public open days, conferences (IPNC; ASM; SGM, UK; European Pediatric Society conferences), internal seminars and workshops. 
b) Press Activity - providing expert opinion.
c) Communications Activity - Public engagement is a high priority at the University of Southampton and we excel in communicating science to all ages, including children. 
d) Patent and License Agreements: the project will generate fundamental information that can be added to the provisional patent already established for meningococcal ACP. 

3. Timeline of impact and impact activities
Commercial exploitation (patent and license agreements) to be achieved within the 3 years of the project, but inclusion into any new vaccines is a longer-term process and dependent on human trials. Journal publication and conference presentation will be done by Year 2 onwards. Interactions with lay public, affected families, interested parties (parliamentarians, etc.) are on-going activities.

4. Measures of success
The following will be used as metrics of success during yearly assessments and in the Final Report:
a) Academic output: enumeration of publications, conference posters &amp;amp; presentations, number of citations.
b) Financial input: funds raised, other grants received.
c) Collaborations: enumeration of meetings, inter-laboratory visits, material transfer agreements, confidentiality and disclosure agreements.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder
