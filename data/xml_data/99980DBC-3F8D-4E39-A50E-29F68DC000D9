One important question to address is why distinct populations of cells in the brain are vulnerable in these disorders.
Oxygen is vital for life, but certain oxygen species can cause damage to cells if their levels are not properly controlled. In cells in the brain this is particularly important, and it has been shown that a build-up of these reactive oxygen species, also known as oxidative stress, is a key feature of localised cell death in neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, identification of pathways that counteract this oxidative damage may identify new therapeutic strategies that are widely applicable to human disease.

This research programme focusses on investigating the function of a family of proteins that we have shown can be protective against oxidative stress. Importantly, one of these proteins called TBC1D24, when mutated, causes a range of serious neurological disorders. We will use a combination of experiments in cells and also in mouse models to study these proteins. We hope our work will help TBC1D24 patients in the future, but also to understand more about how cells in the brain respond to oxidative stress, a fundamental biological process.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Oxidative stress (OS) is a hallmark of major neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson?s and Alzheimer?s disease as well as ageing. Importantly, OS markers are present in cell populations selectively targeted in neurodegeneration, and pathogenic mutations occur in proteins that feature prominently in antioxidant pathways. OS is also an important feature of many other major neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. This project, focussing on a particular protein family, is to determine how aberrant OS defence pathways lead to neuronal damage, and ultimately whether therapeutic up-regulation of antioxidants could be applied across neurodegenerative / neurological disorders. 

This 3-year Programme builds on data we have generated, demonstrating that a family of proteins, that includes oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1), is a critical component of the OS response in neurons. We have gone on to show that deletion of Oxr1 causes cell-specific neurodegeneration in mice, while the protein itself is also an early marker for cell death in the CNS. Furthermore, in investigating a specific neurodegenerative disease as a proof of principle, we now know that Oxr1 and related proteins can protect against OS when over-expressed in both cellular and mouse models of ALS. Significantly, one of these OXR1-related proteins, TBC1D24, has been discovered recently to be mutated in multiple inherited forms of epilepsy that are also characterised by neurodegeneration; nevertheless, how these mutations cause this range of serious neurological disorders is unknown.

The aim of this Programme is to understand the function of OXR1-related proteins in the OS response and in neurological disease. The project will harness the power of mouse genetics at the Mammalian Genetics Unit (MGU) in combination with our specific expertise in studying the molecular mechanisms of neuronal function and degeneration. We are taking a systematic approach to understand the function of TLDc proteins, examining their potentially unique and overlapping roles in neuronal cells, in addition to determining how human mutations influence key aspects of these functions. Furthermore, we hope to determine whether phenotype-genotype correlations can be identified to assist future clinical outcomes in patients.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1028807</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EEE851B1-9AB4-4B8F-93B5-45B8D5F3304D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Targeted Deletion of the Ncoa7 Gene Results in Incomplete Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis in Mice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of physiology.
