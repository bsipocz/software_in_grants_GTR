The book proposal was recently accepted by the University of Notre Dame Press for a renowned series on the History, Languages, and Cultures of the Spanish and Portuguese Worlds. The submission of the final manuscript is expected in July 2012. 
Based on research conducted in Spanish, Portuguese, British, Indian and Sri Lankan archives for an unpublished dissertation written in Portuguese (2006), the book aims to make a major contribution to the field of Early Modern History by exploring (and clarifying) the emerging &amp;quot;connected histories&amp;quot; paradigm. This paradigm stipulates that it is possible to analyse European and Asian historical processes in connection with each other following the idea that, despite all cultural differences, the parts involved were able to establish historically relevant dialogues. Recent scholarship - including the research that has fed into the present project - suggests that European imperialism did not arrive in Sri Lanka as a sudden shock wave entirely generated in distant places. It grew slowly over a long period of time, and it was to a significant extent produced within the island rather than outside of it. Local ideas of imperial unification, deeply rooted in South Asian traditions of hierarchical kingship and Empire, were transfused into the Iberian sphere through a complex set of communicational channels before they unfolded, in the minds of Iberian imperial administrators, their full transformative potential. 
These findings are important not only in the context of British academia, where both South Asian and Iberian History have long-standing traditions of excellence. A new reading of the sixteenth century is equally important in Sri Lanka where the instrumentalisation of colonial history by radical nationalists is reaching an all-time high in the wake of the government's military victory over the LTTE in 2010. Manichean logics that demonise things non-Sinhalese in the past as well as the present are being deployed systematically with disastrous consequences for the social and cultural tissue of the country. To argue that European power in the island was not exclusively the result of exogenous historical processes does at times stir up emotions - as earlier presentations of my research have done in Colombo in 2005 and 2009 - yet it also serves to return historical agency to certain sectors of the colonized society, an indispensable condition for an open and critical debate about the roots of imperial domination.
The book will also contribute to a critical reassessment of imperial history in Britain, Spain and especially in Portugal, where a tendency to minimise the impacts of expansion and to over-emphasise the &amp;quot;friendly&amp;quot; nature of the early imperial encounters has become palpable in recent years. By offering a nuanced analysis of the transformations that Iberian policies overseas underwent four centuries ago, the proposed work constitutes a cornerstone in the critique of simplistic evaluations of two European countries' imperial past, which may in its turn add to its relevance to the core debates on British imperialism itself.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. General public

This project is expected to have different types of impact in the UK, Sri Lanka and Iberia. The impact on the public in the UK will be primarily indirect and take off once the book resulting from this project is published in late 2012. The output of the project is expected to filter through from the field of Early Modern History into the more widely noticed sphere of writings on British Imperialism and especially the British Empire in Asia. The subject of the book is instrumental to a deeper understanding of the precedents that prepared the ground for British success in Sri Lanka, and may thus become relevant to more widely diffused books and documentaries. A systematic effort will be made to bring the new publication to the attention of widely read and watched British historians. There is also a case for lobbying in favour of the organisation of a major exhibition in the UK on colonial art forms generated under Iberian influence throughout the world (2013-14). Succesful shows have had a considerable public impact in the US, Germany, Switzerland and Portugal in recent years, with many outstanding objects especially from South Asia being held in British collections.

The impact on the public in Sri Lanka is expected to be direct and immediate. Sri Lanka has seen a vivid public debate about the role of the Portuguese, Dutch and British colonisers over the past seven years. This debate started in the press in 2004, when plans were revealed for the commemoration of the fifth centenary of the Portuguese arrival in the island, originating a nationalistic outcry against any events that would not include an apology by the Portuguese government. The debate, which has been fought out in the printed press and online, has also filtered into the blogosphere. A targetted diffusion of the new books' main theses through a small group of key opinionmakers is thus likely to have a wide impact in the short term. In the long term, any piece of genuinely critical scholarship on the country's colonial past will be of vital importance for a strengthening of Sri Lanka's public sphere. Historical research in this field has been virulently politicised over the past decade and needs a maximum of input from informed academics. 

The public impact in Iberia is likely to be comparable to that in the UK, with an indirect diffusion of ideas through academic and semi-academic publications, reviews in one or two national newspapers, the blogosphere and, through intermediaries working in academia and museums, into the field of public collections of colonial art. The issue of a possible official apology to Sri Lanka may create further debate.


2. Academia

The main impact in the academic field - including the countries already mentioned as well as the US and EU - is expected to be in Early Modern History and Global History, a discipline that deals with global experiences especially in the Early Modern period and is increasingly gaining pace in Europe as a complement to World History. Its main forums are the Journal of Global History published by Cambridge University Press for the LSE and the new European Network in Universal and Global History (ENIUGH). The proposed research will be beneficial to the academic output of the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation with that of other countries, especially as it will be published by a major American University Press. Specialist research networks and groups that may further benefit from the output of this project and improve its impact and dissemination are listed under Academic Beneficiaries, and some further information can be found in the Pathways to Impact document. The impact will be generated through a series of talks in select institutions. There is a possibility of working towards an IHR seminar in 2012/13 and a mid-sized academic conference in 2013. My past work and current contacts in the mentioned countries will firmly support the public and academic impact</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38696</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Training Workshop for young faculty at History departments in Sri Lanka</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92E74F2A-C146-4FC7-8727-7126A7F01967</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop targeted young Sri Lankan scholars, some of whom are still postgraduate students, working in History departments across the country, often in remote locations and under very difficult material and poltical conditions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d314eb9629.40035582</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public talk Colombo, Sri Lanka</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DC52D548-00B3-432E-94C0-649F10207317</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to give a public lecture on a topic considered polemic in Sri Lanka. The invitation came from the independent thinktank ICES (International Centre for Ethnic Studies) based in Colombo. The event was advertised in the press, the lecture theatre was more than full, and after the talk a lively debate erupted around the problem of how to evaluate the early colonial period and its consequences on Sri Lanka's development as a nation. This has given dramatic exposure to my work in the country where it most matters. It has generated new contacts and dialogues. 
The talk was also printed and is one sale as a pamphlet at ICES: The &amp;quot;Portuguese Period&amp;quot; Revisited: New Perspectives on Sri Lanka in the Sixteenth Century, pamphlet published as a 37-page booklet in the Lectures/Discussions Series of the International Centre for Ethnic Studies, Colombo, 2012. Whilst this is not an open access resource, it has been selling for a very modest price to the general public attending events at ICES. It has recently been brought up by a Sri Lankan colleague, for example, during a History Workshop for junior faculty at Sri Lankan universities, in which I participated in Colombo in November 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deb3a3350170.10947103</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=57536</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings have fed into a larger national debate in Sri Lanka about the nature of early colonial rule and its impact on the country's development. This is a topic regularly discussed in the Sri Lankan national press. Whilst my name is not usually mentioned, my work has informed the opinions of a number of colleagues. My main direct public impact has resulted from the public talk given on 25 July 2012 in Colombo, which attracted a large audience and generated considerable debate. This has been followed by a series of appearances in Colombo, including a training workshop for young History faculty from Sri Lankan universities, held in Colombo in December 2015. The latter was a wonderful opportunity to exchange ideas with the scholars who will, over the next three decades, train a whole generation of teachers, administrators and opinion-makers in the country. The main objective of the training workshop was to encourage young scholars whose dissertations are usually very local in scope to make supra-local (regional, global) connections. The training - conducted in English, Sinhala and Tamil - was very well received, and further activities are planned for 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1BB51113-F8AA-4CE6-9B38-AD8BFE6948E4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56deb61b8178c7.53070775</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant has allowed me to further my research into the early history of European-Sri Lankan contacts, a key period in the history of this South Asian nation plagued by three successive vagues of colonial dominion. In the sixteenth century, the European nation interacting with Sri Lanka was Portugal, and whilst Portuguese sources on the encounter have been widely available in print, many were never read with much care. My work has allowed a new interpretation to take shape in which the history of early colonial interactions is shaped as much by European push factor as it was by Asian pull factors. Whilst potentially polemic, the devolution of agency to the Asian side of the story carries an important potential for re-interpretation and for a renewed engagement with a key chapter in the making of modern power relations across the globe.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the project have been used by others on grounds of the publications made possible by the project, but also a number of public lectures, talks, and training workshops held in Sri Lanka.
