Development alternatives is understood to mean the diversity of practice and thinking that offers an alternative to mainstream development approaches (e.g. neo-liberal, service delivery, aid-centred, hierarchical, entrepreneurial), in particular, diverse voices and approaches from the Global South rarely heard in development debates and practice. 

Despite their success in terms of meeting targets, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) failed to engage sufficiently with inequalities and the structural causes of poverty and injustice. In contrast, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) present a more comprehensive and inclusive vision of development, partly as a result of a consultative process to develop the goals that incuded the voices of the 'poorest and most vulnerable' (UN, 2015, para. 6). As such, the SDGs may offer space for development alternatives to emerge, but only if there is strong civil society participation to insist on the reordering of development priorities. Exploiting this potential, therefore, will require the involvement of new actors in development policy-making and new ways to encourage the voice and participation of groups traditionally left outside the development process. 

In this context, the aims and objectives of this network are innovative in five main ways: 1) It will be convened by an academic-practitioner partnership between the Centre for Applied Human Rights (CAHR) and Politics Department at the University of York, and the international development agency ActionAid. 2) The network will bring together artists, academics, activists and development practitioners from the UK, Bangladesh and Uganda - Bangladesh and Uganda will serve as regional hubs to facilitate participation from neighbouring countries. 3) The network will critically explore how art and creative activism - and specifically the themes of disruption, performance and translation - can articulate, shape and help deliver development alternatives privileged by those whose voices are often marginalised in development debates, and the extent to which these alternatives complement, enhance or are in tension with the global goals for development set out by the SDGs. 4) The network will deploy creative methodologies, specifically the use of fictional future scenarios, to trigger debate and shape alternatives. Art and activist workshops, followed by national reflection workshops, will be held in Dhaka and Kampala, followed by a final reflection workshop. This timeline of events will build momentum for the research network, and for a series of projects and funding applications on the theme of development alternatives. 5) Through ActionAid and local actors, the network will have clear pathways to impact. 

The network will pursue four pathways to impact: Policy, organisational and practice impacts on NGOs; Public engagement, outreach and local impact in Uganda and Bangladesh; Methodological; Network building. Our most immediate impacts will be achieved within the non-governmental development sector internationally, in the UK and in the regions where the events will take place, but our aim is also to inform the practices, reflections and policies of international organisations (UNESCO, European Union) through our collaboration with ActionAid. Local impact in Uganda and Bangladesh, both recipients of high levels of ODA, will be achieved by working in partnership with local offices of ActionAid and other local actors in Dhaka and Kampala.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network will pursue four pathways to impact: Policy, organisational and practice impacts on NGOs; Public engagement, outreach and local impact in Uganda and Bangladesh; Methodological; and Network building.

1) Policy, organisational and practice impacts on NGOs
Our most direct impact within the NGO sector will be achieved on, and via collaboration with, ActionAid. As a leading international development agency, ActionAid has the capacity to inform thinking in the sector as a whole, in the UK and globally. Our partnership is therefore at the heart of our impact strategy. Specifically, the network will achieve impact within ActionAid and the development sector by providing empirical evidence of the value of art and creative activism for understanding development alternatives and their relationship with the SDGs; developing and testing arts-based research approaches and methodologies that can be used by ActionAid and others to inform their practice; informing the development and design of new programming work; supporting practitioners and activists to better understand the links between local-level work, human rights and grassroots development; and informing future national and global campaigning and advocacy priorities, notably related to critical engagement with the implementation of the SDGs. 

By working with local academics, grassroots communities and ActionAid contacts, the network's activities will contribute to national discussions about development in Bangladesh and Uganda. For example, Bangladesh's next five year national plan will be developed from 2018/9; this network will organise an event to inform this process, led by local academics and activists, with support from ActionAid. 

2) Public engagement, outreach, and local impact in Uganda and Bangladesh
In order to ensure that our findings are known widely within the UK NGO sector, the network will convene an event in collaboration the UK network of overseas development NGOs, BOND, as a way of sharing initial ideas on development alternatives with development NGOs, think tanks and academics in the UK. Locally, the research network will work with ActionAid offices and other local activists to convene similar dissemination events to similar audiences. Art work produced by the art and activism workshops will be showcased at relevant events and exhibitions e.g. the Dhaka literature festival in November 2017 and the Dhaka art summit in February 2018.

3) Methodological 
Development has long been considered chiefly a field for scientific or social scientific knowledge; our intention is to challenge this misperception by working with artists and to encourage and define the value of inter-disciplinary and arts-based encounters and methodologies in development work. We will work directly with ActionAid to ensure that we address this issue in publications for NGOs and contributions to toolkits.

4) Network Building
This network will include an innovative and diverse set of actors. We intend it to be the first step to building a sustainable network and other innovative interventions around the SDGs and Agenda 2030. From the start, the network will seek to develop further projects and funding bids on the theme of development alternatives that specifically aim to take further the methods and impacts we achieve with this bid.

5) Impact Outputs
In addition to academic outputs, we intend to produce outputs for impact. These will include podcasts and short video documentaries; a sound archive of workshops/events; a series of blogs; discussion boards; policy briefs; and contributions to toolkits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47997</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006078/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
