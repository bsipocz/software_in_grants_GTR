Davies's work in this field was varied. It can be divided into 3 broad areas: (1) research and documentation; (2) instrument-building and performance; (3) campaigning and pedagogy. His work in each of these areas was groundbreaking, innovative, and influential--it is not an exaggeration to say that certain features of the present-day electronic music landscape are directly attributable to his influence--and yet his work remains largely unstudied. Consequently, the precise nature and extent of his influence are poorly understood.

The aims of this research are: to enhance knowledge of Davies's work in the three areas just mentioned (no detailed published studies currently exist); to develop an understanding of what, specifically, was innovative about Davies's work by placing it in the context of previous and contemporaneous work in the field; to facilitate a greater understanding of the ways in which Davies's work has been influential by tracing trajectories to present-day episteme, praxis, and pedagogy in electronic music.

The research is archival, and applies methods of science and technology studies (S&amp;amp;TS) to the close study of documents (e.g. Davies's extensive research notes), letters, and recordings, as well as Davies's self-built electronic instruments themselves. The sources are held in archives at the British Library, Science Museum, Stockhausen Foundation (Germany) and Goldsmiths, University of London. They will be studied, along with other published sources that predate and postdate Davies's work, in order to gain a perspective on: (a) what, precisely, Davies's main innovations were in each of the three areas; (b) what precedents there were for those innovations; (c) how Davies's innovations have influenced the way electronic music has been conceptualised, made, and taught.

As a researcher Davies catalogued every single piece of electronic music in existence, publishing the results in his monumental International Electronic Music Catalog (1968). This provided a global picture of electronic music activity for the very first time. Which of the features of this 'global map' were 'Davies's own' and which can be traced back to earlier sources? What has been the lasting influence of this landmark publication? What influence has it had upon subsequent electronic music history, given that it is still the only source that provides a global picture of relevant activities up to 1967?

As an instrument-builder, when electronic music was largely the preserve of a privileged elite, Davies pioneered a new, ecological, democratic form of live electronic music, accessible to all using cheap, everyday, recycled materials. The first of his self-built instruments, the 'Shozyg,' was built in 1968. In what ways were Davies's instruments influenced by his prior work with Karlheinz Stockhausen and Daphne Oram? What has been their lasting influence? What, for instance, is their relationship with present-day hardware hacking and circuit-bending practices?

As a pedagogue Davies established the first electronic music studio to offer degree-bearing tuition, at Goldsmiths College, London. In what ways did Davies's teachings reflect his episteme and praxis? What has been their lasting influence? Can the establishment of studios, courses, and syllabuses elsewhere be traced to Davies?

Three journal articles will be published, one on each of the three areas mentioned. There will also be a public concerts series. The project involves the collaboration of the Science Museum as a project partner. The Museum has a collection of Davies's self-built instruments, which will be exhibited as part of the project, and will host a major two-day international conference focusing on Davies's work and its influence.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Electronic music and its history is of increasing interest to museum and gallery curators, independent film/documentary makers, record label executives, performers and instrument builders, and a growing segment of the general public. These groups are the main beneficiaries of this research outside academia.

Many recent independent films and record releases share direct or indirect links Davies's work. Recent discs include work by Davies himself (2005, 2008) as well as by individuals with whom he worked closely (e.g. Daphne Oram, 2007, 2011; and, of course, Stockhausen) or whose work was documented--often for the first time--in his research (e.g. Tristram Cary, 2000, 2010; Fred Judd, 2012; Michel Magn&amp;eacute;, 2013; Folke Rabe, 2012). Recent films, similarly, focus upon individuals or instruments connected to Davies and his research (e.g. Delia Derbyshire, 2009; Fred Judd, 2011; Mellotron, 2008; Ondes Martenot, 2012). My research will make Davies's substantial body of documentation--as well as his own instruments and music--more accessible as a resource for film-makers and record label executives, enhancing their capacity to research and produce future releases, providing commercialisation opportunities within the next 3-10 years.

The research has further potential impacts among communities of performing musicians whose practice continues the DIY aesthetic that Davies pioneered as an instrument-builder or explores territories charted in his research and teaching (e.g. Ian Helliwell's self-built electronic instruments; John Richards's Dirty Electronics Ensemble; Aleks Kolkowski's explorations of the mechanical and acoustical amplification instruments). By affording new insight to Davies's practice as an instrument-builder and performer and its relationship to current praxis--explored in one of my articles as well as via the exhibition and concerts series--my research has the potential to catalyse new developments in instrument-building and performance practice by enhancin the knowledge of communities of performers, beginning within the Fellowship period.

Through partnership with the Science Museum, the research capitalises upon growing interest among galleries and museums in topics related to electronic music and its history. Recent exhibitions demonstrate this potential. 'Sounding the Body Electric: Experiments in Art and Music in Eastern Europe 1957-1984' (Poland/London, 2012) showcased multimedia works on the boundaries between sound, sculpture, and performance, a territory first charted by Davies in his research. 'Oramics to Electronica: Revealing Histories of Electronic Music' (Science Museum, 2011-date) has as its centrepiece the work of Davies's friend and mentor Daphne Oram and also includes a few of Davies's own instruments. My research will enhance the research capacity and knowledge of museum/gallery curators with interests in electronic music history by highlighting the significance of Davies's research and documentation as a resource, by providing new interpretive perspectives on it that will make it more accessible, and by providing new knowledge of Davies's practice as an instrument-builder and its influence upon the development of electronic music more generally. This will facilitate the staging of future exhibitions, beginning with one staged during the Fellowship, with a larger-scale exhibitions expected within around 5-10 years.

Public interest in 'retro' electronic music has been steadily increasing since the early 2000s, partly driven by links to popular culture (e.g. Dr Who has helped increase interest in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, which staged a sell-out reunion event in 2009 is now touring). The production of films, records, performances, and exhibitions as a result of this research, both during the Fellowship and via its impacts, will further increase public awareness--and hence commercial potential--and enhancing understanding of electronic music, its history, and broader cultural significance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>107381</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An new musical instrument, designed and built by Anton Mobin, in response to the findings of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EDD4AE7C-96A6-4B5D-8A6B-76FC146CA834</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The instrument represents a development of the artist's own individual practice, and will influence the many other notable musicians with whom he interacts, as well as workshop participants and concert attendees.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e19f472f1245.73178075</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Resonant Chamber</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://hughdaviesproject.wordpress.com/instrument-building</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An improvised concert.

In combination with published sources and archival documents held elsewhere, access to these objects informs my research by providing unique material insights into Davies's work. On a different level, the Museum represents one of several contexts in which my research is beneficial, and as such helps me to set research priorities - the existence of a specific collection of Davies's instruments/equipment, for example, served as an incentive to direct research efforts at those particular items, since the Museum stands to benefit from the enhanced description of them that is provided by my research. The Museum also provides guidance on issues such as curation and conservation, giving an inside perspective on the practicalities involved in preserving these objects for researchers and displaying them for the benefit of members of the public. The Museum has also provided support for my research by providing a venue for an international conference - Alternative Histories of Electronic Music - held in April 2016.

More specifically, I contribute to the development of expertise within the Museum in relation to electronic music, its history, and its relationship with science and technology, and to the activities that the Museum undertakes that are relevant to those subject areas, such as workshops, conferences, exhibitions, public demonstrations, tours of the collections, etc. Specific insights that I have to offer include: describing the objects in detail, and situating them in their historic and cultural context, both in relation to Davies's own practice and within the wider field of electronic music; advising on which specific items or combinations of items should be prioritised for public display; providing details of relevant literature, recordings, and other documentation relating to the items.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Science and Media Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Media Museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>8F30762D-7E20-4161-9E83-666857D15244</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outcomes as yet, but we are planning a symposium and networking event, provisionally for July 2017.

The resident, Anton Mobin (http://antonmobin.blogspot.fr/) will spend two weeks in residence, building a new musical instrument inspired and informed by the instrument-building practice of Hugh Davies. At the end of the residency, a public instrument-building workshop will be held, as well as a public concert and a talk at University of Leeds. There will also be a month-long public exhibition showcasing both Hugh Davies's and Anton Mobin's work, at Access Space. The purpose of the residency and associated activities is: (a) to disseminate the research to a wider public audience via the workshop and concert, developing awareness of Hugh Davies and his work; (b) to engage a wider public in activities that provide access to unconventional musical sound-worlds and musical instruments, expanding horizons in these areas; (c) to enable the resident to develop his own practice by engaging with the research findings of the project.

Each of the two elements can be held in one hand. The first element consists of a fan, a switch and a 9v battery. The second part consists of a piezoelectric contact-microphone and a spring fixed on a board (3D printed). The guitar string create the link between the two elements, like a bridge between two towers, attached to both a fan blade and the spring at its end. Ignition of the fan drives the guitar string in a wide rotation and engages vibrations on the spring. Obtaining sound is by direct contact and pressure with the spring support that produces a voltage which reflects the acoustic waves into an electrical signal.
A basic shape is offered to participants, it's up to everyone to turn and see for yourself another design according to the constraint of the materials we have, but everything is still possible!
The challenge is to show simple acoustic principles and give to participants the urge to appropriate these techniques to produce sound differently and give ideas to create new simple interfaces to play daily objects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c00c85867835.46695986</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://antonmobin.blogspot.co.uk/2016/10/designing-interfaces-for-creativity.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Concert of Works by Hugh Davies - 17 March 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>16F6BED6-6782-421F-AD39-DD657FA2A528</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A concert of works by Hugh Davies, rarely or never previously performed, whose scores and performance materials were reconstructed from archive sources as part of my research.

The festival included performances by celebrated free improviser Steve Beresford, vocalist Phil Minton, sound artist Aleks Kolkowski, members of the Edinburgh-based ensemble Grey Area, and live coding of dot-matrix printers by Alex McLean. Each of the concerts was preceded by a pre-concert talk. There were also two public workshops: an analogue disc-cutting and vocal workshop with Phil Minton and Aleks Kolkowski; and a workshop and film-screening on Stockhausen's Mikrophonie I. Overall attendance for the weekend was around 100 audience members / participants, with further national and international participants engaged via a concerts live stream. In an audience survey, concert audiences reported learning about previously unknown modes of musical composition and performance (e.g. use of every-day objects as sound sources, live coding, free improvisation, use of hitherto unfamiliar technologies such as disc-cutters etc.), changing how they think about these areas of creative practice. Numerous composers in the audience reported that this is likely to influence their practice. (For further impacts, see also the separate ResearchFish entries for the two workshops held as part of this festival.) In addition, the festival has already resulted in another national concert date being arranged, 18 March 2016, in Edinburgh, and we are currently discussing the possibility of concerts at Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival and BBC Proms.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c30f4b0b25f5.10721072</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://hughdaviesproject.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/upcoming-concert-sounds-heard/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Concert with Pre-Concert Talk - 23 May 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BF601625-0313-45BD-B811-76067840D1A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A public concert of music by, or related to the work of, Hugh Davies, with a pre-concert talk beforehand. The purpose was to bring Davies's work to a wider public audience, and to perform works of Davies's that have seldom - if ever - been performed, adding a practical/musical dimension to this predominantly archive-based research. An in-person audience of around 100 was in attendance; in addition, regional, national, and international audience members were able to watch online via a live stream. The concert and talk were recorded, and have subsequently received 175 further views online (as of February 2016). A post-concert survey revealed that many audience members had been fascinated by the relationship between improvised and scored music. One audience member commented: &amp;quot;I had never seen people playing to a score in the context of improvisation.&amp;quot; Green's use of a cardboard box as a musical instrument also appears to have been a highlight. Another audience member remarked: &amp;quot;I'd never seen a cardboard box being used in a concert like that before. I especially liked it in the Stockhausen.&amp;quot; Almost 40% of audience members responding to the survey commented that this was not the kind of music that they would typically listen to. Gratifyingly, however, all of those audience members also said that they would consider attending a similar concert in the future. This suggests that the Hugh Davies Project might have a role to play in bringing experimental musics to a wider audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c30b9be335c8.96996530</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://hughdaviesproject.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/concert-review-23-may-2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Concert with Pre-Concert Talk - 18 October 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B2FC3A91-A916-4A15-8535-EE51727599BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A concert of works by Hugh Davies, rarely or never previously performed, whose scores and performance materials were reconstructed from archive sources as part of my research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6e1d0c5c690.60530654</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://hughdaviesproject.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/upcoming-concert-sounds-heard/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop: How to Share Digital/Multimedia Research Outputs and Data</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EAF60F1E-A0FA-4AB1-A021-404EFA0048EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>15 academics attended a workshop on 'How to Share Digital/Multimedia Research Outputs and Data'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6ef988d58d3.52802422</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts_intranet/info/125227/lhri_intranet/94/lhri_events_and_recordings</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>3x3 concert - Sheffield</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>582E1A26-83CA-4216-937A-A7F99E5D5F86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A public concert of electroacoustic music showcasing research and practice at the School of Music, University of Leeds.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6fa383e6a69.29752764</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://shef.ac.uk/usss/soundjunction/sjmay2017</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AHEM: First International Conference on Alternative Histories of Electronic Music</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4D4BD8FD-2685-4B55-9F44-609412A3F45E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an international conference held (and in partnership with) The Science Museum, London, focusing upon Alternative Histories of Electronic Music, that is, upon researching and accounting histories of electronic music in ways that differ from those most widely published.

Although the format of this event was that of an academic conference, because of the nature of the topic it naturally engaged a range of practitioners beyond normal 'academic circles', including freelance musicians/artists, museum curators, documentary film-makers, independent record label executives, and members of the general public. The conference itself also represented a significant engagement with a high profile third sector organisation, The Science Museum, elaborating the broader context of one of the Museum's key areas of interest over the next few years, 'Music and Science'. At the time of the present update (February 2016) the conference is still, in fact, in the planning stage, and hence specific impacts remain as yet unknown, though the event is already stimulating much interest and discussion; the call for participation, for example, appeared in the high-circulation avant-garde music magazine The Wire without specifically having been sent there.

Participants reported that the workshop changed the way they thought about musical performance and (in the case of composers) composition; they had not realised the range of sounds attainable with a tam-tam gong and microphone, that they had learned about the kind of electronic music equipment that was available in the 1960s. Several participants who were composers reported that their experiences at the workshop would influence their own compositional practice, while performers commented that the freer approach to musical performance explored in the workshop would be taken forward in their own performance.

1) Hugh Davies was the first person to document electronic music as a global, interdisciplinary activity, again, in the mid-1960s. (Prior to this, electronic music was generally thought to be confined to a relatively much smaller number of mainly Western European and North American countries, as an avant-garde art music activity.) The scale and scope of electronic music activity prior to 1975 has yet to be fully recognised / researched; the first international conference on 'Alternative Histories of Electronic Music', held at the Science Museum on 14-16 April 2016 as part of this project, represents a significant step towards addressing this, however.

2) Through his instrument-building activities, curatorial roles, and teaching, Hugh Davies was largely responsible for bringing a culture of live electronic music to Britain, in the mid-1960s. (Prior to this, electronic music in Britain was almost exclusively an off-stage, studio-bound activity, practiced in only a handful of private studios and - in an applied context - at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) Further research. The 'Alternative Histories of Electronic Music' conference at the Science Museum, and the resulting online video-proceedings and related special issue of the journal Organised Sound, provide the foundations for further research into under-explored areas of electronic music's history, including but certainly not limited to Davies's own work.

2) Development of live electronic music practice. My research into Davies's instrument-building practice has already started to influence performers, instrument builders, and artists whose interests lie in similar areas, leading to further research and practice in this area. One example is the residency with the French instrument-builder Anton Mobin, held as part of the project in March 2016.

3) Concerts, CDs, exhibitions, documentary films. The research will may be taken up by performers, curators, record label executives, and film makers with an interest in electronic music's history up to 1975, including but (partly thanks to the conference on 'Alternative Histories of Electronic Music') not limited to Hugh Davies's own work. The first concert outside of the project itself has already been arranged (for March 2016).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>008FB7FE-AAA0-4DA4-8812-6308EA289722</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6f141bb9430.15670939</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Electronics,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Report in Science Museum's Group's Research &amp;amp; Public History Annual Report for 2015-16</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DDE9F39-5B2F-4B91-A2F0-777E46DBA324</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b6f6b1eff262.44871104</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The British Library possesses an extensive collection of Hugh Davies's writings (mainly unpublished), research notes, and other documentation, which currently (March 2016) is uncatalogued.
