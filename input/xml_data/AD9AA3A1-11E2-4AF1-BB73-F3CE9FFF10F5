It contains within its DNA sequence all the information required to define not only cell type, but also the ability to respond to a variety of external conditions and signals. For example, the genome of the simple eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains 12 million base-pairs of DNA split into 16 separate chromosomes and comprises some 6,000 different genes. The protein products of these genes rarely act individually, and whole pathways are often regulated in response to a particular signal. Indeed, the complex processes of the cell depend on differential expression of sets of genes either in particular cell types (e.g., when cell differentiation takes place within an embryo), at a particular time (e.g., when a microbe produces an antibiotic late in its growth cycle), or under certain environmental conditions (e.g., changes in the metabolic flux within a cell depending upon metabolite availability). Thus within cells there are programmes whereby sets of genes can be co-ordinately switched on or off. Efficient switches, must be able to operate in two directions: on to off and off to on. Genetic switches must operate in this way also, for example allowing appropriate gene expression when the certain nutrients are available, and turning gene expression off when nutrients are limiting or are unavailable. Insights into these processes can be gained by studying the relatively simple genetic switches of yeast (although the mechanistic details have turned out to be frighteningly complex!). Yeasts share a large number of similarities with human and other animal cells. The process of reading the information contained within a gene (transcription) is very similar between yeast and human cells. Indeed, many human transcription factors are able to functionally complement their yeast homologues. Yeast cells regulate many sets of genes in response to external signals. For example, yeasts grown on a variety of carbon sources do not express the enzymes for the degradation of galactose. However, when galactose is the sole carbon source available, the cell rapidly expresses large amounts of the galactose degradation enzymes. The galactose genetic switch involves at least three players; an activator (responsible for turning the genes on), a repressor (inhibits the activator), and an inducer that modulates the interaction of the activator and the repressor. The interplay between these three protein components is mediated by two small molecules / a sugar and a source of energy (galactose and ATP). The galactose switch (GAL switch) has been studied for many years using a combination of classical yeast genetic techniques and biochemical approaches. These methods have, however, generated conflicting results concerning the mechanism of gene activation in response to galactose. The work proposed here will resolve these conflicts by solving the three dimensional structures of each of the GAL regulatory proteins (both alone and in complex with each other). Combined, these data will elucidate the mechanism of action of this important genetic switch.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>To survive and flourish an organism must tightly regulate the expression of sets of genes. To ensure proper timing and levels of gene expression, elaborate, and often overlapping, mechanisms exist within cells to detect changes in internal and external environmental conditions (e.g., levels of metabolites, the presence of a hormone, etc.) and convert the detection of a signal into a transcriptional response so that the produced proteins can mount a response to that particular signal. In eukaryotes, one of the most intensively studied transcriptional control system is that if the yeast GAL genes. This set of genes are only expressed when the cells are grown on the sugar galactose as the sole source of carbon. The expression of the GAL genes is regulated by three proteins / a transcriptional activator (Gal4p), a repressor (Gal80p) and an inducer (Gal3p). A physical association between Gal4p and Gal80p inhibits the transcriptional activation function of Gal4p. Induction of gene expression occurs when galactose and ATP bind to Gal3p and this protein-metabolite complex interacts with Gal80p. We have recently solved the structure of Gal80p at 2.1&amp;Aring; resolution, and have obtained crystals of Gal80p in complex with a peptide representing the acidic activation domain of Gal4p. Here, we will continue our high-resolution structural analysis of the GAL regulatory proteins to determine the precise chemical environments that exists between the three proteins. Taken together, the information generated through this project will shed new light on this important, but still comparatively poorly understood, regulatory system. The GAL system is often used as a textbook example of the control of gene expression in eukaryotes. It is time, therefore, to elucidate its mechanism more fully so that a clear and unambiguous picture of its method of regulation may be drawn.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>374638</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In response to be challenged with altered nutrient availability, the model eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) is capable of changing the expression patterns of sets of genes as part of an adaptive survival strategy. For gene expression changes to occur, the cell must have mechanisms to be able recognise that nutrient availability has altered and be capable to conveying this recognition to the transcriptional machinery. This award has concentrated on the mechanisms by which yeast cells respond to changes in the availability of the sugar galactose. Galactose, a monosaccharide epimer of glucose, is metabolically less favourable in comparison to glucose. The genes encoding the enzymes of the Leloir pathway, which are required for galactose metabolism, are induced several thousand fold when the cells are grown on media in which galactose is the sole source of carbon. The process of galactose recognition and signal transduction replies on three proteins. Galactose is recognised in yeast by a ligand sensor, Gal3p. The presence of galactose and ATP promotes an interaction between the ligand sensor and a transcriptional inhibitor, Gal80p. The main role of Gal80p is to modulate the activity of the RNA polymerase II transcription factor, Gal4p which can be found tethered upstream of the genes encoding the Leloir pathway enzymes (the GAL genes). The galactose-dependent interaction between Gal3p and Gal80p allows Gal4p to activate gene expression.

During the course of this award we solved the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of a complex between Gal80p and the activation domain of Gal4p. This work has generated an unparalleled level of detail regarding the molecular basis of transcriptional inhibition. In addition, we developed a novel screening method to uncover the precise interactions between Gal4p and Gal80p in an in vivo setting. The method developed to identify these interactions could be applied to numerous other protein-protein interactions where one of the partner proteins is a transcriptional activator. We have also identified the structural changes that occur within Gal1p upon ligand binding. This has generated a greater understanding of the changes in the ligand sensor that occur to allow its interaction with Gal80p. Finally, using a novel and powerful method for localising active transcription factors within the nucleus of cells, we have discovered, we believe conclusively, a unifying model for GAL gene induction that draws together a wide range of apparently contradictory work. Specifically, we have shown that a short-lived complex between Gal4p, Gal80p and Gal3p occurs soon (5-10 min) after the addition of galactose to cells to activate GAL gene expression. Gal3p is subsequently replaced in this complex by Gal1p, and a Gal4p-Gal80p-Gal1p complex is responsible for the continued expression of the GAL genes. The transient role of the ligand sensor indicates that current models for the induction and continued expression of the yeast GAL genes need to be re-evaluated.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2005</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4D3173D8-B0F8-4ACD-B035-F840403C187C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>54652bd2c00d67.93390310</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In response to be challenged with altered nutrient availability, the model eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) is capable of changing the expression patterns of sets of genes as part of an adaptive survival strategy.

Mutagenesis and high-resolution structural work have shed new light on the molecular interactions between Gal4p and Gal80p. A low-resolution picture of the interaction between Gal80p and the ligand sensor has been generated and the interactions occurring between Gal4p and Gal80p and between Gal80p and Gal3p have been analysed in vivo. Through the course of this work, we have generated a novel, and testable, model for the molecular basis of GAL gene induction.
