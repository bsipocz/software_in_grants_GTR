 Many mobile commerce (mCommerce) solutions just focus on individual services or how users pay for services. In doing so, they miss out on a vital preliminary step; the secure discovery of trusted services. For example, in their normal day-to-day lives, users of all types and capabilities need to easily find the services that are relevant to their needs in a way that they can trust.
 TagBuddy allows tags to be placed on objects and then be securely accessed using a mobile phone, providing trusted information and service discovery that is context, location, user and device aware. The tags are ideally Radio Frequency Identifiers (RFID) accessed via Near Field Communication (NFC*) phones, however TagBuddy also supports a transitional mode based on camera reading of two-dimensional bar codes (QR-codes). The deployed solution consists primarily of the tags attached to objects, an application downloaded to the user's smart phone and a back-end server. Existing tag/mobile solutions have been shown to be vulnerable to modification, misuse and fraud; misdirecting users to adult and gambling sites, to criminal premium rate services, or to fake phishing sites. However, TagBuddy has an effective security solution based on the tags, phone and back-office, which is transparent to the user. TagBuddy should come to represent a trusted and most simple/intuitive way for accessing services, and in particular those that are accessible via the phone browser after direction to a service provider URL. The service provider, service and/or information that are discovered based on tag access, are dynamically chosen and so the result is analogous to a Google search triggered by the tag access. The result should match the general context of the request, however, the offered service and service provider may also be based on business criteria, permitting a model where service providers pay a fee for preferential selection. Furthermore, the way in which the service is presented to the user by the service provider can be fully customised in terms of language, symbols, audio and suitability for the user's phone device, using information gathered during the tag access.
 The Phase 1 project is to take an existing functional solution from Crisp Telecom Limited (that is being used for another purpose), integrate the identified security measures (to combat security attacks and fraud), add support for an additional smart phone OS (to show multi-platform inclusivity), incorporate a dynamic service selection engine (to enable the business model) and carry out a small trial demonstrating multi-lingual/symbol and audio/visual service presentation (to show user inclusivity). The primary goal is too fully demonstrate the secure product capability so that a commercial partner/licensee will be found to drive the product towards its full potential.
 *NFC is a short range (few cm) wireless interface technology that allows mobile phones to emulate contactless smart cards and RFIDs, or to behave as the reader/writer devices for accessing contactless smart cards and RFIDs. There is also a peer-to-peer mode that enables two phones to communicate when in very close proximity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49980</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971319</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
