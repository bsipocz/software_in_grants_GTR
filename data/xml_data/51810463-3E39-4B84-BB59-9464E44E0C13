Only in the last few years has it started to attract attention from museum curators and academics in Japan and in the West. The focus of this research network is sculpture made in Japan after the Meiji restoration of 1868, when the country was opened officially to Western influence for the first time in two centuries. The following decades saw the collision and fusion of two very different artistic cultures, as foreign artists were invited into Japan, Japanese artists travelled to the West and the first Western-style art academies were founded in Tokyo. Before the Meiji period, there was no word for 'sculpture' in Japanese and no concept of sculpture as an independent art form, distinct from craft practice. However, there were rich traditions of object making both for religious and secular purposes and of carving in wood, bone and ivory. 

In the Meiji period (1868-1912) Japanese artists with a background in traditional object-making experimented with Western techniques, aesthetics and forms, including modelling in clay, working directly from the life model, anatomical realism, portraiture and figure sculpture. By the following Taisho and Showa periods (1912-c.1937), a younger generation of sculptors were able to draw upon a variety of different sources, revisiting traditional craft practices and applying Western techniques to non-Western forms and aesthetics, to create hybrid objects, hovering between the different artistic traditions. This was an avant-garde that used skill and tradition to develop sculptural thinking in new ways.

Given the current lack of knowledge in Europe of Japanese sculpture of this period, the research network will use the exhibitions A Study of Modern Japanese Sculpture, at the Henry Moore Institute and a further exhibition at Musashino Art Museum as the focus and starting point for a series of three research workshops: at the Henry Moore Institute; Musashino University and the Slade School of Fine Art, UCL, which will bring together scholars from Japan and the UK and promote international discussion around a subject which itself embodies cross-cultural exchange. 

The intention with the Modern Japanese Sculpture Network is to open debates on an under-researched topic, sharing ideas between Japan and the UK and developing opportunities for future collaborations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research of the Modern Japanese Sculpture Research Network is designed to be of wide reaching impact beyond academia. It aims to involve, connect and work with a range of individuals and institutions. It is intended that the outcomes of the network will be disseminated in a wide range of forms having a lasting impact on many users. 

Beneficiaries of the network beyond the academic research community will include: 

Museums &amp;amp; Galleries, Arts, Culture &amp;amp; Heritage
Through its inclusion, involvement and knowledge sharing with Museums &amp;amp; Galleries, Arts, Culture &amp;amp; Heritage institutions across the UK and Japan, the network will promote and foster growing knowledge of Modern Japanese Sculpture and is intended to lead to further exhibitions, seminars and conferences on the subject - introducing and involving a range of museum individuals, curatorial departments and audiences to the sculptural work of this period in Japan, previously unseen in the UK. Henry Moore Institute (HMI), and Musashino Art University (MAU) have already committed to the network, while the Ashmolean Museum, The Sainsbury Centre for the Study of Japanese Art and Cultures, British Museum, V&amp;amp;A, Museum Of Modern Art, Tokyo, The Hirgausa Denshu Museum, Tokyo, The Asakura Fumio Chosu Kan, the Migei Kan among others have expressed serious interest. 

Creative Practitioners
The sculptural techniques used in Modern Japanese Sculpture are a unique fusion of traditional Japanese craft and Western forms of making, previously unstudied. The network's object based study will reveal these novel making methods introducing them to UK and Japanese creative practitioners, widening their practice and vocabulary.

The Wider Public
The exhibitions at HMI and MAU organized by the network will bring important works of art to the wider public for the first time. Accompanying both exhibitions are the proposed conferences and workshops, which the wider public will be able to attend. All participating institutions will be disseminating information online and through social media platforms.

Libraries and Archives
Libraries and archivists will be invited and introduced to the network. It is hoped this will lead to further collaborations within the UK and internationally with the potential for further events to be held, outreach projects to be established and outcomes of the network to be housed within such institutions in future. 

The UK and Japan Government
UCL is in a special position to connect government in Japan and the UK and to positively affect international relations. As a non-religious and liberal arts university the first Japanese students ever to visit the UK, The Choso Five, visited UCL in 1865, one of them, Hirobumi Ito, became the first Japanese Prime Minister. In 2014 the current Japanese Prime Minister Abe visited UCL. UCL is also part of a joint UK /Japanese university association called RENKEI (Research and Education Network for Knowledge Economy Initiatives). Renkei is the Japanese word for collaboration. 

Japanese Community in the UK and vice versa
The network, its exhibitions and research is based on cultural exchange and understanding the close cultural connections between the West and Japan in modern art. It is hoped that its outcomes will impact community relations, develop public awareness, attitudes, debates and understanding. 

Commemoration and reconciliation
One of the reasons for the neglect of the study of this subject, both within Japan and outside, is what in Japan is known as the Pacific War (World War II). This is still contentious within Japan and diplomatically sensitive. The aim of the network will be to neutrally develop a UK/Japanese methodology to examine sculptural works of this period in relation to Western interaction and develop new ways of both preserving them and understanding them, and by doing so also impact public awareness, attitudes, debate, and encourage reconciliation regarding this period in history.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36037</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'A Study of Modern Japanese Sculpture' was the first exhibition to show Japanese sculptures of the Meiji period (1868-1912) in UK, featuring works by Tetsuya Mizunoya (1876-1943) and Risaburo Miyamoto (1904-98), as well as the master sculptors Kotaro Takamura (1883-1956), Heihachi Hashimoto (1897-1935) and Chozan Sato (1888-1963). The exhibition was first held at the Henry Moore Institute (28 January - 19 April 2015) then travelled back to Japan, the Musashino Art University Museum &amp;amp; Library, Kodaira,Tokyo (25 May - 16 August 2015). It was curated by Sophie Raikes of the Henry Moore Institute in partnership with Edward Allington of the Slade School of Fine Art, UCL and with Musashino Art University Museum &amp;amp; Library, and supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council as well as the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation, Japan Foundation and Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation.

The selection of works by these five artists focuses on sculptural representation of nature, including polychrome carvings of dried fish, birds, a crustacean and a hibernating toad; a stone carved in wood; and a hand modelled in clay and cast in bronze. These sculptures celebrate small things and fragments, treating inanimate objects, living creatures and human subjects in much the same way. All starts with Western concepts of realism, but pose questions for Western sculpture in terms of their subject matter, scale, colour, support and approach to materials. The term 'modern Japanese sculpture' refers to sculpture made in Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 - a period when sculptors turned their attention to western sculptural practices. Limited research has been conducted into this area and the title of the exhibition reflects its intention to initiate further studies and new discussion around the subject. We aimed to share ideas between Japan and the UK and develop opportunities for future collaborations through an exhibition as an object-based research methodology.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2DD9F266-883E-45D2-9447-5B6BFCB86B3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition at the Henry Moore Institute attracted a lot of interest and more visitors than usual (total number of visitors: 3021). Staff that were invigilating the space reported that visitors responded with surprise and delight with a real desire to know more about it. At the time of the opening, the joint publication was not yet available, because it came out after the one-day seminar. The research and discussions were so new that we had to wait, and a lot of people were disappointed that there was no text in English relating to the subject matter. There was certainly a thirst for the knowledge, which tells a strong impact on general public. 
The exhibition at the Musashino Art University Museum &amp;amp; Library attracted a lot of visitors (total number of visitors: 7593) ranging from general public to university students, artists and scholars. The visitors were particularly inspired by the selection of works from the Western point of view which triggered active discussions at the two-days symposium on the topic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589df06429a897.70943483</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>'A Study of Modern Japanese Sculpture'</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.henry-moore.org/whats-on/2015/01/28/a-study-of-modern-japanese-sculpture</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Musashino Art University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:description>Modern Japanese Sculpture Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>09BF2FBF-AD4A-4A7F-A2C2-3085A83A0A67</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1) Publications

It was a rare opportunity for academics from Japan and the West to share research into Japanese sculpture. Continuing the discussion from the one-day seminar at the Henry Moore Institute, the event aimed to establish modern Japanese sculpture as an academic discipline in Western academia and beyond. The speakers ranged from art historians, art critics and curators to conservators and sculptors from Japan, Korea, France and UK. Each presentation nurtured the conference's aim to carve out the significance of modern Japanese sculpture in the history of art from the Meiji period onwards, in order to explore the complex process of modernisation in Japan and examine the historical context of craftworks and Buddhist sculpture. The essential argument revolved around the definition of the notions of 'modern', 'Japanese', 'sculpture' and 'art'. These notions were not clearly articulated until the Meiji Restoration of 1868, when numerous terms were invented. This was driven by an imperative to construct the modern Japanese state as a powerful, independent country, with a strong social, technological and cultural tradition equal with Western countries. The issue of terminology generated an active discussion into the nature of sculpture, illuminating the continuing tensions between art and power, arts and crafts, tradition and innovation, preservation and creation, medium and representation, technique and existential passion, as well as the cultural process of self-identification. The conference certainly marked an exciting moment when a new subject was being moulded into a discipline.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589dd0be793537.92543513</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://mauml.musabi.ac.jp/museum/archives/8977</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interchange meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>69D107B6-3577-41D0-91E8-54ADD0D38937</gtr:id><gtr:impact>15 sculpture students from the Musashino Art University, Japan visited at the Slade School of Fine Art on 9th March, 2016 as part of an interchange meeting between the Musashino Art University and the Slade School of Fine Art.

With the support of major institutions in the UK and Japan, the Research Network has built awareness of the subject - opening and developing a discourse on transnational aesthetic and culture. The project presented huge challenges, as this is a new subject area in Japanese sculpture in the UK, and an emerging subject in Japan. Particularly we have worked hard on building up connections to major scholars in Japan and the UK, visits to collections, and the selection of works for exhibition. 
The Research Network facilitated the first ever exhibition of Modern Japanese Sculpture in the UK - based at The Henry Moore Institute. The exhibition was open to the public and showcased original artwork transported from Japan. The Research Network also facilitated the exhibition at the Musashino Art University which the Japanese Government designated as a major cultural event. We made the very first publication on the subject both hard copy and digital in English and Japanese in circulation. Through open discussions at workshops and lectures associated with the exhibition, the Research Network demonstrated an active engagement with scholars, major museums, students and the public in both countries.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>80E856EC-CA63-4D72-A5B5-DD8CB0C968BD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df0a1364ff96.67531248</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research project has opened up completely new avenues of Sculpture studies both in Japan and the UK. A very extensive research network has been established in both countries, including major Museums, Universities and private collectors. It brought scholars, practicing artists, and museum curators from the UK and Japan into a unique cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural network for the first time with the aim of developing new working methods for the understanding of sculpture and the development of non-Western sculpture. 
In terms of objectives, we met all the objectives that we initially planned. We have established the modern Japanese sculpture Research Network as the basis for ongoing collaborative research through various research activities. Two very significant and ground-breaking exhibitions were held at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds and the Mushashino Art Museum in Tokyo. Both were well attended by students and the general public and the exhibition in Tokyo received TV coverage. We have hosted two workshops in UK and one two-day international symposium in Japan centred on the exhibitions of primary visual research material at the Henry Moore Institute and the Musashino Art University Museum and Library. We have published a bilingual English/Japanese journal on modern Japanese sculpture (Sophie Raikes and others, 'A Study of Modern Japanese Sculpture: Essays on Sculpture 72', Henry Moore Institute, 2015), the first such bilingual publication on the subject.
Through these outputs, we have developed a new level of scholarship in Japanese Studies with practicing artists, curators and academics both in the UK and Japan, developed cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural exchange, developed existing contacts in Japan and the UK and also established new contacts within the field.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Exhibitions, the publications in both languages, the workshops by major Japanese scholars and practitioners have facilitated new research awareness by scholars and amateur enthusiasts. The Research Network is still active. The next stage is to develop the project using the network and expand the historical period of the research, for instance, the period from the late Edo period (1850s) to the end of Showa (1989). This will be able to more broadly illuminate the process of modernisation and Westernisation in Japanese sculpture. There are plans for a special edition of The Sculpture Journal, the only peer reviewed journal on sculpture in the UK, to feature the topic of modern Japanese sculpture. In addition, there are plans for a publication of Japanese Modern Sculpture Reader (in joint languages) and a book to introduce the subject to a general audience in English. The discussion about a further exhibition is going on between the original collaborators, the Slade School of Fine Art, UCL, the Mushashino Art University and the Henry Moore Institute. This research project is expected to foster a new generation of scholars among PhD students and post-doctoral researchers as well as existing academics and curators in the UK and Japan to develop the subject, and make it available to wider audiences.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AF666D44-A069-45F1-9F9D-2376FA6C23F5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e18984af2592.55130737</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8663A65F-0658-4FE5-BF44-087DD138AA3D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Record of International Symposium 'A Study of Modern Japanese Sculpture' Dual-language Version</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4e3067b12a4efdc5e1513813d8fd5dc9"><gtr:id>4e3067b12a4efdc5e1513813d8fd5dc9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kurokawa H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589dbb1884e312.75848052</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>349A0666-A7B1-47CF-9B41-D7EFBC1D7BCB</gtr:id><gtr:title>A study of Modern Japanese Sculpture: Henry Moore Institute Essays on Sculpture 72</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3d69392195e8dc0b5fa9ce636d1db258"><gtr:id>3d69392195e8dc0b5fa9ce636d1db258</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buckland R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-905462-48-3</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58caa428039960.11937999</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M008312/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
