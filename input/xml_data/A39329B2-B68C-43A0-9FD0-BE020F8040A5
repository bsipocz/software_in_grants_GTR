QCD is one of the components of the so-called Standard Model that is used to explain the dynamics of elementary particles. Understanding QCD is therefore of paramount importance in order to be able to verify our current understanding of Nature at the smallest distance scales explored so far, and eventually discover new physics. A major obstacle in this quest, is the complicated dynamics which characterises QCD. One possible solution is the study of QCD by intensive e simulations on powerful computers. Within this approach, one of the main difficulties is to obtain reliable results when the mass of the matter particles in the numerical simulations becomes a slight as it is in the real world. The first aim of my research is therefore to develop the algorithmic tools, i.e. the computer programs, needed for this task. They represent the fundamental tools in order to obtain quantitative predictions from the theory. The recent progresses in the computer industry have made available an unprecedented computing power. Combined with the most advanced programming techniques, even ordinary PCs can now perform up to two or three million of operations per second. Using dedicated machines, sometimes built out of thousands of PCs, the numerical approach to QCD can deliver answers that have a real impact on our description of the physical phenomena seen at particle accelerators. The application of numerical methods to QCD can serve several purposes. The first application of these techniques is the computation of the fundamental parameters of QCD. With these parameters, one can compute predictions for a wide variety of processes, that are actually observed at particle accelerators. The constant comparison of theoretical predictions to experimental data will ultimately confirm the success of QCD a the theory of strong interactions. On the other hand, discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results will provide the handles for theoretical physicists that are looking beyond the Standard Model for hints of new phenomena. This is called a phenomenological application, since it is directly aimed to the determination of description of experimental data. Physics always tries to explain the dynamics of complicated systems in terms of interactions of elementary constituents. Hence the ordinary matter that we observe in everyday's life is described in terms of atoms. The atoms themselves are made of smaller constituents, called nucleons and electrons. While the electrons seem to be truly elementary particles, at least within our current knowledge, physicists have understood since a long time that the nucleons are bound states of elementary constituents called partons, that interact via the strong force. Another objective of my research is to obtain a description of the structure of nucleons in terms of partons, using an innovative numerical technique to process the relevant experimental data. Once it is known, the structure of the nucleons becomes an important input for the analysis of further experiments. There are also more theoretical issues that one can consider. An alternative description of the strong forced is based on the idea that the most elementary building blocks of Nature are not point-particles but infinitesimally small strings. This beautiful idea has far-reaching consequences both in mathematics and in physics, and it has often been advocated as a candidate 'Theory of Everything', namely a single theory that is capable to describe all the fundamental forces in Nature. Another application of the numerical techniques is the computation of QCD predictions in a regime where it is actually possible to compare the results with those coming from String Theory. In this way one can check the conjectures that relate String Theory to QCD.
