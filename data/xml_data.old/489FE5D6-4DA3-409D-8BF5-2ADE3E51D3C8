&lt;p>The results of the survey&amp;nbsp; will be able to plug important evidentiary gaps about the recourse to patenting by innovative firms and also the use of patents though licensing and cross-licensing in the UK economy. In addition detailed interviews&amp;nbsp; of&amp;nbsp; IP management practices in UK firms based on similar surveys conducted in the US will enable a deeper understanding of the organisational issues and practices regarding IP valorisation in&amp;nbsp; UK firms. We expect that this understanding and analysis of the survey data will be a valuable input in training programmes to raise awareness about patent use in small and medium firms and can also inform policy on intellectual property in the UK and the UK?s position on patent use legislation at the EU-level.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a knowledge exchange programme where we scope out, with the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) as partner, the possibility of deepening understanding of how IP is managed in UK businesses. This would use two short surveys significantly based on academic ideas that have underpinned such inquiries in the US and Japan. There are a number of non-academic communities that are active in the areas of patents and other aspects of IP, who could benefit from a fuller knowledge of academic research methods and research findings. These include users in the public domain such as the the IPO itself and also the Office of National Statistics and the Department of Business Innovation and Skills and also non-academic users such as the IP community of lawyers and small businesses. 
The choice of UK IPO as the partner is crucial to securing a broad impact for this proposal. We say this because reaching the findings of our enquiry to the wider audience of businesses and IP lawyers can be better achieved if we can input into the IPO's business support and awareness activities to make our findings accessible to these different users. These include inputting the findings of the joint research into their regular newsletter IP Insight and their business support programme. 
In addition we will also produce a policy briefing document which will be presented at a joint IPO-Brunel organised conference. We will include the managerial implications of our research into on-going training and awareness programmes which are conducted on a regular basis by the UK IPO. We will also consider the scope for incorporating the lessons on IP management into the national and international management standards frameworks such as ISO 9001, initially through consultation with BSI and UKAS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68073</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with BIS, Statistics directorate</gtr:description><gtr:id>416BBEF9-A640-4FAF-ACAD-3C4A8DAA410C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration will result in useful data that can be analysed by the Economic Research and Evidence wing of the IPO.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461fa2bba4ff1.12996176-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>They assessed our request and accepted inclusion of two questions.

For other researchers, the highlight of our work was the innovativeness in the collaborative methodlogy used by the project- which involved the UK IPO, ONS and the researchers. The collaboration of all three parties helped us realise a good datset with an over 60% response rate which compared favourably to the between 10-30% achieved in other research projects that had spent larger resources on collecting their data.
For policy makers and practioners the highlight of the work was the estimates of the size of the licensing market which we presented in the talk.

After the talk there was interest in contributing to the special issue of the journal Research Policy being edited by Professor Arora and myself on the topic of Patent Use. there was also interest in talking with the ERE about more collabortaive projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460d2d06d26b0.93752084</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ukirc.ac.uk/archive/events-archive/profiting-from-service-innovation/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference on Patent Use</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3AA7A8F-4CFC-4B47-8337-FD982291FEBD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the end of project workshop organised together with the UK IPO and hosted at the Big Innovation Centre. Over 80 delegates attended the workshop - mostly from policy maker and legal practioner communities. The workshop contained six presentations which tried to benchmark the project's findings on patent use in the UK with what we know about the same for Europe, USA, Japan and Australia. We were successful in acheiving the following during the meeting:
(i) An assessment that our results were broadly in line with international findings- closer to US averages than Europe.
(ii) A honest exchange between academics and members of the legal community on the ethics of collecting data on licensing from inventors ( the favoured approach in the past but not ours)
(iii) A useful discussion of policy mechnaims that could eb put into place for acheiving greater Patent use in the UK and European economy.

We felt a major impact of the workshop was getting more acceptance from the legal community about the importance of data on mamagement on IP. The Intellectual Property awareness Network asked if they could publicise the findings as did the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys. The IPO also agreed to make anon-technical account of the workshop available on their website.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460d81a393ea9.71387220</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ipo.gov.uk/blogs/ipofacto/tag/patent-survey/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New research reveals value of patenting and technology licensing to UK firms</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>755123B8-C208-446C-8491-972E2279D81C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the text of Brunel University's press release publicizing the findings.

In order to probe the role of MNE and other group companies and also to understand the characteristics of a firm's most valuable innovation, the IPO expects to commission a telephone interview based almost entirely on Section B and C of our developed questionnaire.

Based on analysis of the Survey of Innovation and Patent Use (SIPU), led by Brunel 
University, commissioned by the Intellectual Property Office (IPO), and implemented by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), we show that whilst only 3% of all firms 
take advantage of patenting, when looking at those firms which innovate this number rises to 40%. The research shows that the size of the organization does not influence the likelihood of patenting; rather the strongest factor that determines whether a business is likely to patent is the ability to create novel innovations and volume of R&amp;amp;D undertaken. 
Another key finding of the research is that firms are relying more often on technology licensing (underpinned by patents) to keep up with the market especially when innovation is limited by constraints on resources. Between 2009-2012 the study estimated that expenditure on technology in-licensing was around &amp;pound;6.9 billion a year in the UK. This equates to almost 40% of the total business enterprise spending on 
R&amp;amp;D, and over 3% of gross investment in the UK. Industries where innovation rates 
are low were most likely to use technology licensing in a bid to keep up with the market. In contrast, industries with high rates of innovation were less likely to use licensing possibly due to the desire to maintain exclusivity and avoid having to share a technology with competitors. We also studied open innovation practices and their relationship to patent propensity distinguishing between technology leaders and technology followers. We found technology leaders who were open innovators tended to patent more than technology followers. patenting is thus salient even when developing products through open innovation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our analysis has important implications for patent policies. First, it points to the need to distinguish between patenting and the proportion of innovations patented. Large firms have more patents because they have more innovations but truly innovative small firms can also benefit from patenting. With our partner the UK IPO we have made this point to the Statistics department of the BIS who have accordingly amended the wording of questions in the CIS 2015. Second, our more recent analysis points to the link between the type of innovator and patent propensity. Technology leaders need to be treated differently when compared to technology followers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>29B09876-A25B-4BA4-8292-DBA8D6BCBC27</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461ef3f2c5019.94316176</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Creation of a new database on barriers to patent and trademark use in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BBE8A5D8-755F-4B54-A621-6061AFD563D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In the project we developed a new survey methodology which would place small and large firms on an equal footing and use the existing Community Innovation survey database. Using this methodology the UK IPO developed a database to understand the barriers to formal intellectual property usage. The PI designed the new survey and worked with the ONS to implement it. After the UK CIS2015 was released, the PI signed a MoU with the UK IPO to analyse the data on the barriers to patent and trademark use. The analysis revealed that four assumptions that often underlie thinking about patent policy were incorrect. First, we didn't find any evidence when looking at a single innovation that small firms were less likely to use patents than large firms. Second, we find that disclosure of information, modelled by many theoretical papers as the most common barrier to patenting, was in fact a barrier to patent use for very few innovating firms but patentability was an important issue. More research needs to be done to understand what patentability really means. Third, we found that while open firms do patent and trademark less than other types of firms, openness was a larger barrier to the use of trademarks than patents, suggesting that market sharing is more problematic when compared to technology sharing. Fourth, although there is a large and growing literature suggesting trademarking and patenting are linked, we found very little evidence of a one-to-one correspondence between innovations and trademarks -- firms might introduce new products and still use (extend) their old trademarks to cover these newer products.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8bff0c4a1e3.18814256</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>member of the Research Board, Big Innovation Centre</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F0A59BB-4E3B-48EE-A55A-3547AC794AE9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c8c17ed76a81.01636333</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Estimating the value of technology licensing in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8695164B-3A3B-47F9-9288-DBCED1EFCB0B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An important social benefit of patents is the circulation of knowledge in the economy through technology licensing.
