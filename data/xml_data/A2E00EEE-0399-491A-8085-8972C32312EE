Ideally, it requires a large experiment including hundreds, or even thousands, of patients. To make sure only treatments which have a good chance of being found to have a beneficial effect undergo these expensive experiments, smaller 'exploratory' experiments are often carried out first, giving an initial indication of whether the treatment is worth studying further.

When the treatment is a drug, these exploratory experiments are common, but not all treatments are drugs. One example would be a psychotherapy treatment delivered by a psychologist for patients suffering depression. Another example might be a support group like alcoholics anonymous. Other non-drug treatments (known as 'complex interventions') can include surgery, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy or nursing. It is generally more difficult to test these complex interventions than drugs. This is partly because we are often interested in a number of ways in which the treatment affects patients, as opposed to focussing on a single measure. Another complication comes from it being difficult to work out what is having the effect - the treatment itself, or the person delivering the treatment. 

When designing exploratory experiments to examine complex interventions, a fundamental decision is how many patients and care providers to study. This is important because it will determine how confident researchers can be in the results of the experiment. The larger the experiment, the less likely that we will observe an extreme effect of the treatment by chance alone. However, we also want to keep experiments as small as possible to minimise the cost and participant's time. Statisticians therefore need to work out the smallest number of participants which will give the research community enough confidence in the results to allow research funders to make reliable decisions about which treatments to take on to large, expensive experiments. However, methods for doing this for exploratory experiments of complex interventions have yet to be developed.

In this project I will develop these methods, enabling researchers to properly design exploratory experiments testing complex interventions in a reliable and efficient way. I will develop several variants of the methods so that they can be applied in a range of situations. I will start by extending existing methods used within drug development, focusing on keeping the chance of making an incorrect decision (e.g. taking an ineffective treatment on to a large expensive experiment) low. After this, I will consider ways to use existing information about the treatment, such as how much we expect its effect to vary among the population, which will help minimise the number of participants needed. Finally, I will develop methods that explicitly consider the consequences of decisions, leading to experiments which better reflect the priorities of all interested parties.

All of these approaches will be computer intensive. To help others use them, I will also spend time writing user-friendly and efficient computer software which allows them to be used quickly and easily and will apply the methods to real examples of trial design problems. This will involve working with clinicians and other statisticians, and will help to make sure that the methods developed are easy to apply and will be used in practice.

Developing these methods will improve the process of developing and testing complex interventions. They will ensure that the limited resources available for running large clinical trials (including research funds and participant time) are spent wisely on the treatments which show the most promise. In turn, this will increase the rate at which new interventions are identified and made available, improving the standard of care for patients across the breadth of the NHS.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aim: This work aims to develop, implement and disseminate methods to design and analyse early trials for assessing potential efficacy of complex interventions, addressing cases with several endpoints of varying importance, and multilevel data structures.

Research plan: 1a) Assuming all parameters other than the treatment effect are known, I will develop a hypothesis testing approach to designing an early phase complex intervention trial, building on existing phase II drug trial designs and sample size determination methods. 1b) I will develop an alternative Bayesian approach, allowing uncertainty in parameters to be specified through prior probability distributions. 1c) I will extend this to a fully decision-theoretic framework, enabling acceptable trade-offs between the various endpoints of interest to be specified. 1d) I will develop and apply all methods using several illustrative examples. These applications will involve discussions with clinicians and trial statisticians, providing opportunities to establish their acceptability and feasibility. 2) I will implement the methods in R and Stata, using efficient optimisation algorithms and a user-friendly interface. 3) I will develop documentation of the software and associated tutorial materials to provide online.

Impact: Proper implementation of the methods developed in this research will ensure that only complex interventions of sufficient promise proceed to evaluation in a confirmatory trial. By ensuring that only the most promising interventions reach this stage, the rate at which new interventions are made available to patients will increase. This amounts to a more efficient use of the limited resources available for evaluating new interventions, reducing the amount of research funds, research time and participant time spent on unnecessary phase III trials of ineffective interventions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>When funders consider the case for a confirmatory trial of a complex intervention, the evidence base available to inform this decision is often incomplete. The methods provided by this proposed research will enable the evidence base to be strengthened by providing a way to generate and analyse high quality experimental data on the potential efficacy of the complex interventions. This will be of direct benefit to funders of clinical research evaluating complex interventions, including the NIHR, allowing them to make better decisions regarding the distribution of their limited resources. These benefits will begin to accrue over the course of the fellowship, as collaborative relationships with clinical researchers lead to proposals for clinical trials employing the proposed methods in their design. It is anticipated that this research will begin to impact grant applications immediately following completion of the fellowship. Beyond the fellowship, as dissemination activities continue to impact research practice by encouraging more comprehensive early phase trials of complex interventions, these benefits will continue to accrue.

This research will also be of benefit to the wider public, indirectly improving their health and wellbeing. With no formal methods for assessing the potential efficacy of complex interventions at an early stage currently available, opportunities to identify ineffective interventions at an early stage are being missed. As a result, more ineffective interventions than necessary are being evaluated on a large scale through a confirmatory trial. By consuming valuable resources in the process, including research funds and participant time, these trials effectively delay or entirely prevent trials of other effective interventions. This research will lead to a more efficient process of complex intervention evaluation, allowing ineffective interventions to be identified early on, either to be discarded or adapted and refined for re-evaluation. This will lead to an increased rate at which confirmatory trials conclude that the proposed intervention is effective, and consequently an increased rate at which new treatments which improve health and wellbeing are made available to the public. Moreover, as indirect funders of complex intervention evaluation through the NIHR, the public will benefit economically from these increases in efficiency. Given the broad range of health areas in which complex interventions are being developed and evaluated, the potential benefit to the public is considerable. It is expected that the results of this research will impact patients after approximately 7 years from the end of the project, allowing time for trials employing the methods to be funded, completed and disseminated.

Finally, healthcare providers in the public and private sectors also stand to benefit from this research. As the success rate of confirmatory trials increases, more cost-effective interventions will be identified and recommended, in turn increasing the efficiency of the providers of these interventions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250695</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N015444/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>5841ECCD-C9B1-4B8B-993F-ACC8E9585125</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.1  Primary preventions interventions to modify behaviours or promote well-being</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>90487A08-C473-4CEB-B6D9-011A74AD06CF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.4  Research design and methodologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
