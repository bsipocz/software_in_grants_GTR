This project explores the methods and objectives of such redevelopment, generating the data necessary for identification of best practice through the assessment of redevelopment at the World Trade Center Manhattan, the Oslo Government Quarter, Utoya island, the London bombings, the Boston Marathon Bombing and the Madrid bombing. It is important to address bombsite recovery to assess the implementation of resilience. In the contemporary era, security is practiced against risks and threats which haven't yet occurred in an attempt to prevent disaster. This is particularly true of resilience policies which anticipate a multitude of threats, some of which cannot be prevented, in order to build the capacity to recover from future disasters. But what can we know about resilience if we only anticipate threats, and do not examine practices which enable the recovery of disaster space? This Future Leaders project interrogates a gap at the heart of national and international resilience policy which follows from this anticipatory temporality: there is no codified account of how to manage and reclaim sites of terrorist attack, despite the positing of unpreventable events within resilience and security discourse. Resilience policy is targeted towards the mediation of the next disaster, not the steps by which a previous disaster site can be made resilient. This project changes the temporality of existing security research. It explores whether projects to rebuild, redesign and memorialise sites of terrorist attack mediate threats in a retrospective, rather than anticipatory, manner. Does reconstruction enable resilience? And how can rebuilding be optimized to avoid protest and public dissatisfaction?

It is important to assess the efficacy of post-terrorist reconstruction because extensive public funds are committed to the redevelopment of sites ($10bn at Ground Zero in Manhattan; and at least 650m Kroner is allocated for Oslo's Government Quarter) without codified policy guidance for the undertaking of reconstruction and memorialisation. Additionally, despite the best of intentions of redevelopment committees, few redevelopment projects in recent years have escaped contestation. For example, dozens of self-organised family groups have organised protests against the delayed reconstruction of the WTC in New York, against the abstract memorial which won the vote of 9-11 memorial jury, and the housing of human remains in the 9-11 museum; similarly the lack of official clarity about the future of Oslo's bombed Government Quarter provoked considerable activism from the Norwegian public. 

To address these responses and assess the efficacy and appropriateness of post-terrorist reconstruction, I will deploy a secondary research question: 'When have reconstruction efforts upon sensitive sites provoked hostility and activism from victims' families and protest groups?' Once the methods and objectives of redevelopment are identified, and the situations in which it provokes protest, my final research question draws the research together in the direction of influencing policy: 'What examples of effective and appropriate practice are evident in contemporary case studies of bombsite redevelopment, such that policy guidance might be produced to aid the 'resilience' of post-terrorist space?' As a result, this Future Leaders project is dedicated to the identification of effective and transparent practice in the reclamation of post-terrorist space. 

This project builds upon my existing research into the practice of political violence and its suppression through counter-terrorism (see CV). It makes an original contribution to the study and practice of security by taking the resilience-paradigm-shift seriously: if events are now unpreventable, then research must assess the implementation of resilience at the bombsite.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project seeks to reframe the understanding of resilience which currently dominates policy and academic study, in order to draw attention to the importance of practices which mediate threats which have already materialised. Given the dominant anticipatory conception of threat (that danger which has not yet occurred), security policy and research have not adequately addressed such post-event response. By comparatively exploring the efficacy of attempts to reconstruct post-terrorist sites, it is possible to open this terrain to security research and generate multiple impacts upon target audiences:

1) Policy practitioners and advisors: The project targets a policy-gap with regards to the application of resilience to disaster recovery, so the impact of the research upon policymaking communities is of paramount importance. To that end, I will deploy a four-pronged approach to consolidating the impact of the project. The most prestigious dissemination event will involve an event at the House of Commons, to which policymakers and the resilience practitioner community will be invited. Bob Ainsworth, MP for Coventry North-East, sits on the PAIS impact board and has previously offered the use of a meeting room within the Houses of Parliament for such an event. Furthermore the applicant has the support of Helen Braithwaite (OBE), author of the Civil Contingencies Strategy (the cornerstone of UK resilience policy) and Head of Resilience Policy for the Midlands, who can provide support for delegate invitations to resilience practitioners and government representatives.
This event will be replicated for the European policymaking community through the use of Warwick's facilities and event coordinators in Brussels, adjacent to the European Parliament. These events will be timed around the production of a policy paper which outlines the recommendations of the project regarding the incorporation of publics into decision-making processes surrounding post-terrorist space and examples of best/worst practice from case studies explored during the project. Finally, the research will be periodically documented throughout the Future Leaders project on the Disaster STS network which connects policymakers, practitioners and academics through its web-based and event facilities. This combination of methods will ensure the maximum dissemination potential for the research and lead to significant impact on the policy surrounding the recovery of destroyed space.

2) Public Engagement: A (host funded) event will be held on the 80th anniversary of the WW2 bombing of Coventry to compare historical and contemporary approaches to bombsite reconstruction. Coventry left its famous cathedral unreconstructed as testament to the destructive nature of war - generating a poetic contrast to contemporary stylised reconstructions of post-terrorist space. The event will present the contrast to the public for consideration of both approaches to destroyed space. Wawick's campus is the perfect location for this event, given its situation in Coventry.

3) IS/IR/resilience/disaster recovery scholars: The project makes an original contribution to security, resilience and disaster studies by reversing the temporality of anticipation &amp;amp; prevention which dominates research. This is particularly important in the present security climate, given the ascendance of the resilience paradigm within security policy and its non-application to reconstruction. To know if resilience can be attained, it is necessary to supplement anticipatory security measures with an assessment of practices of bombsite reconstruction.

4) Wider academic community: Outside the politics-related fields of IS and IR, the project also has impact potential within fields of geography and memory studies. I will maximize this interdisciplinary impact by targeting top journals in the Humanities ('Society and Space: Environment and Planning D'; 'Memory Studies') with outputs and by undertaking 3 mobility visits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>135844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Brighton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Sport Brighton</gtr:department><gtr:description>Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Brighton, Sept 2016 - Feb 2017</gtr:description><gtr:id>35C6C355-B685-48A5-AAAD-1BE0D04A1EC6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An attendee of my lecture and workshop is involved in the early discussions regarding memorialisation of the Shoreham air disaster.

These official framings directly identify an 'economic injury' inflicted by the attacks. This controversial framing was not shared with the public. However, minimizing and reversing 'economic injury' was a central pillar in disaster reconstruction efforts. Billions of dollars were distributed to local residents and businesses in an attempt to prevent residential flight and economic blight in lower Manhattan. The sums of money dwarf that allocated to memorialisation efforts. Indeed, the evidence suggests that memorialisation was undertaken within the larger remit of economic recovery in Lower Manhattan, to rescue the area's tourist, business and residential economies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I will answer this question upon completion of the grant in 2018.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E9B3BE53-2A75-4157-912A-4D56FDB03F74</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5878db47ed9f97.28304404</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Organised international conference on generating research impact for postgraduates in Politics and IR</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0A8E4345-0EAE-421C-8CDB-1329DAA3DA30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The fifty attendees of the postgraduate day of the PAIS Impact Conference received cutting edge training in how to generate research impact.
