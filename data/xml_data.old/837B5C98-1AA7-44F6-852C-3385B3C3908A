In many applications dependence between variables has been found to be context specific. Also, as evidenced for example in analysis of forensic evidence, emergency support systems and biological regulation, the product sample space structure intrinsic to the efficiency of BN learning, is not universal. Much criticism has also been levelled at Causal BNs.Alternative representations have consequently appeared, such as case factor diagrams, each with their own theory and methods, often coding supplementary information in terms of a tree or probability tables. None of these alternatives demonstrates the versatility of the BN, and there is ample scope for a single graphical structure with which to model and analyse discrete asymmetric processes.The Chain Event Graph (CEG) has been devised to meet this need. Significant progress has already been achieved in examining how causal hypotheses can be expressed and examined, in developing propagation algorithms, and in developing methodology for eliciting models of this type in biological systems.The proposed research aims to develop a technology that supports the analysis of asymmetric models which is directly analogous to that provided by Bayesian Networks for supporting more symmetrical models. The research divides into theoretical aspects such as the discovery and characterisation of equivalence classes, devising analogues of the d-separation theorem for BNs, and analysis of causal manipulated systems; more applied statistical modelling including algorithms for propagation, dynamic algorithms, and the process of Learning CEGs; and using the theoretical aspects to develop, for example, methods for expressing and feeding back information provided by an experimenter or expert.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242875</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Chain Event Graphs are now being increasing applied to new applications. These include such diverse applications as longitudinal health studies in children relating these to life events, analyses of cerebral palsy, analyses of type two diabetes and the analyses of criminal behaviour. The topic has been widely disseminated internationally in many conferences and the Royal Statistical Society has now hosted a workshop on recent developments under this topic and four PhD students have studied these structures, two successful with one winning the John Copas prize for excellence. A book has been commissioned by Chapman and Hall on the topic of this grant which is planned to appear in 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4B3279CA-58D2-45C3-A665-803F00C59346</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460d3161b7645.98675494</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We developed the theory of Chain Event Graphs. Chain Event Graphs are a family of vert expressive graphical statistical models which contain Bayesian Networks as a very special case. They allow a client to express hypotheses about how units in a given population even when the symmetries in the model are not regular and the possible developments are very diverse. They allow the depiction of many different causal hypotheses within this framework. They also enable us to estimate and select between a wide number of competing hypotheses. in the project we demonstrated through a number of publications how information could be propagated efficiently through such a model, in two other papers how certain causal hypotheses within the class could be articulated and the effects of causal interventions of different kinds and in another how such the best such models could automatically be selected both in static and dynamic environments. The algebra for developing the logical consequences of the model class has also appeared - currently in the form of a research report.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The health applications are particularly exciting and if the applications of these techniques is successful it could be the start of investigating and improiving public health and better and more efficient uses of resources funding medical treatments and public health programmes. The class of problems that can be addressed by these methods is extremely wide. Their genesis was based on a study of certain types of biological models where the information was not only transmitted genetically but also chemically. Over the period of the grant we developed various models of social behaviour and also used the models to study the educational impacts of changes in univeristiy programmes. Since completing the project we have developed the techniques so that they apply to public health models linking children's hospital admissions to their family circumstances and family life events. We are now using the class to try to improve the treatment regimes of sufferers of diabetes and epilepsy, using the techniques to enusre the study is informed by the best statistical and experimental information.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5E1251A2-9F31-4B3B-B13C-05BCC1BA17A9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1525407956.47111547792a128</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3AF1388C-3948-404F-A253-2D36CF8309F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Propagation using Chain Event Graphs</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/31d320136c502127b796526123c6e0cb"><gtr:id>31d320136c502127b796526123c6e0cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peter Thwaites</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_2850871553cac6ce8a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6E79E62C-9E09-4690-9DEC-CAFE9DB6E204</gtr:id><gtr:title>Causal identifiability via Chain Event Graphs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Artificial Intelligence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6281959ce66a9ccb746b5447d159c64f"><gtr:id>6281959ce66a9ccb746b5447d159c64f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thwaites P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe4fe4b8bd542</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0EFAD86B-F62E-406E-944F-78CC0BF62F18</gtr:id><gtr:title>Chain Event Graph MAP Model Selection</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6575d599f4038afc8a8f6822419c437e"><gtr:id>6575d599f4038afc8a8f6822419c437e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guy Freeman</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_9054792743cac2c31c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3C3BD14F-2301-46B7-86C0-5D71908D3A94</gtr:id><gtr:title>Causal analysis with Chain Event Graphs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Artificial Intelligence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6281959ce66a9ccb746b5447d159c64f"><gtr:id>6281959ce66a9ccb746b5447d159c64f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thwaites P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe4fe4ada0a90</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B3FE9A76-BB9C-4226-8A22-78CEB6A0266A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic staged trees for discrete multivariate time series: forecasting, model selection and causal analysis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Bayesian Analysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a6df16b87bdb9373f037265e459ada4e"><gtr:id>a6df16b87bdb9373f037265e459ada4e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Freeman G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d07c07cbfc01b1</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7C81B0C2-3D29-4FA3-9C77-41F9A1BD84F9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bayesian MAP model selection of chain event graphs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Multivariate Analysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a6df16b87bdb9373f037265e459ada4e"><gtr:id>a6df16b87bdb9373f037265e459ada4e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Freeman G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cffcffc9ab2e0b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F036752/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
