The study employs a mixture of scholarly approaches, including literary criticism, global book history, biographical writing and cultural studies. Focusing on the loosely articulated networks of literary and cultural production in the Anglophone Caribbean, the work of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation in Accra, and the mediating role played by the BBC Colonial Service, we will examine the involvement of these networks and institutions in shaping the stylistic and political contours of emerging world literatures in the twentieth century. The project aims to map out how cultural forms such as novels, poems, and short stories circulate through publishing and media channels across the globe, and the ways in which this circulation is rendered highly uneven by unequal international power relations, which are often the legacy of colonialism and imperialism. These inequalities are frequently manifested in the pressures placed on writers and artists from colonized and formerly colonized countries by publishing houses, broadcast institutions, and market forces.

The project will be based around archival research into material in the Caribbean, the UK, and West Africa, much of which is relatively unexplored. This material includes transcripts, letters, and programme information relating to various radio series broadcast in the Caribbean and Ghana in the 1940s and 1950s, including 'Caribbean Voices' and 'West African Voices'. These showcased the work of authors from those regions and were important in providing access for a wider public to discussions about literary, cultural and political issues during an era in which colonial rule was ending and the prospect of national independence was on the horizon. The project is unique in that it will bring together archival material currently scattered across three continents, examining this through a global optic attentive to the uneven circulation of cultural forms.

The project will make use of exclusive access to the papers, diaries, and letters of the BBC producer Henry Swanzy. Swanzy's career is indicative of the connections that existed between literary and broadcast histories across the three continents, having produced 'Caribbean Voices' between 1946-54, before becoming Head of Programmes for the Gold Coast Broadcasting System in Accra in 1954. Moreover, Swanzy's writings in his diaries provide a wealth of stories about working life both at the BBC and abroad, while also registering key cultural trends and the social and political upheavals of the post-war era. One of the principal aims of the project is to investigate how the BBC was enmeshed in the political discussions over race and immigration at the time.

&amp;quot;Decolonizing Voices&amp;quot; will produce a series of outputs both for an academic and a wider audience, including a popular critical edition of Swanzy's memoirs, as well as scholarly writings (articles, a short monograph) on the interconnections between literary and broadcast histories informed by recent debates on world literature and the politics of literary value. Another key output of the project will be a radio programme to be broadcast on the BBC World Service and stations in the Caribbean and Ghana. The programme will examine the importance of the historical relationships between media institutions, programme makers, and literary magazine series in the era of decolonization. Our programme, in revisiting these relationships, will help to inform and enhance discussions over the function and future of public service broadcasting in a &amp;quot;globalized age&amp;quot;.

In these ways, the &amp;quot;Decolonizing Voices&amp;quot; project will make a vital contribution to an understanding of the relationships between literary production, the role of broadcasting as a medium of cultural expression, and the legacies of empire.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a wide-ranging project, the outputs of which will have several non-academic beneficiaries. Since it is in part about the history and status of the media and broadcast culture within wider society, the research is inherently imbedded in issues of public discourse beyond the academic realm.

One of the main users and beneficiaries of the project will be public sector and private sector media agencies in locations across the globe, primarily the BBC, the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) and Joy FM in Accra, Ghana (JFM). &amp;quot;Decolonizing Voices&amp;quot; will be able to help these media agencies in their efforts to elucidate, account for and represent to the public the histories of their emergence and development. So far it has been difficult to place these histories in a coherent narrative given the fragmented and often incomplete nature of many archives. For example, much of the material relating to the BBC Colonial Service is scattered, with resources held either beyond UK shores, or in some cases in private collections. More specifically, separate parts of conversations and correspondence between contributors to Caribbean Voices is often broken up, and held on either side of the Atlantic. In addition, in both the Caribbean and West Africa the confusion and ferment of the end of colonial rule meant that archiving was rarely done systematically. This project will allow a fuller understanding of the individual histories of these national media agencies and the history of interconnection between them. This is of timely interest, as the era of &amp;quot;globalization&amp;quot; has led many national media organisations, involved in the global marketplace, to seek to emphasise the historic international dimensions of their operations.
 
Beyond the Higher Education sector, one of the project's outputs (the radio programme) may also appeal in particular to teachers in schools and colleges in the UK seeking to put together information on the history and role of the BBC as a national institution and global presence. Given the attention now paid to Black history and &amp;quot;globalization&amp;quot; within the national curriculum, this output may provide a useful case study in the history of cultural and political decolonization.

In addition, with its emphasis on the shaping influence had by the BBC on collective debates over race, nationalism, and immigration in the post-war era, and given both the developments in new technologies and recent discussions over the role and responsibilities of the media within the public sphere, the project will appeal to culturally and politically engaged members of the public beyond the bounds of academia. There is clearly a popular audience for the topics our project covers as evidenced by the recent BBC Radio Four broadcasts about the BBC and Empire, including Colin Grant's Caribbean Voices and Razia Iqbal's World Service Writers, as well as more general programmes on Caribbean literature such as Stir it Up: 50 years of writing Jamaica (10th September, 2012). Our project's investigations would help in informing and enhancing the public debates over the function and future of public service broadcasting in a &amp;quot;globalized age&amp;quot;.

In the UK, information on the cultural history of national institutions such as public service broadcasters is relatively easily available. However, in parts of the Caribbean and West Africa this is less often the case. We envisage making such histories (of the CBC and GBC, for example) more widely accessible to local communities through specific outputs of the project. These outputs will maximise the potential international impacts of our work to as wide an audience as possible.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197009</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ghana, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Voices of Ghana series with GBC</gtr:description><gtr:id>51468A64-E1E0-4E01-891D-BA733CE6DEFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>GBC have asked that 5 programmes be completed before they begin to air.

It featured not only talks by internationally recognised scholars but also contributions from the Director of Peepal Tree Press, the primary publisher of Caribbean and Black British writing in Britain today.

A number of the undergraduate students who attended the conference were well engaged with the talks and expressed interest in now pursuing Caribbean literature at MA level. Also, informal discussions held at the conference have led to discussions that a new research network might be established to consider more specifically the role of visual artists in the literary and broadcast networks that our project examines.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>568b9ee63a2fe9.66925354</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>paper presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Series of interviews with writers, publishers, and other relevant people</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3396F5B9-AE9F-48E1-901E-E9A67DDEB735</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are conducting interviews with a series of relevant scholars, writers, publishers and others who were involved with the broadcast institutions or publishers that are the subject of our enquiry, or have written on these previously.

They also became the basis for a popular literary and film evening, which brought together writers and film-makers associated in various ways with the Caribbean Voices radio programme and GBC to perform material originally broadcast on these platforms and to talk about its connection with their recent work. This cultural evening was attended not only by scholars and students, but also by members of the public.

Our findings and the discussions we have had with Dr. James Procter (University of Newcastle) have informed the research of both parties. Procter's recent article in Small Axe on BBC producer Una Marson acknowledges our project's work on Henry Swanzy and Caribbean Voices.

Our findings also provided the basis for the radio programme we have produced, to be broadcast later this year on Ghanaian Radio. Many of the interviews carried out in the course of the research have been featured in the script, along with archival findings from the project.

The project's website, which hosted interviews by various writers, scholars, and programme-makers attracted attention from parties both within and outside the university. It raised the profile of the project sufficiently that project members were invited to contribute to the academic blog, Africa in Words. The Research fellow's blog post discussing the Ghanaian aspect of the project appeared on the 60th anniversary of the first broadcast of the programme 'Singing Net'. This then led to an invitation by the Royal African Society to present the findings of the project on the 'Emergent Discourses on African Literature' panel at the Africa Writes Conference, held at the British Library. This conference was open to and attended by members of the public.

The Caribbean element of the project's findings and some of the archival materials was discussed at an open event at the University of Warwick, attended by academics, Caribbean artists (including renowned essayist and writer Thomas Glave), and members of the public.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C35C452F-4A33-49E7-ABEA-42182EA394E6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>568ab001493da3.49891181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project investigated the interconnected history of broadcasting culture across three continents in the post-war era. It focused on the loosely articulated networks of literary and cultural production in the Anglophone Caribbean, the work of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation in Accra, and the mediating role played by the BBC Colonial Service. Through an examination of these networks and institutions, we discovered how they shaped the stylistic and political contours of emerging world literatures in the twentieth century. Our close analyses of the diaries of Henry Swanzy, producer of the BBC radio programme Caribbean Voices, have enabled us to develop a clearer understanding of the complex linkages between metropolitan modernists and writers from the colonial world. In this way, our articles and conference papers have been able to intervene in recent debates over the constitution of global modernism and the dynamics of canon formation. We have brought to light how Swanzy's attitude to the material he broadcast might be understood as complexly related to changes in the post-war political order, in particular Britain's attempts to recalibrate its imperial position by stressing an ideal of 'commonwealth' that nominally ceded greater equality to its dominions without overturning the system as a whole. In a mirror of his political position, Swanzy's editorial preferences on Caribbean Voices simultaneously stressed 'local colour' while also policing the boundaries of taste and literary value in accordance with metropolitan expectations.

We are finalizing the manuscript for the critical edition of extracts from Henry Swanzy's diaries, which throw fascinating light on the relationships between BBC programme-makers, Caribbean and West African writers, and the political climate at the end of empire.

The project has also unearthed a number of new findings, including new archival material. As a result of Research Fellow' Victoria Smith's extensive research in the archives of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) - archives that have hitherto remained relatively inaccessible - we have uncovered the ambivalent role of seconded BBC personnel in the institutional history of GBC. This research also led to our developing contacts with academics, programme-makers, and creative writers, both those active at the time of GBC's original broadcasts and those working and writing today, within its legacy. As a result, we have been given access to unpublished archives such as diaries and memoirs, which have helped illuminate on the social and political forces impacting upon writers and programme-makers in the era of decolonization.

Through the international conference we organized, we were able to bring together scholars working in a variety of disciplines to discuss the impact and influence of colonial policy on broadcast culture. As a result of contacts established at the conference, we are developing a special edition of the journal Wasafiri and a follow-up conference to be hosted at the University of Ghana.

A one-day symposium at Warwick in November 2015 helped to develop the research findings further by examining the relationships between literary networks and visual artists from the Caribbean.

We also conducted interviews with a series of relevant scholars, writers, and others who were involved with broadcast institutions or publishers such as the BBC, GBC, and James Currey Publishers. These interviews were recorded and placed on our project website, where they are accessible to all.

The research we have carried out on this grant has also allowed us to produce a radio programme for broadcast in Ghana that examines the establishment of the flagship literary programme on the Gold Coast Broadcasting System (later GBC). Our work has also led us to pursue the re-publication of 'Voices of Ghana: Literary Contributions to Radio Ghana, 1955-57' (1958), a landmark of its time as an early anthology of Ghanaian writing in English. Having prepared the manuscript and established contributors, the Research Fellow has now secured the interest of the publishers (now represented by the Ministry of Communication) in re-producing the anthology.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As a result of our findings, particularly the archival material discovered in Ghana and in the BBC written archives in Caversham, we will be putting together a new project, building on the current research. This project will examine more specifically the institutional history of GBC, its literary legacies, and its entanglement in Cold War politics.

As a result of responses to the production of the radio programme in Ghana, the Assistant Director of Radio at GBC has asked that project members might oversee the re-launch and production of 'Singing Net' (under its later name of 'Voices of Our Time') as a weekly series. 

The critical edition of Henry Swanzy's diaries will, we feel, be a great resource for scholars and students in the fields of Caribbean Studies, postcolonial studies, broadcast culture, and twentieth-century history. We have already received a number of expressions of interest from researchers and teachers working in these areas.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>99C26EA8-2998-4F0F-9A5B-88C48EA31E72</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>568aa86953fa45.71123783</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/ccs/staff/postdocfellows/mniblett/worldliteratureandbroadcastculture/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>12AD3857-3F19-4F56-846F-CF8F851841B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interview with Atukwei Okai</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Wasafiri</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5fe6b1917abf1c1fde922a8fbfdc0c67"><gtr:id>5fe6b1917abf1c1fde922a8fbfdc0c67</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith, V.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>568a80a16b9c04.33543855</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BBE66B4C-265B-4618-A84F-44C625EA0358</gtr:id><gtr:title>GCBS' '1955 Intake' and the Beginnings of 'Singing Net'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Wasafiri</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/443d3a5aa69a987d80c3df2af5e7351e"><gtr:id>443d3a5aa69a987d80c3df2af5e7351e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith, Victoria</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>568a7f90e298e3.21681709</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A14B63A9-FD14-4800-B52D-F2958AF0B068</gtr:id><gtr:title>Radio Ghana at 80: becoming the station of an independent nation?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4da9f567755ce10e8a258dff2d4e404c"><gtr:id>4da9f567755ce10e8a258dff2d4e404c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith, VE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>568b9aff0685c7.87623902</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9AFACE8B-8489-43D5-A05E-885CA98CF976</gtr:id><gtr:title>Style as Habitus: World Literature, Decolonization, and Caribbean Voices</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9a6a6ca23e8fa4ee4b3225a089b8b65e"><gtr:id>9a6a6ca23e8fa4ee4b3225a089b8b65e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Niblett, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>542bd5b305ed80.81994700</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BCC70CD0-A1CD-49B4-AD44-020D3AD8E45E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Singing Net at 60: broadcasting literature on Radio Ghana</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4da9f567755ce10e8a258dff2d4e404c"><gtr:id>4da9f567755ce10e8a258dff2d4e404c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith, VE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>568b9c31485bb6.50387300</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4B34F3D0-D06E-44B8-9BF7-8B85FBCCB61F</gtr:id><gtr:title>This is Accra Calling: the ABC, BBC and CBC in the making of GBC</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4da9f567755ce10e8a258dff2d4e404c"><gtr:id>4da9f567755ce10e8a258dff2d4e404c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith, VE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>568b9b8f372113.37445560</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>226DF221-3607-4D51-B6D3-145BD094BC22</gtr:id><gtr:title>Voices of Ghana: Literature, Radio and Independence</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Department of History Seminar Series</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e0af38584d568e791227a32c9306fabc"><gtr:id>e0af38584d568e791227a32c9306fabc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith, V.E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>542ac9e54916a0.19545254</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DCF95EBC-7D7A-45B0-BCC2-29F4D863C0E6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Amu Djoleto, A.
