Its formation modified the composition of the mantle and the atmosphere, it supports life, and it remains a sink for carbon dioxide through weathering and erosion. The continental crust has therefore had a key role in the evolution of the Earth, and yet the timing of its generation, and the processes that shaped its evolution, remain a topic of considerable debate.

Views on the evolution of the continental crust have changed dramatically as ideas on geological processes have evolved and as methods to interrogate the rock record have advanced through developments in stratigraphic analysis, petrography, paleontology, geochemistry, geochronology, geophysics and modelling. Crucially our understanding of the processes involved in the generation and the evolution of the continental crust has grown enormously through the latter part of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries following on from the development and acceptance of plate tectonic theory.

A fundamental question is to determine when plate tectonics started, and a few studies have recently argued that this major change in Earth's evolution may have happened 3 billion years ago during the Mesoarchaean. This model of Earth's evolution remains highly controversial and much debated by the community. The validation of this model is therefore a key step in understanding the large-scale evolution of the Earth, through repeated interaction between the mantle, the continental crust and the atmosphere. 

This proposal is to explore the processes of generation, maturation and growth of the continental crust through time, using a new geochemical approach based on the analysis of various isotopes systems with different geochemical properties and decay constants (K-Ca, Rb-Sr, U-Pb and Sm-Nd), in a large range of rocks, minerals and sediments with pre- and post-3 Ga ages. The data will allow to establish the composition of the continental crust at different stages of its evolution, as well as the variation in the balance between subduction-related and intraplate- related magmatism through time, with a confidence that has not been achieved hitherto. A sharp transition from intraplate-related to subduction-related magmas at 3 billion years ago, along with high rates of crust recycling from this time, would constitute clear evidence for the global onset of plate tectonics at this time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A - Beneficiaries

Beneficiaries of this research will be:

- The academic domain (1)

- Everyone in the wider public fascinated by the great events and processes that shaped our planet (2)

- People in the research and industries fields interested in the measurement of Ca isotopic abundances (3)

- The manufacturers of mass spectrometers (4)


B - How they will benefit this research

(1): The main beneficiary of this research will be the academic domain. The question of &amp;quot;When and how the continental crust formed?&amp;quot; has been a matter of intense debate in Earth Sciences for the past four decades, and this proposal aims to bring key answers to that long-standing question.

(2): The development and the acceptance of plate tectonic theory has been one of most popular scientific discoveries of the 20th century. However, when plate tectonics started remains highly debated, and this proposal is to establish that the global onset of plate tectonics happened 3 billions years ago. Once validated and accepted by the scientific community, this scientific discovery may constitute a major update to school and high school teaching books.
 
(3): This proposal is partly built upon the development of a method for analysing Ca isotopes by ID-TIMS, with a level of precision and accuracy that has not been achieved hitherto. The measurement of Ca isotopes has challenged the analysts for more than three decades; therefore people in the research and industries fields interested in the measurement of Ca isotopic abundances will also benefit this research. In detail, the variations in the isotope composition of Ca caused by fractionation in heterogeneous systems and by nuclear reactions can provide insight into a wide range of geological, biological, and cosmic processes; and so Ca isotopes have a wide spectrum of applications in cosmochemistry, geochemistry, archaeology, palaeontology, palaeoclimatic, nutritional, and biomedical studies. Ca is a biologically essential element and represents a common constituent of the mineralized tissues as well as soft tissue and body fluids. Ca isotopes therefore find application in biochemistry and clinical medicine to study calcium metabolism. A 3-days workshop entitled &amp;quot;Measurement, applications and perspectives of Ca isotopes in Earth, Planetary, Life and Social Sciences&amp;quot; will be organised in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol in the second quarter of Year 2. This workshop will bring together researchers from a large number of Schools at the University of Bristol (e.g., Earth Sciences, Archaeology, Biology), as well as a number of researchers within UK and internationally.

(4): Because of the large domains of applications of Ca isotopes, my research will benefit the manufacturers of scientific equipment interested in building and developing analytical platforms for the measurement of Ca isotopes (e.g., Thermo Scientific). One aspect of the development of the analysis of Ca isotopes will be to use a 10^10 Ohm current amplifier (instead of the standard 10^11 Ohm) to measure high intensity beams on the 40Ca. Thermo Scientific, the manufacturer of the Triton TIMS hosted by the Bristol Isotope Group, may benefit from the tests runs at Bristol and hence decide to improve the specifications of newly produced mass spectrometers. A specific method of data acquisition and reduction will be set up for Ca isotopes measurement (I have more that 5 five years experience in this domain) and this method is likely to be used by Thermo Scientific to update the version of their software.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>517478</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings on the evolution of the continents through time have been used to make articles in two high-impact scientific journals aimed at a broad audience, &amp;quot;New Scientist&amp;quot; (issue 3030, 18 July 2015) and &amp;quot;Science &amp;amp; Vie&amp;quot; (issue 1190 November 2016).

The results for Ca so far are encouraging, as I have managed to reduce both the internal and external precision of the measurements by a factor of 1.5-2, in comparison to what was typically achieved in Bristol before I started my project. A prototype Faraday cup, specifically designed to collect the large 40Ca beam and now available in Bristol, will help further improve the external precision of the 40Ca/44Ca measurement. For Pb isotopes, together with my PDRA (H. Delavault), we obtained a precision, an accuracy, and a long-term reproducibility in the measurement of the 206Pb/204Pb ratios better than 1-2% for a 10 &amp;micro;m spot size. These results are well beyond initial expectations, which is extremely encouraging for the rest of the project, and we will report our findings in a research article that is currently under writing to Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry. The development of Sr isotopes analyses will be undertaken from April 2017.

Evidence for how continental crust formed and evolved through time remains highly controversial, and one aspect of my research is to unravel the composition of 'new' continental crust at time of its extraction from the mantle. Geochemically, the new crust constitutes the source of the rocks that dominate the geological record, but in most cases not the rocks themselves. Thus, its composition cannot be easily determined simply by measuring major and trace element compositions of rocks presently exposed. I have addressed this issue by accessing the 'time-integrated' Rb/Sr ratios and SiO2 contents in over 12,000 samples of crustal melts with formation ages ranging from the Hadean to the Phanerozoic. The data highlight that the composition of new crust was largely mafic over the first 1.5 Ga of Earth's evolution, consistent with magmatism in pre-plate tectonic settings. Since ~3 Ga, i.e. the inferred timing for the onset of plate tectonics, new continental crust appears to have become more differentiated and thicker towards the present. These findings have been widely acknowledged by the community during the last Goldschmidt and EGU international meetings, and a manuscript is published to Nature Geoscience (Dhuime et al., 2015). In addition I have been involved in a number of collaborative studies on crustal evolution. Nine papers have been published so far (Cuppelli et al., 2014 - Geology; Claesson et al., 2014 - GSL sp. Pub; Standish et al., 2014 - Chem. Geol.; Miles et al., 2014 - J. Petrol.; Jones et al., 2015 - GCA; Delavault, Dhuime et al., 2016 - Geology; Hawkesworth, Cawood and Dhuime, 2016 - GSA Today; Westin et al., 2016 - Precam. Research; Schumlyanskyy et al., 2017 - Precam. Resarch), one paper is in press (Hawkesworth et al. - AREPS) and two papers are under review (Dhuime et al. - Geology; Dhuime et al. Sedim. Geol.).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The measurement of Ca isotopes has challenged the analysts for more than three decades. Ca isotopes have a wide spectrum of applications in cosmochemistry, geochemistry, archaeology, palaeontology, palaeoclimatic, nutritional, and biomedical studies; therefore people in the research and industries fields interested in the measurement of Ca isotopic abundances shall benefit my findings (see above). 

When plate tectonics started remain highly debated, and my new findings summarised above (i.e. that the new continental crust appears to have become more differentiated and thicker since ~3 Ga) are consistent with some recent/controversial models arguing for the onset of plate tectonics 3 Ga ago (Shirey and Richardson, 2011 - Science; Dhuime et al., 2012 - Science). An important controversy has remained over the composition and thickness of the early continental crust, and my findings have important implications for global models of Earth formation and evolution through time (see, for instance, a recent review on thermal models of evolution in Korenaga, 2013 - Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci.).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>54947AD2-C37B-4272-8342-857E4A783884</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460bf49d82235.93591838</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and
