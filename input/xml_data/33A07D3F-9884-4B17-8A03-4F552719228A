Trusted IoT Ecosystem</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N028074/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the seamless integration of physical objects, sensors and mobile devices onto the Internet. The IoT encompasses many different technologies, services and standards and is seen by many as the cornerstone of the ICT market in the coming years. However, IoT solutions comprise more than just the hardware and software necessary to realize the technical infrastructure, as they also include the human actors, organisations, policies and regulatory systems involved. With some estimates predicting 50 billion devices by 2020, and the proportion of data collected passively through machine-to-machine transactions surpassing that actively generated by individuals - solutions are needed to strengthen trust. 

Using an existing community Internet of Things testbed located in the Tillydrone district of Aberdeen, we will explore what it means to realize solutions that are transparent, accountable, and which empower end-users. The TrustLens is our vision of a future toolset that will enable individuals, and the communities of which they are a part, to better understand and manage the data about them. However, before we can realize the TrustLens, several key issues need to be investigated: 

What are the appropriate governance arrangements covering IoT deployments? How do we deliver meaningful accountability? How can we develop an understanding of the interplay between individuals and devices, and the wider relationship to social/cultural norms? What are the attitudes of citizens and communities to privacy and risk in an IoT context? How should risks and benefits be communicated? How do users make informed decisions to judge the trustworthiness of information? 

Answers to these (and the many other questions that will certainly emerge) will lead us to develop prototype solutions that will be evaluated with members of the Tillydrone community. Our ambition is to create a means by which a user can review the characteristics of an IoT device in terms of its impact on their personal data, answering questions such as: What type of data is it capturing? For what purpose? Who sees it? What are the (potential) benefits and risks? They also should be able to exert a degree of control over their data, and be guided to assess its reliability and accuracy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The scope of the proposed research means that there are range of organisations and individuals who will benefit:

* Public.
* Public sector organisations (including our partners in Aberdeen City Council),
* Third sector and community organisations interested in the dynamics of personal data solutions.
* Government and policy-makers interested in future legal and regulatory frameworks around trust, personal data and the Internet of Things (IoT).
* Business (inc SMEs) active in the IoT, sensing, and app markets.

How will they benefit from this research?

Members of the public living within our community testbed area will benefit from their direct involvement in the research - through enhanced understanding of emerging technologies and the associated personal data challenges. The wider public will be exposed to these issues via a series of public engagement activities - our aim being to stimulate debate about the need for user-centred IoT solutions that embrace transparency, accountability and empowerment.

Public and third sector organisations will gain greater understanding of the challenges associated with future technology deployments into communities, and models for sustainable governance and future accountability.

Government and policy-makers at local, devolved and national levels will be able to access evidence drawn from a real user community situated at the edge of society. The potential for IoT solutions to transform various aspects of public service is often noted in the policy landscape, but we will present government with greater understanding of the attitudes of individual citizens to data from such devices (including perception of risks and benefits).

Businesses will gain access to a range of solutions necessary to deliver greater trust in the IoT. These will be accessible through a range of opensource software prototypes and frameworks, and via our contributions to open standards (W3C). Through preliminary conversations with Nominet UK, BT, and IBM there is clear evidence of interest in our proposals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>809734</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Station House Media Unit (SHMU)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>SHMU - TrustLens Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>924CD4D6-BFC5-445F-85FD-E6B890674A02</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Too early to say.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c86567507012.58819274-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Access to personnel, network of contacts.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing our expertise with SHMU on: community Internet of Things deployments, user-centred design methods.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aberdeen City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Aberdeen City - TrustLens Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>57436A28-004A-48B4-B0BC-D41706A8F0BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To early to indicate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8614dd30a48.19297274-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Council has provided access to personnel, expertise, contacts and visibility of Council IoT deployments.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Engagement with Aberdeen City Council staff spanning a number of departments including IT &amp;amp; Infrastructure, Community Engagement, Economic Development.
