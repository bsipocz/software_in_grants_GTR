Literature</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L013509/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This international network, which responds to the research agenda set by the AHRC theme 'Translating Cultures', intends to analyse the literature created by Dalits (formerly referred to as Untouchables), one of the most oppressed and silenced communities in India. People with caste backgrounds which used to be referred to as 'Untouchable' form roughly 20% of India's population. The term 'Dalit' (meaning 'broken' or 'crushed' in Marathi) has been chosen by 'Untouchables' themselves as a nom de guerre. Dalit literature with its representation and assertion of subaltern cultures is the most significant development in Indian literature in the last three decades, but this unique literary corpus has not yet received the international recognition it deserves. 

Despite the fact that the 1950 constitution of independent India abolished Untouchability, discrimination against people of untouchable caste backgrounds has continued, validated by Hinduism. Inspired by the political activism that challenged the discrimination on the grounds of caste in Maharashtra in the 1970s, Dalit writer-activists developed a highly politicised literature in the vernacular language of Marathi. This set the precedent for the emergence of other regional Dalit literatures in vernacular Indian languages such as Tamil in Tamil Nadu, Malayalam in Kerala, Telugu in Andhra Pradesh, Kannada in Karnataka and Hindi. Dalit literature is often highly innovative in its form, narrative perspective and use of language but so far only the work of a few Dalit authors has been translated into English and other European languages.

This project, undertaken under the aegis of Nottingham Trent University's Centre for Postcolonial Studies, will open up an international dialogue on hitherto unresearched dimensions of Dalit literature. Even when studied in India by critics familiar with the original language of Dalit writing, the analysis of the literary quality of Dalit literature has been neglected; instead it has been almost exclusively explored from a sociological and historical perspective. This project aims to produce a network whose research outputs contextualise Dalit literary texts in order to make them accessible to a wider audience, but also analyse them as literary artefacts, drawing on the methods of literary criticism and postcolonial and feminist theory. Academic postcolonial literature courses increasingly include course texts in translation but rarely from Dalit literature because academic studies do not exist that specifically enable the non-expert to engage with these texts. This project, with its varied research output, intends to close this gap. 

The grant will fund a series of conferences, workshops and other events that are exclusively dedicated to the analysis of this exciting and previously almost 'invisible' literature outside of India. The project will thus establish an international dialogue between key researchers in the areas of Dalit literature, foster the close collaboration of UK and European academics working in the field of literary and cultural studies with Indian scholars researching in this field and cultivate contacts with authors, translators and publishers of Dalit literature. 

This project will produce several published research outputs, such as a multi-contributor volume and several articles in peer-reviewed journals, thus allowing non-experts in South Asian Studies, researchers in literary studies, students and the public to engage with this work, which tends to be produced in vernacular Indian languages for a regional audience. These outputs are aimed at sustaining the network and drawing attention to and discussing this wealth of literary material that has been largely neglected outside of India and thereby contributing to a dialogue with previously marginalised cultures and communities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Those outside academia benefiting from the network project include:

The Dalit literary movement in general: the network will increase its international visibility, stimulate more high-quality translations into English and other European languages but also other Indian vernacular languages. The Dalit literary movement will benefit from the inclusion of Dalit literature in contemporary debates surrounding literature and its critical and theoretical analysis; this inclusion in contemporary literary debates will encourage the Dalit literary movement to look beyond the sometimes enabling but also sometimes stifling cocoon of Dalit literary production and Dalit literary criticism in India. 

Specific invited Dalit writers through international exposure at the networking events and public readings and closer engagement with an international, multi-disciplinary academic community. Dalit writers will deliver keynote speeches at the conferences and workshops and read from their work at the symposium at Leicester University, during the conference in Nottingham and the workshop in Montpellier. The investigators are currently communicating with the New Art Exchange in Nottingham, a gallery and cultural centre that fosters cross-cultural dialogue, to host a reading by the Dalit writer Sharankumar Limbale, and with the bookshops Les Cinq Continents and Le Grain des Mots in Montpellier to host a reading by the Dalit writer and critic Aniket Jaaware. 

The Dalit community, in particular in the UK and the diaspora, by engaging with the network and thus reaching a wider academic and general audience for community and anti-caste discrimination projects; important non-academic partners in the network are for example the UK-based Dalit Solidarity Network (DSN), the Anti-Caste Discrimination Alliance (ACDA) and CasteAwayArts. Meena Varma of the DSN, Santosh Das of the ACDA and Reena Jaisiah and Rena Dipti Annobil have confirmed that they will attend the network's events and that they will publicise them on their websites and emailing lists.

Translators of Dalit literature through the development of a network of practitioners and theorists of translation, many of whom are not affiliated to academic institutions, in order to stimulate the production of more high-quality translations of Dalit literature. The network will draw on the expertise of the University of East Anglia's British Centre for Literary Translation in order to foster a professional practice of translation since so far Dalit writers are often forced to rely on the goodwill of non-professional translators who translate their work free of charge.

The publishing industry through networking with writers and translators and a wide academic and non-academic audience for Dalit literary texts at the proposed conferences and workshops. The investigators have already established contact with S. Anand, the Editor at Navayana (who confirmed attendance at the workshop in Hyderabad), the Director Nandini Rao and the Managing Director Veenu Luthria at Orient Black Swan in Hyderabad and the Assistant Editor Aakash Chakraborty at Routledge India.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Savitribai Phule Pune University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Contribution of Savitribhai Phule Pune University to the conference held at that university.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3DE9CA9A-436C-486D-9148-2B4F574CCEA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The generous support of Savitribhai Phule Pune University of all domestic speakers made it possible for a large number of early career scholars from India to present papers.

Cherian in three cinemas in Europe.

Papilio Buddha is the story of a group of displaced Dalits (former Untouchables) in the Western Ghats of India. The film brings into focus an example of the epic land struggles which are fought in various regions of the state and all over India, and the oppression of indigenous people by the powerful political and social establishments. It is also mapping the environmental degradation and abuse of pristine mountain habitats by outside forces, thus lining physical and political oppression with environmental destruction. 

The first screening too place in Montpellier June 11th 2015 at the M&amp;eacute;diath&amp;egrave;que Fellini; Jayan Cherian was present for Q&amp;amp;A. He was also the Guest Film Director at the international conference 'New Ecotones' in Montpellier from 11 to 13 June 2015.

The second screening was in Nottingham on 21 June, at 6pm, at Broadway Cinema (also followed by Q&amp;amp;A with the audience). 

The third screening in Norwich on Monday 29 June at Cinema City was also followed by Q&amp;amp;A and was free for the conference participants of the fourth network conference on 'Dalit Literature and / in Translation', an international conference at the British Centre for Literary Translation, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK, on 29-30 June 2015. Jayan K. Cherina was also a Keynote Speaker at this conference, which was attended by 50 people from the Europe, India and the United States.

The screenings were announced as being hosted by Nottingham Trent University's Centre for Postcolonial Studies, Paul Valery University Montpellier and the AHRC-funded research network 'Writing, Analysing, Translating Dalit Literature' (see http://pays-anglophones.upv.univ-montp3.fr/?page_id=996).

He read from his translated poetry for 10 minutes and then took questions from the audience. His reading was enthusiastically received by the audience and many people approached us afterwards and wanted to know more about his work and Dalit poetry in general. This reading is part of a series of poetry readings at Wired, organised by NTU creative writing staff Rory Waterman and Andrew Taylor and NTU creative writing PhD student Rebecca Cullen. These readings usually take place once a month with one or two featured poets and two open mic sessions. They are very popular and the venue is always filled to capacity (it hold up to 50 people). 

Beside his reading at Wired, Cghinnaswamy also worked with students and members of staff at Nottingham Trent University for two weeks and his visit was very productive as staff and students engaged, often for the first time, with Dalit poetry and responded very warmly to it.

These successful events contributed to the publication of Chinnaswamy's translated collection of poetry Before It Rains Again by the Liverpool-based publisher Erbacce Press in December 2016. One of the editors is the organiser of the Wired readings, Andrew Taylor, and the response by the audience at the Wired reading and at the NTU events persuaded him that there is a market for Dalit poetry in the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7cd818909b0.78816828</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3nPbiVmvv8</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Library Exhibition in Montpellier</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E1F0477C-3FEA-414A-804B-F261362DC308</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A book display of the library's collection of Dalit literature and Dalits Studies was put together by the St Charles Graduate Library on the campus of Universit&amp;eacute; Paul-Val&amp;eacute;ry Montpellier 3.

The website contains a section on news and a detailed account of all major netwok events. In May 2016 we also included a publications page, which lists relevant publications to the study of Dalit literature. Network members keep sending us references in order to help update this invaluable resource for all researchers on Dalit literature.

This workshop represented the last major network event of the funded series and its attendance by so many writers, publishers and translators who are not usually present at academic conferences created a distinct atmosphere and enabled new encounters which hopefully inspire future events and initiatives. Invited speakers included the writers Des Raj Kali, Balbir Madhopuri, Kalyani Thakur Chaanral, Manoranjan Byapari, Cho Dharman, Satish Chandar, the artists Durgabai and Subhash Vyam, and the publishers Navayana, Zubaan Publishing, Routledge India, Sage-Stree Samya, Democratic Action Forum of Dalits, Women and Minorities, Khabar Lahariya, and Yoda Press, as well as the writer and publisher Bhagwant Rasulpuri.

In the process the research network fostered a research agenda whose multi-disciplinary approach transformed the way Dalit literature's literary and aesthetic features were perceived and analysed.

The network's main objectives were all met with resounding success.

We aimed to raise the visibility of Dalit literature outside India and make it accessible to multiple academic and non-academic audiences and we achieved this by hosting six major international conferences, symposia and workshops at Nottingham Trent University (June 2014), the University of Leicester (June 2014), the University of Montpellier (October 2014), the University of East Anglia (June 2016), Savitribhai Phule Pune University (December 2015) and Delhi University (December 2015). All events had Dalit writers as keynote speakers and were each attended by 30 to 100 people, which is excellent for conferences on such a relatively neglected area of research. The project therefore established an international dialogue between key researchers in the areas of Dalit literature, fostered the close collaboration of UK and European academics working in the field of literary and cultural studies with Indian scholars researching in this field and cultivated contacts with authors, translators and publishers of Dalit literature. All conferences were organised on a scale that was even more ambitious than we had originally planned in the grant application. This was partly due to additional funding that was provided by the University of Montpellier and Savitribhai Phule Pune University but also due to the fact that the research network was embraced by scholars, writers and translators to an extent that far exceeded our expectations.

We had planned to increase and refine the analytical methods employed in the study of Dalit literature and realised this by bringing together experts in the field of literary and cultural studies, in particular postcolonial studies, with experts in South Asian literatures, history and cultures. We succeeded in creating cross-disciplinary and theory-informed debates at our conferences and this will bear fruit in the network publications that we are currently editing.

We had intended to put particular emphasis on the topic of translation in relation to Dalit literature. We dedicated the UEA conference exclusively to this topic but we also made room for dialogue with Dalit writers and translators at all major events we organised. These debates gave impetus to various translation projects and we hope that we can report on their success in the near future.

As planned, we create a website to publicise the network's events widely and sustain it beyond the period funded by the award and we produced an email subscription list that keeps members of the network informed of events and facilitate and stimulate research in all areas relating to Dalit literature. We also created the digital publication channel Dalit Voice and Vision, which hosts recordings of some of the network events and which will cover future events and recordings of interviews, digital autobiographies and performances.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research network stimulated research on Dalit literature and had a strong cross-disciplinary impact on researchers in the field of postcolonial and cultural studies, Dalit studies and South Asian studies. In the short term, the research network's activities appear to have contributed to the fact that there are now postgraduate students working on research projects on Dalit literature in the UK, France and Spain, all of whom are supervised by members of the research network. This new generation of researchers has already benefitted from the connections that the network established and will continue to do so in the future. 
 
The network's published outputs on Dalit literature, in particular the forthcoming special edition in the Journal of Commonwealth Literature and the forthcoming edited collection by Orient Blackswan as well as the articles authored by the PI and those produced by members of the network will benefit researchers in the fields of postcolonial and cultural studies, but also experts in the area of South Asian studies and will develop the discipline of Dalit literary studies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>21DFECED-4924-4729-94C3-8926F67EF044</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460c057d1d725.84348479</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://dalitliterature.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>95BC3DBF-8E3F-45B0-BD57-341DC53B47C3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Foreword</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/862b68161b8c66ac82740c67a466f849"><gtr:id>862b68161b8c66ac82740c67a466f849</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thiara N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bfd4a59b4288.60795092</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D7381AA4-82BB-47E1-A3D3-0060909475B3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The colonial carnivalesque in Mulk Raj Anand&amp;acirc;??s
