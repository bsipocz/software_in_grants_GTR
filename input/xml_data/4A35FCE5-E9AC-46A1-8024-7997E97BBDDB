Officials at the local, provincial and federal level responded by initiating processes to identify those killed. These processes to identify the missing, however, are not apolitical, but involve a network of actors, expertise, technologies and practices. As key decisions are made - such as what does or does not constitute evidence, who has the authority to speak, what constitutes remains, and when to close an investigation - a series of decisions are made with social and political consequences.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p>As the first anniversary approaches, this study will map the networks and practices that were enacted during the identification process at Lac Megantic. Comparing, contrasting and connecting these practices to UK and international standards in investigation procedures and forensic science, this study will make a direct contribution to the development of UK and international policy with implications for the social welfare of communities affected by disaster and conflict in the UK and internationally.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential non-academic beneficiaries and users:

- The UK Government and specifically the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS), the lead government department for disaster preparedness in the UK (see attached Letter of Support);
- The UK Disaster Victim Identification (UK DVI) team, co-funded by the Home Office and the College of Policing and is also a key gatekeeper for the project; 
- UK HM Coroner, a powerful stakeholder in decision making about how the DVI process is activated;
- Disaster Action, a UK charity that support bereaved families during and after the DVI process; and
- The INTERPOL Disaster Victim Identification Steering Group.

Research Relevance for non-academic beneficiaries and users

This project presents an urgent opportunity to make a direct contribution to the development of UK DVI policy. The case study, Framework of Understanding (FOU) and accompanying training material that will be produced will allow for a much deeper understanding of how complex and challenging a disaster can be to a society, which is vital for the informing of future governmental responses to such incidents. 

The investigators work regularly with these key users who are anticipating the final products: the FOU, the Case Study and an explanatory powerpoint presentation for trainers. These key users have been involved in the design of the project, its ethical aspects, the pathways to impact, and dissemination strategies, particularly with respect to access to the responding organizations and facilities, and concerning the utility of the research for the communities and families affected by disaster.

These key users will also be involved in consulting on the draft FOU and in helping to disseminate this work to wider audiences through presentations, training and online and publication (the outputs will be adopted as part of the UK National Recovery Guidance pages, Cabinet Office Emergency Planning College 'Knowledge Hub&amp;quot; (The UK repository for emergency management material) and Disaster Action. 

This work will therefore directly re-shape current DVI practices and directly influence the way that new planning is undertaken, in the UK and internationally. In this very targeted and skilled area, this work will have a direct impact by changing organisational practice and re-shaping public policy with implications for the social welfare of communities affected by disaster across the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56368</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>To inform UK DVI policy

To accompany this we have developed a training package which is available and hosted by the Cabinet Office Emergency Planning College.
We have provided a case study.
The final report and detailed findings will be submitted on the 30th April 2016.
