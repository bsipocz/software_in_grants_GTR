The accuracy of this distribution process, termed chromosome segregation, is clearly vital since mistakes will result in chromosome loss in one daughter cell and gain chromosome gain in the other. Cells therefore have evolved mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of this process. The chromosomes are segregated to the two daughter cells by becoming attached to molecular cables, termed microtubules, that eventually pull them in opposite directions, but if this attachment is incorrect or fails to happen then segregation during division will fail. Cells therefore have mechanisms both to correct the attachment of chromosomes to microtubules when there is a problem, and to delay the cell from trying to divide until all chromosomes are correctly attached. The mechanism that delays cell division in response to incorrectly attached chromosomes it is present in all higher organisms and much of the work leading to our current understanding of the checkpoint mechanism has been carried out in yeast, a model organism that is used for investigating fundamental questions concerning how cells function. We have been using yeast to investigate the function of a regulatory protein involved in correcting the attachment of chromosomes to microtubules, and discovered that in addition to this function it also provides the signal that delays division while the correction process occurs. However, whereas until now the main factor demonstrated to delay division is the presence of chromosomes that are not attached to microtubules, the mechanism we have discovered appears to respond to chromosomes that are attached to microtubules but not subject to pulling forces exerted by them. This is the situation that would prevail if both copies of a chromosome became incorrectly attached to microtubules such that they would subsequently pull them into the same daughter cell. The objectives of our proposed work are therefore to understand how this new mechanism functions, since it may be the major pathway by which cells allow time to correct an important category of incorrectly attached chromosomes. By investigating how this mechanism operates at the molecular level, we will improve our understanding of a fundamental process that ensures the maintenance of genome integrity during cell division and that is relevant to human conditions such as cancer and Down's syndrome, where chromosome loss or gain events play an important role.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>When cells enter mitosis with chromosomes incorrectly attached to the mitotic spindle, the spindle checkpoint delays anaphase. The checkpoint components are conserved and have been studied extensively in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After replication, many sister chromatids pairs become attached to microtubules from one spindle pole (syntelic attachment) and Ipl1p (Aurora B) kinase is required to promote their biorientation so that they can be correctly segregated. We have found that Ipl1p kinase also activates the spindle checkpoint through phosphorylation of the checkpoint protein Mad3p. This novel pathway appears to respond to sister kinetochores that are not under tension from the mitoic spindle rather than unattached kinetochores, so it could be important for delaying anaphase in response to syntelic chromosomes. We propose to investigate how Ipl1p-dependent Mad3p phosphorylation delays anaphase. Firstly, we will use phosphospecific antibodies follow the kinetics of Mad3p phosphorylation by western blot analysis of synchronous yeast cell extracts and test its dependence on the other known checkpoint proteins. Secondly, we will assess the role of the Ipl1p-Mad3p pathway under additional conditions to test more rigorously its generality and its specificity for sensing lack of sister kinetochore tension as opposed to unattached kinetochores. Thirdly, we will make phosphomimetic mutants of Mad3p that should be constitutively activated and use these to probe the mechanisms through which Mad3p phosphorylation functions. Finally, we will examine how Mad3p phosphorylation affects the stability and protein-protein interactions of checkpoint components. We will address the latter question both by co-immune precipitation and using a recently developed method (SILAC), which involves heavy isotopic labelling and mass spectrometry analysis so that the relative abundance of proteins interacting with phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Mad3p can be compared.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>356587</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Seminar: University of Sussex, UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FCDB1493-FC72-4A45-844E-5486D7CDEB42</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited talk including research done on this project entitled &amp;quot;Chromosome bi-orientation and spindle checkpoint activation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae&amp;quot; was given at the University of Sussex, UK on September 30th 2009.

If the two copies do not attach properly to the mitotic apparatus that pulls them apart, mistakes are made such that one cell receives both copies while the other cell receives neither. Correct attachment means that the duplicated copies of each chromosome must be attached to opposite ends of the mitotic spindle, a state called 'chromosome bi-orientation', ensuring that they will be pulled in opposite directions. To help prevent mistakes, cells have a correction mechanism that promotes chromosome bi-orientation and a second mechanism (the 'Spindle Checkpoint') that can delay the onset of chromosome segregation while any chromosomes remain incorrectly attached. 

Cells are thought to monitor when chromosomes are correctly attached through tension exerted on them by the mitotic apparatus. Our research addressed how this tension might be sensed and converted into a signal that delays cell division. We used yeast cells as model experimental system in which to study the checkpoint mechanism, given that the proteins involved all have counterparts in more complex organisms such as ourselves and because many of the fundamental cellular processes involved in cell division are similar in yeast and mammalian cells. Our previous work suggested that lack of tension might trigger phosphorylation (addition of phosphate groups) to Mad3, mediated by a protein (Ipl1) already known to be part of the error correction mechanism that promotes chromosome bi-orientation. Mad3 was known to be an important component of the Spindle Checkpoint mechanism that delays division when chromosomes are incorrectly attached to the mitotic apparatus. 

To test this model we generated reagents ('phosphospecific antibodies') that could specifically detect phosphate groups at the sites on Mad3 that could be phosphorylated by Ipl1. These antibodies could detect phosphorylated Mad3 generated in an in vitro reaction but we were unable to detect Mad3 phosphorylation in yeast cells using these reagents. However, we were able to show that another protein (Bir1), which associates with Ipl1, is involved in the checkpoint mechanism. While Ipl1, Bir1 and Mad3 are clearly all elements in the Spindle Checkpoint mechanism, our results question the role of Mad3 phosphorylation in vivo.

Conversely, we were able to generate phosphospecific antibodies that recognise Dam1, a protein that connects chromosomes to the mitotic apparatus, specifically when phosphorylated by Ipl1. Phosphorylation of Dam1 by Ipl1 forms part of the correction mechanism that promotes chromosome bi-orientation, and we showed that phosphorylation of Dam1 responded as predicted to whether or not duplicated chromosomes were under tension. Thus when tension was relaxed, Dam1 phosphorylation persisted much longer than normal, consistent with its role in promoting turnover of incorrect interactions between chromosomes and the mitotic apparatus. 

We also investigated the emerging idea that Ipl1 function is controlled in part by an enzyme called haspin. This led to the unexpected discovery that yeast haspin plays a role in promoting correct alignment of the mitotic apparatus in the dividing cell, which is clearly important for ensuring accurate segregation of chromosomes between the two daughter cells.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are no immediate uses of this research in non-academic contexts.
