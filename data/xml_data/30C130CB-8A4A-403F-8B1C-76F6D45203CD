The inaccurate words and actions employed by people from one faith origin when thinking of the other frequently reflect attitudes about the other faith and its followers that are inherited from many centuries past. This project, Christian-Muslim Relations 1500-1900, is about these attitudes and the ways in which they were formed and have developed.

The history of relations between Islam and Christianity stretches over 1400 years. Followers of the faiths have lived closely together from the beginning, and have sometimes benefited one another, as in 9th century Baghdad where important works of science and philosophy were translated from Greek into Arabic by Christians for Muslims, though they have more often defamed and attacked one another, as most dramatically in the Crusades in the 12th and 13th centuries, which were seen as representing a Christian attack on Islam. This project seeks to uncover the stages of this history from 1500 to 1900, both to discover what was actually thought and written, and to explore what was taken as the norm about the character and status of the other. It is a continuation of an earlier AHRC-funded project that traced the history from 600 to 1500. It will build on this and take it forward to 1900, and it will explore the records of encounters between Christians and Muslims in all parts of the world. It has two objectives.

The first is to compile a detailed history of all the known writings by Christians and Muslims about and against one another in the period 1500-1900. For this bibliographical history, four teams of specialists, each focusing on a major sector of the world, will bring together accounts of the works written in their sector, commissioning specialists on particular authors, regions and periods to write detailed analytical entries on the works. An entry will include information about the author, the contents of the work, its significance, the main themes within it, and full details about publication and studies written on it. Each entry will in this way contain a comprehensive account of a work, and the compilation into a connected history will place each one in the wider sweep of Christian-Muslim relations. The result, the collaboration of hundreds of scholars, will be a multi-volume history in unprecedented detail of the development of Christian-Muslim relations between 1500 and 1900. It will give readers access to a wide range of information that in the past has been restricted to specialists possessing particular language skills.

The second objective is to use this bibliographical history to trace the main images and attitudes that have gradually become established as the accepted portrayal of the other, lodging in believers' minds and bedevilling efforts to move away from old ways of relating. Either themselves or in collaboration with others, the four project teams will produce thematic studies of attitudes held by Christians and Muslims about one another as they were transmitted through the centuries. In order to do this, they will use the analyses from the bibliographical history of the 1500-1900 years period, and also the history of the 600-1500 year period that has been produced in exactly the same way by the earlier project. The result will be a single or multi-volume history of images and opinions of the other held by Christians and Muslims from the 7th to the 20th century.

The two histories will shed new light on a frequently troubled record. They will open up a new field of enquiry, and will also contribute towards explaining why Christians and Muslims often continue to misunderstand one another today.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Christian-Muslim Relations 1500-1900 will produce a multi-volume bibliographical history of works written by Christians and Muslims against the other faith and about it in the period 1500-1900, and also a thematic history of attitudes that can be traced through the works treated in the bibliographical history. The bibliographical history will be published in a series of four or more printed volumes, and the thematic history in one or more printed volumes. All will be published by E.J. Brill, Leiden: the bibliographical history will appear in the same series as the volumes produced by the earlier AHRC-funded project, Christian-Muslim Relations, a bibliographical history, which covered the period 600-1500; and the thematic history in the series The History of Christian-Muslim Relations (of which the bibliographical history series is a sub-series). Both series will be widely available for purchase, and also through academic and large municipal libraries which subscribe to the series The History of Christian-Muslim Relations.

The bibliographical history is a resource that will primarily benefit researchers in the fields of Christian-Muslim relations, religious history, politics, and cultural studies. It brings together for the first time detailed analytical accounts of all works in Christian-Muslim relations in all the languages employed, and gives information about manuscripts, editions and translations, and studies on them. It is intended to pave the way for intensive research that will link together works in different languages and from different cultures, so that the history of engagements between the faiths can be accurately explored on the basis of what was actually written rather than inherited bias. As the first stage in a detailed history of engagement between the two faiths (the second will complete it from 1900 to the present), it prepares the way for Muslims and Christians in the UK and elsewhere to map the journey they have followed in attempting to understand and approach one another.

The thematic history will build on this bibliographical history for a broader readership. It focuses on a series of themes and attitudes that first emerged in the early centuries of usually hostile meeting between followers of the two faiths on the basis of what was said or implied in their scriptures and interpretations of them, and were developed into normative attitudes as time went on. Obvious among these are Muslim portrayals of Christian beliefs in three gods, and of the Bible as textually corrupt; and Christian portrayals of the Qur'an as a pastiche of the Bible, and of the Prophet Muhammad as a charlatan. Less obvious, though more insidious themes are Muslim opinions of Christians as malicious and irrational, and Christian opinions of Muslims as lascivious and sensually unrestrained. By identifying these and other themes and attitudes, and showing how they become received wisdom as time moves on and are transmitted throughout the world, the thematic history will go some considerable way in providing explanations for such attitudes as Islamophobia among some Westerners, and hostility towards all that is Western among some Muslims.

This thematic history will be of interest to historians and specialists in cultural studies, and also to people who are concerned to expose and dismantle the causes of inter-religious misunderstanding and antagonism. It should inform the thinking of advisers on UK domestic policy, and will be relevant to specialists in international relations. It could usefully also form the basis of books on trends in relations between the faiths for a wider readership, of exhibitions on the history of popular attitudes and misconceptions, and also of radio (and conceivably TV) programmes on attitudes between the two faiths.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>522706</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Starting at 1500, the project has so far progressed to the 17th century, comprehensively covering works written by Christians and Muslims about and against one another throughout the world in the 16th century, and in the 17th century so far the countries of Northern and Eastern Europe, including Russia. Each author and their works are the subject of an analytical entry in the finished output.It will continue through the remainder of Europe, and the rest of the world in the 17th and 18th centuries, ending at 1800 (it continues the history in the period 600-1500, the completed output in five print volumes from a previous AHRC-funded project). 
The project is finding that while in the Islamic world approaches towards Christians remained largely unchanged from earlier centuries, in the Christian world there was increasing obsession with Muslims. This is instanced in the 16th century by Portuguese and Spanish plans to defeat the growing power of the Ottoman Turks both in the Mediterranean and, surprisingly, in the Indian Ocean, and also by increasing Italian interest in Turkish military and social organisation. In the 17th century in Northern and Eastern Europe it can be seen in Polish concerns to expose the untrustworthiness and cruelty of the Turks in war and their moral dissoluteness in peacetime, Russian usage of the Turks as typical opponents of their aspirations to establish Muscovy as a land of pure Christianity and Moscow as the 'Third Rome', and on the English stage a taste for 'Turk plays', of which Shakespeare's 'Othello the Moor' stands as both the supreme and subversive example. 
However, the project is showing that amid the hostility and condemnation, some European authors were open towards Muslims. In 16th century Spain, a few priests looked on inhabitants of areas captured from Muslim rulers as fellow humans who were recipients of divine grace even as Muslims, while some authors achieved a similar insight in 17th century Poland. Throughout lands in direct confrontation with the Ottomans, many authors expressed a grudging admiration for the discipline shown by the enemy armies and the order within their society, while in lands further removed there were active efforts to establish diplomatic and trade links. To this end, Queen Elizabeth I maintained a correspondence with both Moroccan and Turkish rulers.
Interest in Islam and Muslims pervaded numerous areas of European literary and political life, as well as religious attitudes. And it is remarkable that while among Christians the same stances from centuries earlier continued to be repeated, as among Muslims, there were hints of fresh understanding that they were fellow human beings.
Bringing together detailed descriptions and analyses of the works within its scope, accompanied by full listings of publications and studies about them and their authors, CMR provides a resource with unprecedented depth and range. It shows how attitudes between the two religions instigated or informed major political, as well as religious and literary, developments in the early modern era as an all-embracing element of public and private life.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The output provides a sophisticated basis for the analysis of major trends in attitudes, both friendly and hostile, between Christians and Muslims over an extensive period that will eventually lead up to the beginning of the 20th century. It also shows that there was awareness of the religious 'other' in the thought of a surprisingly wide range of leading intellectuals throughout the world, many of whom would not be immediately associated with inter-religious attitudes. It thereby underlines the integral importance of inter-religious consciousness in a wide range of individual and communal intellectual activities, alerting researchers in a range of disciplines of the need to take account of this element, and providing for them a comprehensive resource with which to do so.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C0AB8545-9E53-425C-9812-815B73839F07</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5449e30904bd69.51888670</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C2D27606-885D-49FA-B619-763949930F21</gtr:id><gtr:title>Christian-Muslim Relations.
