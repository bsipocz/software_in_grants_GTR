The key focus of my project is the interplay between gender, ethnicity and social class, which I aim to examine by conducting a comparative analysis of the situated, conversational data from the three groups of girls. \n\nLanguage and gender scholars in the last decade have generated a substantial amount of research which suggests that gender identities are not biologically determined and static, but instead are constructed by (groups of) individuals in everyday interaction. However, despite the substantial body of research in Ango-American speech communities, work on non-white femininities is rare and British Asian girls have so far not been the focus of a language and gender study. Moreover, linguistic studies of social class differences among female adolescents have frequently focused on accent, grammatical or style features, whereas my project conducts its exploration of social class in relation to gender predominantly on a discourse level, aiming to appeal to a larger audience beyond linguists. Finally, studies of girl talk are frequently restricted to one specific socio-cultural context, whereas my research will produce a comparative analysis of discursive practices and identities in girls from different socio-cultural backgrounds. \n\nThe spontaneous conversational data that I will explore in my research is based on the self-recorded talk of three groups of British girls who all attended year 11 at their respective schools (ages 15-17). Groups 1 and 2 studied at a comprehensive school in a working class area of London's East End, whereas the girls in group 3 were from an upper-middle class public school background. Group 1 consists of five British Bangladeshi girls, whereas the girls in the other groups are of predominantly British/white European descent. In order to explore the relationship between local discourse practices and larger-scale socio-cultural norms I also used questionnaires, observations and group interviews to find out more about the girls' friendship groups and socio-cultural backgrounds. My analysis of gender and ethnicity will also examine ethnographic-style interviews with one of the Bangladeshi girls who helped me to translate the Bengali utterances and (re)interpreted some of my material. This collaboration will constitute an original contribution of my work to language and gender methodology, as it will highlight the benefits of encouraging a dialogue between researcher and researched. \n\nMy analysis will draw on a combination of (largely qualitative) frameworks, allowing me to link the exploration of the girls' talk on a discursive level to a micro-linguistic analysis of my data, focusing on identity as a process. Thus, my assessment of the girls' positions in relation to specific discourses as well as their relationship with each other and with people outside the group will be supported by an examination of the structure and organisation of their talk, of lexical choices, and of paralinguistic or nonverbal cues such as their voices and intonation patterns. The three analytical chapters I propose to complete during my AHRC research leave situate my linguistically-oriented discourse analytic approach to gender, social class and ethnicity in a crossdisciplinary research context of adolescent identities, drawing on sociology, cultural studies, anthropology and education. \n\nThis crossdisciplinary and comparative perspective to my investigation of the interplay of language/discourse, gender, ethnicity and social class in the situated friendship talk of white British and Bangladeshi adolescent girls from different social backgrounds aims to give an insight into a variety of young contemporary British femininities, and thus to appeal to awide range of students, academics and practitioners with an interest in gender and adolescents.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16400</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E004636/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BC807E7B-C08E-46F6-9E44-E65554CFBA4B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>67D06C0B-53E4-47FE-8186-CBCE56A1271E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
