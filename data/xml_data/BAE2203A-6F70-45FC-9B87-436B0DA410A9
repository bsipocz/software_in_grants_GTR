However, they have a number of side-effects, including stomach ulcers. Coxibs are newer versions of these drugs with a lower risk of ulcers. Initially coxibs were used widely, but later studies suggested that they cause an increased risk of heart problems. This has led to some coxibs, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), being taken off the market.

Our previous study looking at limited data from all the trials of these medications demonstrated that some NSAIDs cause a similar risk of heart problems to coxibs. However, the overall risk of heart and stomach problems for NSAIDs and coxibs remains unclear. Given their widespread use, it is important that reliable information about the overall effects of these drugs is available. We plan to extend our study, using much more detailed data from each of the randomised trials, and looking at both heart and stomach complications. This will help to establish the overall effects of each coxib and NSAID in different scenarios, allowing doctors and patients to understand the risks and benefits of both of these widely used medications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are amongst the most commonly prescribed pain-killers worldwide, but they cause serious gastrointestinal side effects, including life-threatening bleeding from gastroduodenal ulcers. A new drug class-the selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs)-was developed in order to reduce the risk of such side-effects, but these drugs have been found to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart attacks, resulting in several of these agents (including Vioxx&amp;reg;) being withdrawn from the market. 

The CTSU obtained agreement from each of the coxib manufacturers (Merck, Pfizer and Novartis) to provide tabular data from each trial comparing a coxib versus placebo or a coxib versus a traditional NSAID, and performed a meta-analysis of tabular data on major cardiovascular outcomes. This meta-analysis, published in the BMJ in 2006, involved 145,000 participants in 138 trials, and it confirmed that coxibs approximately double the incidence of heart attacks, but also demonstrated that coxibs and some high-dose NSAIDs regimens (ibuprofen and diclofenac, but not naproxen) have similar cardiovascular risks to coxibs.

This meta-analysis, though helping to establish the cardiovascular effects of coxibs and NSAIDs, was limited in its scope because it involved only summary data. It was not able to explore the consistency of the relative hazard among particular patient subgroups, effects on particular vascular outcomes (e.g. haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke), or how soon the hazard emerges after treatment starts. More importantly, it did not examine the gastrointestinal effects of coxibs and NSAIDs. 

In order to address these questions we have obtained agreement from each of the companies to provide more detailed individual patient data from each trial previously provided (as well as any new ones that are eligible). The primary analyses will be of a coxib versus placebo, or a coxib versus and NSAID and, indirectly, of an NSAI versus placebo. The primary outcomes will be vascular events (heart attack, stroke, or vascular death) and gastrointestinal complications (perforation, obstruction or bleed), and secondary outcomes will include specific vascular and gastrointestinal events. Analyses will, wherever possible, be intention-to-treat, using standard analytical methods for combining survival data from randomised trials, and using sensitivity analyses to explore the possible effects of non-compliance on estimates of treatment effects.

This meta-analysis should provide uniquely reliable data on the net effects of coxibs and NSAIDs, and will help to address the current therapeutic uncertainty about which pain relief strategies are appropriate at different levels of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234399</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>E75BAFB2-EB5F-4EEF-945B-15DD87E23B6F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As above.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>745D00D1C3E-5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The main role of the Steering Committee, which comprises many of the key trialists and experts in this field, is to advise the CNT Collaboration Secretariat on design, logistics &amp;amp; analyses - members also help to ensure the participation of stakeholders.

A meta-analysis of tabular data from randomised trials of at least 4 weeks' duration involving a coxib versus placebo, or a coxib versus a traditional NSAID, has provided some limited information about the risk of vascular events associated with these drugs.
