define stratified medicine tools for childhood inflammatory arthritis</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/M004600/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Arthritis (swelling, pain and inflammation of the joints) affects 1 in 1000 children and young people. Arthritis of children and young people is called juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). If JIA is not fully treated it causes severe pain, joint restriction swelling and stiffness, fatigue, poor growth, thinning of bones, time off school, reduced social and sporting activities and lost family life opportunities. JIA can lead to major disability that lasts well into adult life. There are many modern, powerful medicines that can be used to treat JIA better than before. However we do not yet have reliable and child-friendly tests that can predict which drug will work best for each child. Each of these drugs may also have serious side effects. At the moment, children and young people (and their families) have to wait after starting a new drug to see if it works, and whether any important side effects happen. If it does not work, or side effects crop up, only then are they allowed to try another. This &amp;quot;lets try it and see&amp;quot; approach takes time and exposes children to drugs which might not work well, yet often have important short and long term side effects. 

Therefore there is an urgent need to develop ways that can help to predict how an individual child will respond to each drug, and so allow children with JIA to be treated with the most appropriate medicine. This approach is now known as 'precision' or 'stratified' medicine. Early control of the arthritis allows children to return to their education, as well as full sporting and family life activities, whilst continued control of arthritis prevents disability and avoids lost opportunities in the long-term.

At the moment, four major UK studies are collecting valuable data about response to treatment from children and young people with JIA across the country. Between them, these studies have a lot of data, both clinical as well as laboratory data, that can address this need. In this partnership we propose to bring these studies together to form a unique Consortium, called the Childhood Arthritis Response to Treatment Consortium (CHART). CHART will work with all the main national and international stakeholders including clinical and research collaborators, as well as families and patients who lives are affected by JIA. The overall aim of CHART is to directly improve clinical care for children with arthritis. 

The key aspects of the work planned in the CHART Consortium are to : 
1. Find out exactly what data and samples are already available in the four major UK studies of JIA 
2. Design and agree a way to share all of the data, and bring the data together 
3. Agree to collect data and samples for understanding response to treatment in the same way in the future, in order to speed up progress for all children with JIA
4. Give many more children and families the opportunity to contribute to these studies by including new centres and collaborators

The CHART Consortium, if established, will be one of the largest of its kind in the world. The CHART researchers will have the common goal of making treatment of JIA more individualised and precise, to help every child with arthritis return to a full normal life as quickly as possible.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The primary goal of this partnership is to create the Childhood Arthritis Response to Treatment consortium (CHART), which aims to improve directly the clinical care of children with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), by bringing together the major ongoing UK studies of JIA treatment response, and includes patients/families affected by JIA, as well as clinicians and researchers from across the UK, in order to develop a robust platform that will enable a stratified approach to treatment interventions in JIA. 

Predictors of response to medication to inform treatment stratification are much needed in JIA. Unopposed joint inflammation in non-responsive patients is associated with increased disability, and creates personal / economic burden for many years into adult life. Currently no validated biomarkers exist that can identify children who will fail to respond, or whose disease is resistant to either methotrexate or biologic agents. CHART will bring together existing large JIA cohort studies, key stakeholders (scientists, clinicians, patients and families), and their collaborative infrastructure and networks, to work together.

The specific objectives of the CHART consortium, during this partnership are to: 
1. Evaluate the clinical data and sample protocols in the currently available JIA cohort studies
2. Collate and align the data available within a common platform
3. Define and agree standardised 'core' clinical dataset, response outcome measures, sample protocols and IT for going forward
4. Expand and extend the existing cohorts by inclusion of cases from existing and new centres, using the agreed common standardised core data set and protocols

The creation of the Consortium, generation of the large combined JIA dataset in a single platform, and agreement of harmonised data and sample collection protocols, will ensure that the Consortium is ideally placed to obtain future funding to achieve our longterm goals of stratified medicine for JIA.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Several groups of stakeholders will benefit directly from this research, as follows: 
Academia: the academic beneficiaries of this work will be those directly involved in the Consortium from 3 Universities, and importantly also all those who contribute to the Consortium (basic, translational and clinical researchers in the field of children and young people's arthritis) as well as other collaborators with a focus on stratified medicine, pharmacogenomics, life course research and e-health research. 
While initially focused in engaging colleagues from right across the UK, in the future the Consortium will be well placed to partner with parallel efforts from across the world (Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation PRINTO, the Understanding Childhood Arthritis Network UCAN, the Childhood Arthritis &amp;amp; Rheumatology Research Alliance CARRA, Paediatric Rheumatology European Society, and Pharmachild, Long-term Pharmacovigilance for Adverse effects in Childhood arthritis focusing on Immune modulatory drugs Network). Benefit will come both through new knowledge gained, the accessibility of methods samples and data, through the study Steering Committee and extrapolation of new knowledge to related fields.

Public sector/NHS/policy makers: the efficient bringing together of studies to share data and work to propose methods with which to predict response to treatment in JIA, will benefit the NHS and reduce the economic burden of JIA to society. Accurate stratification of JIA patients using biomarkers would reduce uncontrolled disease, so enable HCPs to keep children out of hospital, reduce time of school and absence from work for parents caring for children with JIA. The availability of validated stratified medicine care pathways would greatly improve management of JIA so benefitting care providers, commissioners and policy makers.

Patients/public/schools: A central aim of CHART is to widen the inclusion of research studies on stratified medicine to all children with JIA, by generating simple, practical, and agreed protocols, that could be incorporated into routine clinical care. The uncertainty of response when a new drug is first tried causes worry and anxiety for many families, and serial failure of drugs in resistant cases represents a considerable added burden for parents dealing with the complexities of a chronically ill child. In addition better precision of treatment will reduce exposure to side effects from ineffective medications and reduce need for concomitant medications such as steroids, which leave long-term damage in growing children. With wide dissemination of results, all patients with JIA (the ~15000 in the UK and many more beyond) and their families would benefit from progress towards a stratified approach to treating JIA.

Charities and funders: several charities and industry partners have already funded the studies participating in this proposal, for several years. Notably, the contributions from Arthritis Research UK (CAPS, BCRD studies), SPARKS UK (CHARMS study) and Pfizer (BSPAR-Etanercept study), have all been significant. These agencies will benefit from the coherent approach gained by joining efforts between these studies and will be acknowledged in literature resulting from the project.

 - CAPTURE JIA data dictionary to work towards a core common data set for use in EPR in every day care across the UK .

- CHART harmonised data dictionary and clinical data set 

- CAPTURE JIA is now applying for further funding to pilot the dataset for implementation in hospitals across the UK

Update for 2016/7 submission:
CAPTURE JIA received ethics and HRA approval for a pilot study in UK hospitals (Nov 2016.)The CAPTURE-JIA forms have been designed to follow the flow of the clinical consultation.The data dictionary defines each data item. These forms provide a standardized clinical and research data collection across the UK.
The aims of the pilot study are to develop, pilot and test a Microsoft Word proforma to collect CAPTURE-JIA data items in 'real world' clinical practice, ensuring that CAPTURE-JIA is ready for adoption nationwide. We envisage that our proposed qualitative approach, including stakeholder-led proforma modification, will enable stakeholder engagement ('buy in'), and will inform guidance on use of CAPTURE-JIA in the clinical setting.The CAPTURE-JIA dataset will foster collaborative and effective working, benchmarking of clinical services against quality indicators, and aligning treatment strategies and clinical research opportunities, with the aim of improving clinical care for CYP with JIA in the UK. The CAPTURE JIA dataset thereby has worked closely with the CHART project due to overarching aims of standardisation across UK JIA research, collecting the right data at the right time and in the right way to maximise clinical benefit, but also enrich JIA research studies by improving data collection nationally and to enable more effective cross-cohort sharing in the future, beyond the four key CHART partner studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d8436f143946.35216038-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>CAPTURE JIA project has been led by the University of Manchester, acquiring funding and running meetings with stakeholder's from across the UK to finalize a proposed dataset that was developed from UoM analysis of all parties recommendations.

2016/7 submission
CMG has partnered with new collaborators to develop the CLUSTER consortium bid to which the CHART sample and data alignment and partnership forms a solid foundation.
After completion of the data dictionary, CMG has secured some staff time of Janssen, QMUL, bioinformatists and datascientists based at the University of Manchester data dictionary to agree setting up CHART TRANSMART at Manchester with a pilot data set now uploaded. CMG has also overseen the development of the CHART biospecimen catalogue and CHART Lab SOPs comparison. CMG has ensured all year 2 milestone tasks (as per GANTT chart) have been achieved. We have already achieved some of the year 3 milestones, with the next key ones for completion being the final TRANSMART set up process to incorporate the CHARMS data with the other 3 study datasets and beginning the ethical amendment process on the four key partner studies to enable to the collection of new samples and data, and more systematic data-sharing..

2. Information gained will inform development of the CHART data dictionary for prospective data collection.
3. Information gained will inform common methodologies for future data collection

Update for 2016 - 2017 submission: the QW Group completed its data mapping to produce a final CHART data dictionary which lists the items identified as part of an agreed core stratified medicine dataset for CHART. The data dictionary lists the proposed &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; coding for each item in the CHART TRANSMART hub. This 'gold standard' set fed into the CAPTURE JIA standardized set (see entry in collaborations) and vice versa. In 2016 - 2017 data scientists in Manchester have been working to create scripts for each data item for 3 of the 4 CHART studies to translate each item from their current formats in the respective study databases into the format specified for the CHART TRANSMART system.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5559b649886946.56630578-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Gillian Armitt created a mind map to show all the data items collected in the five large cohort studies in JIA (BCRD, BSPAR-Etanercept, CAPS and CHARMS; also JIA-GCUK though this will not be considered further). The mind map includes domains such as: Timepoints/Demographics (gender, ethnicity, age of onset, ILAR sub-type)/Outcomes (Core Outcome Variables; other outcomes).
Gillian Armitt has been in control of the documentation for the group, and has recorded minutes etc.
Clare Heard (UCL) and Gillian Armitt have presented executive summaries of the QW progress at CMG meetings, and together formed a 'Gold Standard' for all data items to be presented as part of the CAPTURE JIA Meeting in May 2015.
The other study coordinators have contributed to the work by summarising and completing tables reflecting data collection/recording for each of the data items in their corresponding studies, to form large comparison tables which the group worked then together to produce executive summaries.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The CHART QW Working group comprised: Project Manager: Gillian Armitt (Manchester) /Clare Heard (UCL), + the study coordinators from each of the 4 partner studies (BCRD - Katy Mowbray/ BSPAR-Et - Emily Sutton/ CAPS - Andrew Smith/ CHARMS - Clare Heard) + clinical representatives (Dr Sunil Sampath - Manchester) and Manchester Unit Data dictionary team representatives (Kamilla Kopec Harding, Mauro Tutini.) The CHART QW Group reports directly to the CHART Management Group (headed by CHART PI Lucy Wedderburn) via Clare Heard.
The purpose of the overarching CHART project, of which this project forms part, is to increase the statistical power for analysis of data from studies in JIA, by being able to combine data across studies. The purpose of the QW project is to contribute to the above by:
1. identifying data items in the BCRD, BSPAR-Etanercept, CAPS and CHARMS studies that are effectively the same ('quick wins'). 'Effectively the same' means that: their intended meaning is the same; although the data format may differ, formats are sufficiently similar to allow the data to be readily combined.
2. to capture a list of data items requiring more work to understand their relationship, i.e. whether they are effectively the same or are different.

- CHART harmonised data dictionary and clinical data set 

- CAPTURE JIA is now applying for further funding to pilot the dataset for implementation in hospitals across the UK

Update for 2016/7 submission:
CAPTURE JIA received ethics and HRA approval for a pilot study in UK hospitals (Nov 2016.)The CAPTURE-JIA forms have been designed to follow the flow of the clinical consultation.The data dictionary defines each data item. These forms provide a standardized clinical and research data collection across the UK.
The aims of the pilot study are to develop, pilot and test a Microsoft Word proforma to collect CAPTURE-JIA data items in 'real world' clinical practice, ensuring that CAPTURE-JIA is ready for adoption nationwide. We envisage that our proposed qualitative approach, including stakeholder-led proforma modification, will enable stakeholder engagement ('buy in'), and will inform guidance on use of CAPTURE-JIA in the clinical setting.The CAPTURE-JIA dataset will foster collaborative and effective working, benchmarking of clinical services against quality indicators, and aligning treatment strategies and clinical research opportunities, with the aim of improving clinical care for CYP with JIA in the UK. The CAPTURE JIA dataset thereby has worked closely with the CHART project due to overarching aims of standardisation across UK JIA research, collecting the right data at the right time and in the right way to maximise clinical benefit, but also enrich JIA research studies by improving data collection nationally and to enable more effective cross-cohort sharing in the future, beyond the four key CHART partner studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d8436f143946.35216038-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>CAPTURE JIA project has been led by the University of Manchester, acquiring funding and running meetings with stakeholder's from across the UK to finalize a proposed dataset that was developed from UoM analysis of all parties recommendations.

Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust; co-lead: Professor W Thomson, University of Manchester. An outline bid was submitted to the MRC Stratified medicine call, which has now been invited to proceed to a full application. CLUSTER will include multi-disciplinary expertise in clinical, molecular, genetic, and immunological deep phenotyping, statistics, bioinformatics, and stratified medicine, UK leaders in paediatric rheumatology and ophthalmology, and those designing and delivering clinical trials in JIA and its associated uveitis. The overall goal of CLUSTER is to define 'endotypes' (or 'strata') of childhood arthritis and JIA-uveitis, with associated prognostic biomarkers of treatment response and disease course, and integrate these to generate stratification algorithms to facilitate targeted treatment decisions, leading to earlier effective control of inflammation, improved outcomes, reduced exposure to side effects from ineffective therapy and long term health care savings.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Harvard University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Harvard Medical School</gtr:department><gtr:description>London Declaration of Principles of Research Collaboration for Stratified Medicine in Childhood Rheumatic Disorders (2016)</gtr:description><gtr:id>D9BCD51A-4E4E-4296-87E6-0302C21F693C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work on a toolkit as part of this collaboration is ongoing.

An outline bid was submitted to the MRC Stratified medicine call, which has now been invited to proceed to a full application. CLUSTER will include multi-disciplinary expertise in clinical, molecular, genetic, and immunological deep phenotyping, statistics, bioinformatics, and stratified medicine, UK leaders in paediatric rheumatology and ophthalmology, and those designing and delivering clinical trials in JIA and its associated uveitis. The overall goal of CLUSTER is to define 'endotypes' (or 'strata') of childhood arthritis and JIA-uveitis, with associated prognostic biomarkers of treatment response and disease course, and integrate these to generate stratification algorithms to facilitate targeted treatment decisions, leading to earlier effective control of inflammation, improved outcomes, reduced exposure to side effects from ineffective therapy and long term health care savings.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>PRECEDE study</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA263034-FE1F-412B-9EEC-AF64E52A6881</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Finalised study protocol,

CMG has partnered with new collaborators to develop the CLUSTER consortium bid to which the CHART sample and data alignment and partnership forms a solid foundation.
After completion of the data dictionary, CMG has secured some staff time of Janssen, QMUL, bioinformatists and datascientists based at the University of Manchester data dictionary to agree setting up CHART TRANSMART at Manchester with a pilot data set now uploaded. CMG has also overseen the development of the CHART biospecimen catalogue and CHART Lab SOPs comparison. CMG has ensured all year 2 milestone tasks (as per GANTT chart) have been achieved. We have already achieved some of the year 3 milestones, with the next key ones for completion being the final TRANSMART set up process to incorporate the CHARMS data with the other 3 study datasets and beginning the ethical amendment process on the four key partner studies to enable to the collection of new samples and data, and more systematic data-sharing.. Analyses and clinical predicting modelling on this data has already been undertaken at Manchester through the clinical fellowship with Dr. Sunil Sampath (also listed under collaborations.)

 - CAPTURE JIA data dictionary to work towards a core common data set for use in EPR in every day care across the UK .

- CHART harmonised data dictionary and clinical data set 

- CAPTURE JIA is now applying for further funding to pilot the dataset for implementation in hospitals across the UK

Update for 2016/7 submission:
CAPTURE JIA received ethics and HRA approval for a pilot study in UK hospitals (Nov 2016.)The CAPTURE-JIA forms have been designed to follow the flow of the clinical consultation.The data dictionary defines each data item. These forms provide a standardized clinical and research data collection across the UK.
The aims of the pilot study are to develop, pilot and test a Microsoft Word proforma to collect CAPTURE-JIA data items in 'real world' clinical practice, ensuring that CAPTURE-JIA is ready for adoption nationwide. We envisage that our proposed qualitative approach, including stakeholder-led proforma modification, will enable stakeholder engagement ('buy in'), and will inform guidance on use of CAPTURE-JIA in the clinical setting.The CAPTURE-JIA dataset will foster collaborative and effective working, benchmarking of clinical services against quality indicators, and aligning treatment strategies and clinical research opportunities, with the aim of improving clinical care for CYP with JIA in the UK. The CAPTURE JIA dataset thereby has worked closely with the CHART project due to overarching aims of standardisation across UK JIA research, collecting the right data at the right time and in the right way to maximise clinical benefit, but also enrich JIA research studies by improving data collection nationally and to enable more effective cross-cohort sharing in the future, beyond the four key CHART partner studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d8436f143946.35216038-5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>CAPTURE JIA project has been led by the University of Manchester, acquiring funding and running meetings with stakeholder's from across the UK to finalize a proposed dataset that was developed from UoM analysis of all parties recommendations.

 - CAPTURE JIA data dictionary to work towards a core common data set for use in EPR in every day care across the UK .

- CHART harmonised data dictionary and clinical data set 

- CAPTURE JIA is now applying for further funding to pilot the dataset for implementation in hospitals across the UK

Update for 2016/7 submission:
CAPTURE JIA received ethics and HRA approval for a pilot study in UK hospitals (Nov 2016.)The CAPTURE-JIA forms have been designed to follow the flow of the clinical consultation.The data dictionary defines each data item. These forms provide a standardized clinical and research data collection across the UK.
The aims of the pilot study are to develop, pilot and test a Microsoft Word proforma to collect CAPTURE-JIA data items in 'real world' clinical practice, ensuring that CAPTURE-JIA is ready for adoption nationwide. We envisage that our proposed qualitative approach, including stakeholder-led proforma modification, will enable stakeholder engagement ('buy in'), and will inform guidance on use of CAPTURE-JIA in the clinical setting.The CAPTURE-JIA dataset will foster collaborative and effective working, benchmarking of clinical services against quality indicators, and aligning treatment strategies and clinical research opportunities, with the aim of improving clinical care for CYP with JIA in the UK. The CAPTURE JIA dataset thereby has worked closely with the CHART project due to overarching aims of standardisation across UK JIA research, collecting the right data at the right time and in the right way to maximise clinical benefit, but also enrich JIA research studies by improving data collection nationally and to enable more effective cross-cohort sharing in the future, beyond the four key CHART partner studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d8436f143946.35216038-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>CAPTURE JIA project has been led by the University of Manchester, acquiring funding and running meetings with stakeholder's from across the UK to finalize a proposed dataset that was developed from UoM analysis of all parties recommendations.

 - CAPTURE JIA data dictionary to work towards a core common data set for use in EPR in every day care across the UK .

- CHART harmonised data dictionary and clinical data set 

- CAPTURE JIA is now applying for further funding to pilot the dataset for implementation in hospitals across the UK

Update for 2016/7 submission:
CAPTURE JIA received ethics and HRA approval for a pilot study in UK hospitals (Nov 2016.)The CAPTURE-JIA forms have been designed to follow the flow of the clinical consultation.The data dictionary defines each data item. These forms provide a standardized clinical and research data collection across the UK.
The aims of the pilot study are to develop, pilot and test a Microsoft Word proforma to collect CAPTURE-JIA data items in 'real world' clinical practice, ensuring that CAPTURE-JIA is ready for adoption nationwide. We envisage that our proposed qualitative approach, including stakeholder-led proforma modification, will enable stakeholder engagement ('buy in'), and will inform guidance on use of CAPTURE-JIA in the clinical setting.The CAPTURE-JIA dataset will foster collaborative and effective working, benchmarking of clinical services against quality indicators, and aligning treatment strategies and clinical research opportunities, with the aim of improving clinical care for CYP with JIA in the UK. The CAPTURE JIA dataset thereby has worked closely with the CHART project due to overarching aims of standardisation across UK JIA research, collecting the right data at the right time and in the right way to maximise clinical benefit, but also enrich JIA research studies by improving data collection nationally and to enable more effective cross-cohort sharing in the future, beyond the four key CHART partner studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d8436f143946.35216038-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>CAPTURE JIA project has been led by the University of Manchester, acquiring funding and running meetings with stakeholder's from across the UK to finalize a proposed dataset that was developed from UoM analysis of all parties recommendations.

CLUSTER will include multi-disciplinary expertise in clinical, molecular, genetic, and immunological deep phenotyping, statistics, bioinformatics, and stratified medicine, UK leaders in paediatric rheumatology and ophthalmology, and those designing and delivering clinical trials in JIA and its associated uveitis. The overall goal of CLUSTER is to define 'endotypes' (or 'strata') of childhood arthritis and JIA-uveitis, with associated prognostic biomarkers of treatment response and disease course, and integrate these to generate stratification algorithms to facilitate targeted treatment decisions, leading to earlier effective control of inflammation, improved outcomes, reduced exposure to side effects from ineffective therapy and long term health care savings.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University Hospital of North Norway</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Norway, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>PRECEDE study</gtr:description><gtr:id>BE3057FB-2327-4E41-8066-1631275C2EAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Finalised study protocol,

The concept of the meeting, co-hosted by CHART and UCAN-U (Utrecht), is to bring together key international scientists, clinicians and experts working in clinical and translational fields of stratified medicine for juvenile idiopathic arthritis who would like to further collaborate and devise ways to speed progress in this area. 
The overarching goals of the meeting were:
? Facilitate new collaborations between existing researchers to enable meta analyses, validation studies, new studies and/or new grant applications. 
? Reach consensus on the harmonisation of standard operating procedures for the collection and processing of biological samples 
? Examine and look to overcome the barriers to data sharing to accelerate the pace of understanding of heterogeneity and drug response in JIA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d8623aa1a409.43690755</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>LW UCAN-A Consensus Conference Singapore - Feb 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6987C551-AC6B-45EC-BFA6-DB15C7034351</gtr:id><gtr:impact>LW was invited to attend this consensus conferences for the development of a new research network through Asia - UCAN-A (Understanding Childhood Chronic Aliments Network - Asia) The objectives of the meeting were to define standard operating procedures for the design of translational research project for the diagnosis, intervention and collection of samples and clinical data over the network.

- Hold workshops to reach consensus on common core data set 
- Agree common clinical data set going forward
CAPTURE JIA is supported by the CHART &amp;quot;Quick Win&amp;quot; working group, organised and headed by LW/CH/GA, completing the CHART task of evaluating the clinical data available in the current studies, proposing a gold standard dataset to be considered at the JIA Core Dataset meeting.
CAPTURE JIA met the following important targets:
- Developing a single unified standardised core dataset for JIA that takes into account heterogeneity of purpose (clinical care, NHS Commissioning, National Audit, patient/family perspective, clinical research) in dialogue/agreement with international practitioners and experts in the JIA field
- To improve patient care and provide a sustainable source or research-quality data that can be combined across multiple clinical sites, thus increasing power and momentum in JIA research worldwide.

By completing the pre-meeting Delphi, and rating 80 proposed data items for collection at all JIA consultations, these were taken into the final consideration and debate. Able to assist and guide the debate as a representative of CHART.

- Profile of CHART was raised in a national clinical audience
- Long-term effects will be as outlined in the targets above.
- Changed perspectives on importance of collecting a quality and standard dataset at all JIA patient consultations and the impact of this on patient care and translational research across the UK</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5559aa36390be7.17972396</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ARUK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology at UCL, GOSH and UCLH, Young Persons Focus Groups</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D9A33713-5BBE-49FC-AD2F-56B79F5F08E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have held a series of PPIE/E meetings and focus groups at which young people with JIA have advised on research and projects as well as new grant applications as they are prepared.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c94a7f8c1051.47172918</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>JIA Pathogenesis: What we have understood so far (PReS Conference, Genoa Sept 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9135B8CC-D3E8-4577-8BFD-E751D09A9FF5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society on JIA Pathogenesis as part of a session on 'Immune Aspects of JIA.'

This work has enabled us to lead the production of a comprehensive data dictionary for JIA research studies, to include a 'gold standard' suggestion for how to most effectively collect each data item. This is a standard which we could then propose to new JIA studies in the future (once the consortium is in a position to expand) to enable even greater data sharing across research studies. The key aspiration is for all children with JIA in the UK to have the opportunity to be a part of this consortium.

The CHART Consortium is also developing models for the combination/harmonization of the 4 current studies - i.e. options of developing a joint data platform etc.

The CHART consortium has begun entering pilot datasets into a TRANSMART platform for preliminary script testing. Work to upload datasets from the three studies for alignment within TRANSMART is now underway, and is almost complete for 3/4 studies.

This work provided key data and information to a National initiative, CAPTURE JIA ( see collaborations) , part of a HQIP project, which aims to generate a minimal core dataset for use in clinical practice in JIA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54ef4048829a18.24647431</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>CHART Consortium TRANSMART Data Platform (updated for 2016/7)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Cohort of 1250 patients with JIA in whom data and biological material has been collected , with information about response to treatment</gtr:description><gtr:id>51CC5708-99B6-4266-A76F-207DC83A9DA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Many papers- see publications list; further funding ; proposal for a UK wide Consortium ( CHART)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>aFrgduKw2WX</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>SPARKS CHARMS database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Harmonisation and alignment of clinical datasets form existing JAI Cohort studies across the UK
