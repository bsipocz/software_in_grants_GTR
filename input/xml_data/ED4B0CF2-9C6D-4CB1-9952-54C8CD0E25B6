We are looking at several aspects of recovery. Recovery from coma, for example, can be observed at the behavioural level; and the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (Shiel et al 2001) is a useful tool for doing this. Changes within the brain can be observed using more direct measures of brain activity such as imaging through PET or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We are determining whether behavioural changes and changes within the brain proceed together or whether one occurs prior to the other. We have established that about 75% of people with low levels of awareness show a wider range of behaviours when they are stood upright in a standing frame. We are following up an group of people seen initially when they were in coma or a low level of awareness. We also hope to determine whether stimulating people in coma will affect the brain by increasing blood flow and whether it will lead to behavioural changes. After coma, people are typically in a confused and disoriented state. This period is known as Post Traumatic Amnesia (PTA). We are looking at recovery from PTA and developing a new test to monitor such recovery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>1. General Aims: Relevance: Health Issues. The aim of this project is to determine the degree to which early behaviours, in the first few weeks or months following severe head injury, predict later behaviours. 2. Precise Scientific Objectives. One project is using bispectral EEG to determine whether changes in coherent frequency correspond to key changes in behaviour during coma and upon emergence from coma. A concurrent study is a functional imaging study investigating correspondences between specific changes in regional cerebral blood flow as assessed by PET and behavioural changes on emergence from coma. Twenty four patients have been recruited to these two studies so far. We are also following up this group of patients two years after their recruitment into the study. Twelve have been seen to date of whom 8 are still in a low level of awareness. We are trying to get funding for a study to assess the effect of intensive sensory stimulation on regional perfusion and behavioural changes in patients who are in the vegetative state. We have been using the Wessex Head Injury Matrix to compare performance of vegetative and minimally conscious patients when they are supine and when they are standing . Work on recovery from post traumatic amnesia continues and we are developing a new test to monitor recovery from PTA. 3. Plan of investigation. Patients are seen and assessed with PET or fMRI together with behavioural measures (the WHIM) and physiological measures. Performance on separate occasions are compared. 4. Subsequent Scientific/Medical Opportunities. The value of this research for health care is to provide a clearer understanding of the process of recovery from severe head injury and to link behavioural recovery with actual changes seen in the brain. This clearer understanding is expected to lead to: a) more realistic expectations about the extent of likely improvement; b) better measures to identify change; andc) possible methods to determine the effectiveness of treatment.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1998-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>241573</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U105559855</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>878A242A-6B84-462E-BEA5-346583F6CA54</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.2  Psychological and socioeconomic processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>2472941E-25F2-45EC-A735-3C0872CE6B26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.3  Psychological, social and economic factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
