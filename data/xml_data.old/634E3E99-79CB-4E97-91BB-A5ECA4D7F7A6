We and others have identified that the adult heart possesses stem cells, called cardiac stem cells, and my laboratory has shown that these stem cells have the unique potential to regenerate lost heart tissue following damage. The goal of my research is to design the best, most cost-effective and easy-to-apply protocols and interventions for treating patients by regenerating and repairing the heart tissue that has been lost. 

We have discovered substances secreted by the cardiac stem cells that stimulate their growth and ability to make new heart tissue. We have also discovered that stem cells derived from the heart have a unique ability to return to the damaged heart, if injected through the circulation. The aim of this project is to define the biology of cardiac stem cells derived from human myocardium. We will test their stability when propagated to large numbers of cells in culture. We will determine their ability to return to the damaged heart when injected through the circulation and we will determine the substances that the human cardiac stem cells secrete when they reach the heart. Finally, we will determine whether the human cardiac stem cells can stimulate repair and regeneration of the damaged heart, leading to improved heart function. It is envisioned that the results from this project will lead to the first in man clinical trial where human cardiac stem cells are injected into patients who have suffered a heart attack in an attempt to repair and regenerate heart cells and improve outcome.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The adult myocardium, including human, harbours multi-potent cardiac stem cells (CSCs), which give rise to new cardiomyocytes and vasculature. We can efficiently isolate CSCs from human, pig, mouse and rat hearts and clonally-derive and expand at least 1 x 1011 from a single CSC. When administered systemically, clonal CSCs have a natural homing capacity to the damaged heart. Moreover, CSCs secrete a repertoire of pro-survival and regenerative growth factors, which mediates a 'paracrine' effect on the recipient's myocardium including activating the endogenous, resident CSCs. The proposed allogeneic CSC therapy is conceptually and practically different from any presently in clinical use. The approach is a modulated form of growth factor therapy, where the cells naturally home to the damaged myocardium, deliver a complex mixture of growth factors, which elicit a 'paracrine' effect and activate the endogenous target regenerative cells within a short time frame of 1-2 days. In this project, we will assess the phenotypic and genomic stability of human CSCs (hCSCs) over long term culture. We will validate the homing capacity of hCSCs in the clinically-applicable MI injury model and track the hCSCs utilising dual-mode radionuclide-fluorescence reporter gene whole-body multi-modal imaging (e.g. by SPECT/PET-CT-fluorescence imaging) in vivo. We will employ Laser Capture Microdissection to extract the transplanted hCSCs from the heart tissue and measure the expression of regenerative growth factors expressed by the hCSCs once they have homed to the damaged heart. This project will advance the development of an allogeneic, homogeneous cell product which is affordable, readily and widely available and compatible with the current clinical standard of care.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Impact by training:
As with any reputable scientific centre we are concerned that young scientists who come for training should be given as wide a scope as possible in order to keep their future scientific options open. This project will allow the development of the post-docs to develop a range of unique and specialist skills such as: 
(i) Learning new techniques; and
(ii) Gaining communication skills by presenting their work at weekly lab meetings and to the scientific and medical communities as well as to a more general audience.
(iii) Networking and collaborating with groups in microscopy and cell tracking/imaging. 

2. Impact on basic research and academia:
The present research project will move the use of allogeneic cardiac stem cells into the clinical arena. The findings of the present proposal will be of great interest for: 
(i) Stem cell and Regenerative Medicine investigators who are working to find ways to regenerate and repair organs and tissues. 
(ii) Cell/ molecular biologists who are interested in cell biology and physiology.
(iii) Histopathologists and microscopy biologists who are interested in isolating single cells from tissue using laser capture microdissection. 
(iv) Immunologists who are interested in allogeneic cell transplantation.
(v) Physicists and those that track cells in vivo. 
(vi) Physiologists who investigate cardiac muscle structure and function in health and disease; and 
(vii) Clinician/Scientists who would like to increase their understanding of mechanisms of cell therapy and regeneration. 

3. Impact on the clinic:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the Western World's biggest killer. We aim to develop a product which is a uniform therapeutic product which can be used for thousands of patients, will be available at all times, for all candidates, injected systemically, and at a reasonable price. No repair/regenerative therapy with these characteristics are presently available. Therefore, our research project has the potential to contribute to the nation's health by:
(i) Alerting clinicians who would like to collaborate on the clinical trial and use allogeneic cardiac stem cells in practice. 
(ii) Generating attention from affected patients, family members, general practitioners, immunologists.
(iii) Treating heart failure patients and improving their quality of life and expectancy.
(iv) Reduce expenditure growth of secondary care in the NHS budget. 

4. Impact on pharmaceutical industry:
Findings from the research project will: 
(i) Provide a clear understanding of the 'paracine' effect and the growth factors secreted by the hCSCs in vivo. 
(ii) Give opportunities for industrial applications; in other words, help to increase the speed of developing therapeutic interventions for targeting the activation of endogenous cardiac stem cells in situ. 

5. Impact on society via engagement of the public in science:
The results of the project will be released in a press release when the manuscript is published. The publication will be open access and available to the public. We will also disseminate results on websites, Facebook and Twitter. The PI of this application is a member of various scientific societies and takes active roles in trying to engage interested members of the public, particularly younger people, in science. The PI is a STEM ambassador responsible for engaging schools and colleges in science and engineering. I give talks at various schools around London and the South East on Stem Cells and Regeneration. The Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences has an outstanding track record in linking its research to public engagement and activities for engaging young people.
 
6. Timeline:
We plan to attend scientific conferences and publish manuscripts as soon as data are available. The Gantt chart outlines the timeline for regulatory strategy, production of allogeneic CSCs under GMP etc. We envision to start the clinical trial in 2018/19.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195911</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P026508/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>DD81206B-5EB4-4BCC-AEF7-808A64606E0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.2  Cellular and gene therapies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>0CDFB83C-594C-4860-B0BE-C82CA4D45B6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.2  Cellular and gene therapies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
