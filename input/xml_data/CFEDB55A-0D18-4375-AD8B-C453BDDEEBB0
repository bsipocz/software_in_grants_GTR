&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What can we learn about the politics of austerity from previous periods of cutback. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How does international experience with cutbacks match UK experience.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How well can propositions about cutback management from earlier periods be applied to today's age of austerity. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The study aims to explore:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Whether the politics of austerity requires a reversal of normal routines in politics and government.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What shapes outcomes when spending is reduced.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What is common across different cases. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How governments shift or avoid blame from voters.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What are the effects of such cutbacks. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Those questions come at the intersection of writing about government growth, crisis management, blame-avoidance, and bureaucratic politics and budgeting behaviour. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will match analysis of historical cases of austerity politics in the UK with real-time observation of efforts to restrain expenditure in the 2010s. It will put UK experience into context by examining a set of international cases. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will be based on historical and contemporary documents, including archival materials, interviews with policy-makers and the expertise of relevant overseas scholars. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>360201</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Oxford Blavatnik School of Government conference on Shared Services</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9FF2AD6B-41A1-478E-B4AC-38B5DFD4D09E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My talk provoked questions and discussion

One is through Christopher Hood's membership of the UK Government Office of Science Analytic Review of HM Treasury in 2012/13, where the study's work on earlier fiscal squeezes helped Christopher Hood to frame advice on how the Department could use its straitened resources to maximum effect in the post-2010 environment.
A second is through dialogue with policymakers in the UK to put their current efforts in fiscal squeeze and spending restraint into comparative and historical perspective. One key impact took place through high-level discussion of our comparative findings at a 2015 'Forum' event at the British Academy, attended (among others) by top UK Treasury officials and the Chief Economist of the OECD. In 2014 the work was also directly drawn to the attention the Scottish Parliament finance committee and to practitioners attending the University of Edinburgh's annual 'New Public Sector' seminar by Professor David Heald, who collaborated in the project's comparative analysis. 
A third is through direct dialogue with policymakers overseas seeking comparative and historical perspective on fiscal squeeze and cost control. Christopher Hood has been invited to discuss the project's findings with overseas policymakers in Norway, Portugal, People's Republic of China (visit scheduled for 27 February 2016) and Iceland (visit scheduled for November 2016). In addition, the book on 30 years of UK running cost control (arising out of the ESRC project combined with work done for a Leverhulme project) won NAPA's 2015 Louis Brownlow prize for best book in Public Administration - the first time a British book has ever won this important prize, enabling Christopher Hood to present and discussing the research findings with a large group of practitioners and academics at NAPA's annual meeting in Washington in 2015. 
A fourth is through impact on the training of practitioners, through the Small Countries Financial Management Programme (which is part-sponsored by the Isle of Man government and supported by the World Bank), where the study's emerging insights into options for fiscal squeeze have been used since 2011 by Christopher Hood along with Scott Douglas from the University of Utrecht to train civil servants from small countries around the world in identifying options for fiscal squeeze and their consequences. 
Finally, the study has fed into and supported the work of the UK Treasury in moving to commission (along with the Nuffield Foundation and the ESRC) a new history of UK public expenditure control from 1993 to 2015, and on the basis of the work done for this project Christopher Hood was asked to provide input and advice into the development of the research specification for that project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>91E497BA-B775-4D3C-BFC6-6D571DB6AEC2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5551c3b2b70237.56763740</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>- Is Fiscal squeeze (defined as episodes when public spending fell and/or revenue rose) a Blame Magnet? Comparing nine cases of fiscal squeeze by different democracies, and 19 fiscal squeezes over time in the UK, led to two findings about the relationship between fiscal squeeze and blame. One is that fiscal squeeze in democracies is often, but not always, a 'political blame magnet.' Squeezes did not always presage electoral defeat for incumbent parties and some incumbents gained political credit. The other is that delegation of unpopular spending-cut decisions to outside bodies is surprisingly rare. 

- Fiscal Squeeze over Time: From Surgery Without Anaesthetics to Boiling Frogs? Comparing 19 fiscal squeezes in the UK from 1915 to 2015 showed that in the later part of that century, revenue-only squeezes, once common, disappeared. Moreover, there was a change in the length and depth of spending squeezes over the century. Some of the earlier squeezes resembled the days of surgery before anaesthetics, with deep spending cuts made speedily, but later on (including the most recent 2010-2015 episode) the process was more like the well-known myth that a frog can be boiled alive by very slowly heating the water in which it is placed. Recent squeezes relied heavily on slowing the growth of public spending while the economy grew rather than absolute spending cuts or sharp revenue rises. That finding raises intriguing questions about what explains this changing pattern of fiscal squeeze and whether it is here to stay

- What's the Rarest Type of Fiscal Squeeze? Both the cross-national comparison and the over-time comparison of UK fiscal squeezes show that what we term 'double hard squeezes' (that is, cases combining appreciable increases in tax revenue in real terms and as a proportion of GDP with appreciable decreases in government spending in real terms and as a proportion of GDP) are extremely rare in democracies. The UK had only one such squeeze over a century (after World War I) and there was also only such case in our cross-national comparison of fiscal squeezes.

- How Many Different Types of Austerity Are There? Fiscal squeeze is often discussed in an undifferentiated and politicized language of 'austerity' and conventionally measured by reported financial outcomes, particularly in relation to deficit or debt reduction. But our analysis shows up many different ways of squeezing that are concealed by that catch-all approach. We distinguish at least sixteen types of fiscal squeeze by differentiating the revenue and spending aspects of squeezing, and exploring changes both relative to GDP and in constant-price terms. And by using a mixed method approach that combines financial outcome data on what happened to spending and revenue with more qualitative data (relating to the degree of pain inflicted by voters, the degree of political risk taken by incumbent parties and the effort exerted by the state machinery), we show that conventional outcome numbers only partly reflect the timing of fiscal squeezes and the effort going into them.

- What Happens to Government operating costs in Fiscal Squeeze? Analysing what happened to running costs in UK government over thirty years comprising two key fiscal squeeze episodes (the 1980s and 1990s) showed that government running costs rose substantially in constant-price terms over the period as a whole despite deep cuts in civil service staffing, and adoption of different methods of cost control. There were short-lived reductions in costs in the 1990s episode, but not in the 1980s one.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project has developed our knowledge of fiscal squeeze both by developing a new typology with new metrics of squeeze that enable us to compare across space and time, and by compiling systematic data on fiscal squeezes cross nationally and across time over a century in the UK. That contribution both enables us to answer some important questions about commonalities and differences among fiscal squeezes, and to reveal new questions that merit further investigation by the methods we have developed, building on the systematic comparative and historical datasets we have developed. For the UK, the database brings together into a readily accessible form socio-economic, fiscal and political variables for the period 1900-2010, including data on incumbents, their political orientation, margin of victory, average expenditure and revenue under each governments, and various direct and indirect tax rates. 

More specifically, here are five kinds of questions and inquiry that arise out of the approach and data we have developed in the course of this project. Some of them are 'curiosity' questions, others more directly related to matters of policy, and we intend to pursue most of them on our own or in collaboration with others. 

1. What exactly explains two long-term observed changes in fiscal squeezes over a century in the UK - namely the shift from short and sharp spending squeeze episodes to longer-drawn-out episodes, and the relative disappearance of revenue-only squeezes in more recent decades? 

2. What exactly is different about electoral and other reactions to the announcement as against the implementation of expenditure cuts and revenue rises? Most of the econometric literature focuses on implementation effects, but the mixed-method approach we have developed for identifying the extent and timing of squeezes makes possible a more systematic distinction between announcement effects and implementation effects of fiscal squeeze. 

3. Given widely differing claims about the distributional effects of public spending reductions and tax increases (particularly in the light of cuts in welfare spending and tax rises in the Eurozone in the recent crisis) and the importance of distributional analysis in the next phase of the UK's fiscal squeeze, what can we learn from linking the social indicators available through projects such as EUROMOD (https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/euromod) to our typology and comparative analysis of fiscal squeezes? What could we learn from such an exercise about associations with indicators for inequality, child poverty, median incomes and various types of unemployment with respect to different types of fiscal squeeze? 

4. Given that what we term 'double hard squeezes' - that is, fiscal episodes where revenue rises substantially both in constant prices and as a proportion of GDP while at the same time government spending falls substantially both in constant prices and as a proportion of GDP - appear to be extremely rare in democracies from both our comparative and over-time analysis, what can be learned by a comparison focused on those rare and extreme cases?

5. Given that our research reveals that UK government running costs rose in constant price terms over some notable periods of fiscal squeeze (particularly in the 1980s, contrary to stereotype and in spite of major cuts in staffing), how typical or exceptional are UK running cost outcomes?</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1D1FC2C1-611F-417F-AF65-CB24BE147B6F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4439604677.669336b2f2b4be</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://xgov.politics.ox.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of GO Analytical Review of HM Treasury</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28A654FE-9C9B-4B3A-8D4D-CA9D377FC579</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I participated as an independent member of a key review of the analytical capacity of HM Treasury and made recommendations, partly based on my ESRC research, designed to improve its efficacy in scrutiny of public spending.
