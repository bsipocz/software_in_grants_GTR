&lt;p>Using life history interviews with a sample of desisting (3-5 years post conviction) and persisting offenders (recently re-convicted) it explores how and why some individuals convicted of serious sexual crimes are able to move on from such pasts and successfully desist from future re-offending.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The interpretive analysis of participants? subjective life experiences will enable an understanding of how desisting individuals are able to ?make sense? of their past lives and the serious harms they have caused, how individuals can overcome the personality traits and predispositions that may have contributed to their offending, and how they have been able to transcend the shame and stigma related to this type of offending. In other words, the themes and dynamics of desistance identified in this research are likely to be distinct from the risk factors that are well known in the research literature.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This contribution would have obvious and direct benefits for the development of theory and therapeutic work aimed at supporting desistance among those convicted of previous sexual offences.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of this programme will be public sector bodies charged with the treatment and management of sexual offenders, particularly probation and prison services, and the police. The potential impact will be improved treatment, management and assessment of sexual offenders. This would in turn lead to increased effectiveness of the public bodies named, and consequently improvements in quality of life and public safety in general. An additional beneficiary will be people who have committed sexual offences. They would benefit from improved treatment programmes and assessment methods that were more accurate and took better account of protective or desistance related factors.

1) In 2010/11 the UK National Offender Management Service (NOMS) redesigned its sex offender programmes for use in prisons and probation. The model of change for these programmes developed from a purely psychological one to a 'biopsychosocial' approach. The 'social' aspects of the new programmes were intended to take account of the literature on desistance from offending, which seemed to indicate that offenders desist from further offending for a number of social reasons as well as psychological ones. Such reasons seemed to include social networks, employment, and relationships with others. Yet for the most part the design teams relied upon research into desistance from general, antisocial crime rather than specifically from sexual crime. It is intended therefore that one beneficiary of the research will be NOMS, which will be able to base its sex offender interventions on practical, specific research into desistance from sexual crime rather than extrapolating from other research.

2) At present the assessment of sexual offenders relies almost exclusively on examining 'risk factors'. These are factors that have been shown by prior research to be common to individuals who re-offend. This approach raises issues of fairness in that it ignores work that offenders may have carried out themselves to reduce the likelihood of reoffending, and it can be seen as burdensome by offenders. It also fails to give a balanced assessment of offenders because it ignores the fact that offenders may desist from future offending for reasons other than having the presence or absence of such risk factors. NOMS has been working on a new assessment tool for sex offenders called the Active Risk Management System, which sets out to address some of these shortcomings by enabling an assessment of desistance factors as well as risk factors. As with the development of treatment programmes, however, because of the dearth of research into desistance from sexual offending this work has tended to rely on research on desistance from general, non-sexual offending. Again the ability to access sex offender specific research into desistance would provide a more defensible basis on which to develop such tools.

3) Research into desistance from crime so far has tended to indicate that a combination of informal social controls (such as work, relationships etc.), combined with cognitive transformations, or changes in the way offenders think about themselves and their lives, are important in promoting desistance. This provides non-specialist correctional staff such as probation or police 'offender managers', with concrete, non-technical means of addressing offending behaviour that do not require specialist skills or training in the way that many offender treatment programmes based on risk/need/responsivity principles do. Thus probation and police services will benefit more generally by an increased knowledge about management and treatment of this risky group of individuals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>182509</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>National Offender Management Service</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration/Partnership with National Offender Management Service, Interventions Services</gtr:description><gtr:id>38C457FD-6685-4409-A40A-5510FDD08510</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Fieldwork has been completed and data analysis is well advanced and is ongoing.

These key individuals all gave invited presentations. Following this successful symposium, as the first dedicated meeting of scholars on sex offender desistance world-wide, a research network of academics and practitioners has been established and a special journal issue is to follow from the conference.
Since this research looks at why sex offenders do not re-offend rather than why they do, it also has the potential to increase societal and professional knowledge of this offending group and to change policy approaches to sex offending in the longer term.

The conference has lead to further collaborative activity in the form of the establishment of a research network of academics and practitioners in relation to sex offender desistance and a planned journal special issue incorporating papers from the conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d4233056bd19.56500392</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Desistance and Rehabilitation Cultures&quot; HMP Kirkham, Lecture, Invited Speaker, Prof Shadd Maruna (Co-I)  2 Feb 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B87F8560-A607-4CC3-BFF0-F0840FF66D33</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited seminar to practitoners and prisons staff which provoked lively discussion and requests for further information</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1f9d9044650.52100845</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>School of Law</gtr:department><gtr:description>School Conference Funding Application - to fund an International Symposium on Sex Offender Desistance (see under Engagement Activities)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Queen's University Belfast</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>4970CE6A-443B-4269-BDC6-F8C3E6D4B4B8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e34084ad094.76174103</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings are beginning to feed into the training of those who deliver sex offender assessment and treatment programmes as well as the treatment manuals and provision delivered by the National Offenders Management Service (NOMS).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DD7918CC-1FFF-451E-9610-B9BBFCA09C59</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544e40d4484aa3.94202333</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main findings from the research are that a number of factors appear to underpin desistance from sexual offending: These include:

I) the importance of work and relationships as a means by which positive pro-social identities are constructed within and throughout the life histories of men thought to be desisting (though this does not apply in the same way as for non-sexual offenders in terms of being a defined 'turning point' in their lives: rather being able to point to significant work and relationship histories enables the desisting sexual offender to construct their personal identity as a non-offender, and point to their offending as an 'aberration' in an otherwise good life);

II) that the early stages of desistance are characterised by, inter alia, a re-appraisal of the pros and cons of re-offending; a positive view of rehabilitative programmes; and the role of 'hope' and a future-focused approach underpinning a non-offending identity. The rejection of the label 'sex offender' was an important prompt in initiating desistance, although the effects of long term, persistent labelling of the individual as a 'sex offender' resulted in social isolation for some.

III) the framing of previous offending as being situational acts as a form of 'shame management'. It enables ex-offenders to explain their offences in a way which, from their perspective, makes them more understandable and less indicative of a 'deviant' personality. Thus, it contributes towards the development of a pro-social personal identity.

IV) the role of neutralisation, shame and guilt within 'shame management' and non-offending identities. Desisting participants made considerable use of denial and minimisation in their explanations. This was interpreted as a form of shame management that enabled them to come to terms with their offending and move on in a positive way without being disabled by guilt and shame.

While previous studies drew out similar factors for desistance from offending in general, until very recently there was no or at least very limited empirical research in the specific area of desistance from sexual offending. This study also contributes to societal and professional knowledge about sex offending by focusing on why sex offenders do not re-offend rather than focusing on 'risk-based' factors which asks why is it that they do. Future publications also hope to explore these broader implications for risk discourses as a whole. In addition, the implications for practitioners from these findings have been developed and shared with professionals in various forums.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings may be used by scholars in the areas of sex offender risk assessment and management specifically in terms of the variables that are known to underpin desistance from sexual offending.

It is also hoped that building on early engagement with the research by professionals and policy makers that it will continue to impact and potentially change the formulation and delivery of current treatment and management interventions for sex offenders within the UK.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>88AEB514-4D2D-4EB6-AB1F-CA5F92ED64AC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e3ef7e2a513.98139382</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influences on training of practitoners, treatment frameworks and provision for sex offenders by NOMS</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FBD06485-C9FC-411B-B598-84648AD58286</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Some of the key findings from the study (e.g. the role of hope and the importance of a future-focus) are beginning to feed into training of treatment professionals and the manuals underpinning sex offender treatment programmes delivered by NOMS (National Offender Management Service).

One Co I (Farmer) is employed as the National Specialist Lead for community sex offender programmes within NOMS. Farmer is using results from the research to inform several areas of practice. For example

1) The results are being fed into national training programmes and events for probation officers.
2) Some of the findings have been used to inform the development of a new, national accredited programme for sexual offenders.
3) Findings have been used to influence risk assessment tools for sexual offenders.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d42e822d9c54.03088858</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influences on Postgraduate Research Provision</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CCC93AFC-95A7-4CAC-9BB3-D2FCF485EED0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The initial results of the research are beginning to be fed into taught postgraduate research provision - they are being used to inform teaching on a PG research led Masters level module on 'Sex Offending, Risk and Society' led and taught by the PI, as well as Master's and PhD dissertations in the area of sex offending against children.

In addition, one of the co-Is, Mark Farmer, is pursuing a PhD in this area of Sex Offender Desistance which will draw directly on the results of this research and which, via subsequent publication and conference presentation, will potentially make a substantial contribution to the literature.

However, at this stage, just over 15 months in to a 40 month project, it is too early to quantify this potential impact</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544e3a2bb535f5.34519711</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We now have a database of 32 audio recorded interviews with sex offenders which details their life histories - from childhood, early adulthood, through their offending period and aftermath, to the release and reintegration.
