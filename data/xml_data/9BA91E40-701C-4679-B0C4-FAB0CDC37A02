&lt;br />
&lt;br />Previous studies that have gathered perceptual data from non-linguists have encountered problems in data processing.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, a major aim of the project is to address these problems by establishing firm links with relevant researchers working in other fields in order to perform a survey of resources that may be available (or could be adapted or created) in order to process perceptual data gathered from non-linguists.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A small amount of pilot study research will be undertaken in order to investigate perception along the border, and provide information for use in the development of effective data processing tools.

In September 2013, I was the lead academic consultant for an ITV 'Tonight' documentary about Language Attitudes ('Accents Speak Louder than Words'), and I featured extensively in the broadcast itself. The programme dealt with the findings of a piece of polling on attitudes to language performed by ComRes, which I was able to help interpret by drawing on my own research findings. The 'Tonight' programme is the most frequently watched documentary strand on ITV and usually broadcasts to around 2 million viewers.

My research has also informed my contributions to radio broadcasts:

I added to the body of scholarship in the field through my findings of a differential effect of the Scottish-English border. This meant that for English respondents the border acts as a barrier to information flows from Scotland. This is not the case for Scottish respondents, for whom the border is less important for their perception of the dialect landscape.

I was able to contribute to the development of the field of perceptual dialectology by producing two new data processing/gathering techniques. These techniques involved using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology used in geographical sciences to deal with data gathered during the course of my investigations into the perception of language variation. A further technique was developed using an online tool which can now be used to gather more information regarding the perception of language.

I was also able to contribute to my professional development by participating in cross-departmental collaboration. This collaboration was primarily with the School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh and resulted in the development (in partnership with an MSc student in the School of GeoSciences) of the tools mentioned above. Throughout the Fellowship I aimed to create strong links between the School of Linguistics and English Language and the School of GeoSciences, the culmination of which was a talk given to the Language in Context research group by Dr William Mackaness. My professional development was also continued by attending other professional development meetings relating to successful grant applications, developing partnerships with outside organisations, communicating with non-academic audiences as well as a workshop on using geographical census data.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings relating to the methods in perceptual dialectology, and particularly the application of GIS technology, have been put to use by other scholars in the field.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E3E3B3FC-659B-4A49-B7CF-98FB9AABE954</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5459f06d4c3bc5.93703130</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C5383FD2-0C26-44A1-A1CF-0A4ACF1C86FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Perceptual Dialectology and Geographical Information Systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Linguistic Geography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8644da9d67839023f3420d6784d532e5"><gtr:id>8644da9d67839023f3420d6784d532e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Montgomery, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5459f3248e13b8.65476297</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>88116C5E-758D-4047-B0AF-C0F56C7EDEEB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Language, Borders and Identities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8644da9d67839023f3420d6784d532e5"><gtr:id>8644da9d67839023f3420d6784d532e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Montgomery, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5459f6082939d3.64276650</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DFEB2B8B-4587-43A6-9859-53CA0FAF61CF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dialectological and Folk Dialectological Concepts of Space - Current Methods and Perspectives in Sociolinguistic Research on Dialect Change</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/738e0a0b0f2ac83c08733141c5c047b0"><gtr:id>738e0a0b0f2ac83c08733141c5c047b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Montgomery C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5459f67fbb9c92.98754166</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>01A46992-FD0A-45A8-A526-3EE1DFEA3C65</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cityscapes and Perceptual Dialectology - Global Perspectives on Non-Linguists' Knowledge of the Dialect Landscape</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/738e0a0b0f2ac83c08733141c5c047b0"><gtr:id>738e0a0b0f2ac83c08733141c5c047b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Montgomery C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5459f82ba0d613.62577974</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G005451/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>28710E94-8B47-404A-BD40-7BCB8C709774</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FFA3A6C9-532B-4B83-B6F7-AAF3E63D34F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Stats., Comp. &amp; Methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
