It is a considerable pest of ornamental, vegetable, grain legume, and cotton, causing damage directly through feeding and indirectly through the transmission of plant pathogenic viruses, primarily begomoviruses. B. tabaci possibly originated in India and as a result of widespread dispersal, particularly during the last 15 years, is now distributed nearly worldwide and has risen in status to one of the most globally damaging pests of open field and protected crops (Global Invasive Species Database, http:// www.issg.org/database). 
The whitefly's ability to disperse is exacerbated by its extensive movement through commerce of plant products around the globe. In a new territory, its small size and rapid reproductive potential result in explosive population growth. These attributes, among others, render this species a shared pest within agricultural communities, especially in tropical and subtropical regions; ultimately, whitefly infestations are responsible for extensive losses in cassava crops, one of the most widely grown staple food crops in sub-Saharan Africa, or in cotton crops in India and Pakistan, among others. Therefore, this pest is a major threat for food security at a global scale, being the poorest areas of the world the most susceptible to its devastating effects, such Cassava brown streak virus that is transmitted by whiteflies. 
Although integrated crop management has been used to control Bemisia populations with limited success, insecticides are still the main control system. In addition to the potential undesirable impact of insecticides on the environment, whitefly populations have developed a high degree of resistance to several classes of chemical insecticides, which may render this solution useless in the near future. Of note, an innovative alternative method to control this pest with durable efficiency and without environmental side effects could rely on the use of specific RNA silencing. 
We have shown that we can silence specific genes of a phylogenetically closely related insect to whitefly, the green peach aphid Myzus persicae, by plant-mediated RNA interference (RNAi), i.e. by feeding this aphid species on plants that express transiently or stably double-stranded (ds) RNA to aphid genes (grant BBS/E/J/000C0623). Two aphid genes (Rack1 and MpC002) were silenced. The silenced aphids for both genes produced less progeny compared to aphids fed on plants expressing dsGPF (control). Thus, we could generate aphid-resistant plants using plant-mediated RNAi. 
In this project we examined if plant-mediated RNAi can also be used to knock down gene expression in whiteflies for the development of whitefly-resistant plants, including cassava crops and other staple food crops grown in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. 

This project impacted society at several levels: (A) Interactions among science disciplines; (B) Training of young scientists; (C) Communication of science to international science communities; and (D) Engagement with the general public.

(A) Interactions among science disciplines

This research is interdisciplinary, as it unified the study of organisms spanning two Kingdoms (namely Animalia and Plantae) and therefore incorporated entomology and plant biology.


(B) Training of young scientists

The project developed the career of a postdoctoral researcher. 

We hosted a PhD student from the University of Malaga, Spain, who obtained a short-term EMBO fellowship to visit my laboratory for 3 months (Sept - Nov, 2012). The postdoctoral researcher co-supervised the PhD student. 

(C) Communication of science to international science communities

This project was co-funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations Program (Seattle, WA, USA) and was a collaboration with Institute of Mediterranean and Subtropical Horticulture, University of Malaga-CSIC, Spain.

S. Hogenhout visited with Biosciences Eastern and Central Africa, International Livestock Reseach Institute (BecA-ILRI), Nairobi, Kenya), Feb 2014 and Apr 2014, to discuss ideas for future collaboration.

S. Hogenhout attended a meeting and presented a poster at Grand Challenges Explorations Ag; Nutrition Convening, Bill and; Melinda Gates foundation, Seattle, Washington, USA, May 2013.

The post doc presented a talk (invited based on abstract submission) at the 1st International Whitefly Symposium, Kolymbari, Sicily, Italy, May 2013


(E) Engagement with the general public:

Presented talk for group of African journalists visiting the JIC, Apr. 2014

Plants may include cassava crops and other staple food crops grown in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. 

Mining of public databases for B. tabaci sequence information revealed that the majority of transcripts are only partially sequenced. Moreover, little information was available for transcriptomes of hemipteran plant pests that are related to whitefly. Hence, it was decided to obtain high quality strand-specific transcriptome data for B. tabaci males, females and larval stages and for some aphid and leafhopper species. These data were used for identification of full-length transcripts of genes used as plant-mediated RNAi targets and for annotation of genome sequence data that are currently being generated for many hemipteran species. Comparative sequence analyses should reveal which genes are conserved and unique among hemipteran insects, enabling the development of plant/bacterial-mediated RNAi control methods for B. tabaci or multiple hemipteran species. 

Mining of the B. tabaci transcript sequence information identified several genes for targeting by plant-mediated RNAi. These were amplified and cloned into plasmid vectors for dsRNA production and transient and stable transformation into Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. 

We found that gene knock down was observed in adult whiteflies exposed to dsRNA producing in N. benthamiana leaf disks for 6 days. We are currently analyzing whitefly population growth on transgenic plants expressing dsRNA to different whitefly genes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are using the whitefly transcriptome data for project BB/L002108/1.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>08DF5209-BEF3-442E-BEB9-BD343BF60760</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462141e9043a1.27621965</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D90E4D28-5414-4BC2-AC4C-E91A0A07E4CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>, an experimental host for tomato yellow leaf curl disease-associated begomoviruses by agroinoculation and whitefly transmission</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant Pathology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b2a8412199f080690c9d083b384fe386"><gtr:id>b2a8412199f080690c9d083b384fe386</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ca?izares M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d46bfc49eee2.04283395</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/J/000CA487</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
