Ozone</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ST/K001744/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Many research groups in the UK and beyond are interested in tropospheric ozone (i.e. ozone close to the earth's surface). Ozone concentrations are gradually increasing across the northern hemisphere, because of increased emissions of pollutant precursors from growing industrialisation. Some progress has been made in reducing the severity of summer oxzone 'episodes' through European-scale emission controls, but there are still serious problems for both plant and human health which are likley to get worse with time.
Predictions of the future ozone climate depend upon models of atmospheric transport and chemistry - these can be tested by ground-based measurements, but the vertical structure of ozone concentrations within 1 km of the surface is not well known from measurments. Such measurements are needed to evaluate current models, and to improve model capabilities. 
Reliable predictions are needed to assess the effects on vegetation, whether loss of biodiversity in natural systems, or loss of income to farmers because of crop damage. In turn, effects on vegetation lead to economic losses in terms of ecosystem services (what we get from the countryside....food, fuel, water, amenity etc.) and food security. Ozone also affects man-made structures, shortening the lifetime of many plastics, rubbers and paint coatings, and causing damage to art works and our material heritage - ozone can be a problem indoors as well as outdoors.
Ozone also directly affects human health, particularly for vulnerable sections of society with a history of breathing difficulties. Current studies have to rely on measurements made in cities or in the countryside, but rarely matching people's normal patterns of exposure. As for effects on vegetation, there are pressing needs for measurement technologies that are relevant to estimating effects. 
Atmospheric measurements range from high-technology laser-based instruments for exploring the vertical structure of ozone in the atmosphere to simple rugged portable instruments that can be deployed to look at spatial and temporal variation in a city, or where people live and work, or where different types of plant grow. Many of the required technologies exist, and can be modified from one use to another, but there has been no joined-up thinking to make sure such knowledge is available across the research communities, or that the requisite technical expertise is available.
At present, the various different communities, with their different expertise and needs, have no forum for sharing ideas and 'wish lists'. This proposed network will bring the disparate research communities together in two face-to-face meetings, the first to share information, ideas and 'wish-lists', and the second for groups to suggest ways of collaboration, new research avenues and acccess to delivering engineering solutions. In addition, a web site will be set up to allow registered participants to access contact details, with a blog to capture comments, new ideas and requests for specific information or collaborative opportunities.
A successful outcome will be realised by transfer of ideas and technologies, the development of new partnerships, and several applications for future research using the UK community expertise effectively across the whole range of interests in which ozone is a key factor.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>i. Who (outside the academic community e.g. public, schools, industry, government etc.) might benefit from this network? 
The proposed network has communication and engagement at its heart by design. While the immediate beneficiaries will be the participants in the networking activities (workshops, topical meetings and online interaction), including academic researchers, regulatory bodies, small businesses and charities, the outcomes of these activities will have a wider impact, for instance: 
- with ozone being of interest for a wide range of groups and stakeholders in society (farmers' interests in crop damage, horticulturists' interest in potential damage to fruit and vegetables, indoor and outdoor ozone concentrations affecting the health of the general population etc.), the proposed website, and social media such as Twitter, Facebook and other established communication pathways, will be essential in broadcasting the outcomes of the network's activities, while at the same time allowing interaction of interested citizens; 
- with the increasing availability of small, portable, low-cost monitoring devices, engaging with ongoing activities on citizens' observatories and school/student projects, the direct integration of a wider community will be explored, e.g. through the CEH Schools Liaison Programme.
Many designated partners in the proposed network have ample experience in using these routes for knowledge brokerage and knowledge exchange and are involved in teaching and other knowledge exchange activities. The output of this network will primarily be delivered through grant applications to address the research challenges identified and in scientific publications. However, we are aware of the need for and will communicate concise, specific and targeted information for different stakeholder groups, e.g. policy makers and regulatory bodies or the general public. For this purpose, we will produce fact sheets and policy briefs, which aim at communicating the scientific findings from the network's activities in language that is accessible to a layperson. In addition, we will prepare material for schools and teachers to discuss the challenges of tropospheric ozone and its effects. Key stakeholders are Defra, Environment Agencies (EA, SEPA, NIEA), National Farmers Union, Conservation groups (SNH, JNCC, Natural England), SNIFFER, environmental health practitioners, charities and environmental/health consultants.
The team at CEH coordinating the network, but equally many network partners, have long-standing relationships with the media and experience in effectively communicating through press releases and feature articles in mainstream print and other media
 
ii. How might they benefit from this? 
We will be working in close collaboration with the NERC and STFC business development and knowledge exchange experts to identify those outputs of the network that would benefit from and have a value for exploitation. It is anticipated that the core value, with regard to the topic, will be in the non-commercial realm. However, potential savings (for instance in the field of statutory monitoring or by establishing concepts to reduce ozone impacts on agricultural/horticultural crops and human health) may be identifiable and will, where possible, be quantified. In the domain of human health, improved understanding of the mechanisms how ozone affects health will empower the general public as well as health practictioners to better respond to high ambient ozone levels.
The existing Knowledge Exchange fellowships (in particular those related to Environmental management for food and agriculture), as well as the Knowledge Transfer Networks (KTNs) will provide excellent outreach opportunities to engage with the commercial sector and other relevant stakeholders. We have contacted relevant KE Fellows and the Environmental Sustainability KTN (Anne Miller) and will engage with them e.g. on workshop organisation and dissemination activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121994</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Scotland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Historic Scotland</gtr:department><gtr:description>STFC Global Challenge Network on Tropospheric Ozone</gtr:description><gtr:id>F6C3FEFC-6655-46A5-B73A-C83D9F123D26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project website is online at http://www.ozone-net.org.uk/, further outputs are in preparation, e.g. policy briefs, scientific papers and reports.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>53302ebeca7849.88439703-9</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The network partners are providing input into workshops and lead on specific activities identified in the 2nd (consolidating) workshop.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Global Challenge Network on Tropospheric Ozone is an activity funded by the Science &amp;amp; Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and coordinated by the NERC Centre for Ecology &amp;amp; Hydrology (CEH).

All workshop documents can be found on the website provided below.

Communicating the workshop outputs led to several engagements with policy makers, e.g. presenting the network's aims and objectives to a high level group at the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and a further expansion of the network with groups and individuals not previously represented.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>53303014b3f532.98517748</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Workshop Facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ozone-net.org.uk/workshops</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar and future research collaboration discussion David Carruthers from CERC (CEH Edinburgh) - 18/09/2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB06B2DF-9FB6-4ECA-9A41-CEA98CD4B90E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>David Carruthers gave a seminar talk on &amp;quot;Multi-scale modelling of urban air quality using an advanced street canyon module in ADMS-Urban nested within a regional system: recent developments and validation in London and Hong Kong&amp;quot; and specifically the talk and subsequent discussion focused on local ozone hotspots and the need for adequately model air pollution across all spatial scales. The audience consisted of scientists and postgraduate students from CEH, Edinburgh University, Glasgow Strathclyde University, the Institute of Occupational Medicine, and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA).

The lively discussion following the talk focused on specific issues of atmospheric modelling across spatial scales, and the importance of urban and suburban ozone concentrations, which have been increasing with evidence in recent literature suggesting further increases in the future as urban nitrogen oxide emissions are declining. This led to the development of ideas for related research proposals, which have been agreed to be taken forward in 2015, specifically in a EU Horizon 2020 call on urban air quality, health and carbon management, led by CEH.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464b4c35635b0.08450582</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on Air Pollution and Health organised by Edinburgh University (Ruth Doherty, Chris Dibben) and CEH (Stefan Reis) - 7/8/2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>67FA0D2E-D00A-426F-BD23-C3DE1F5F3C31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A jointly organised workshop by Edinburgh University and CEH took place on 7th of August 2014, with &amp;gt; 25 participants (scientists, policy makers, health experts) from academia, research organisations, public health bodies (NHS Health Protection Scotland), regulatory agencies (SEPA), and other stakeholders (e.g. Transport Scotland) discussing general aspects of air pollution and health, including ground level ozone and other photochemical pollution in urban and rural areas. This workshop focused on exploration and information sharing, laying the foundations for a more structured collaboration on these topics between the different constituents.

This workshop has started and enhanced the dialogue between the different actors of air pollution health effects research in Scotland, with a series of follow-up meetings and invitations to workshops and conferences on the topic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464b6e083a2a5.33010440</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2nd (Consolidating) Workshop of the STFC Global Challenge Network on Tropospheric Ozone</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>194CFB51-3206-4626-952E-B148F9DD0ADD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The consolidating workshop held at Kings Manor at the University of York was attended by 22 participants, again from a variety of background and institutions. 
In breakout groups, specific work areas were identified, expanding on a proposal from the network coordinator and the topic champions, focusing on support along the following lines: 
? Travel grants to foster collaboration between network partners and the wider science community;
? Workshop/Event support e.g. for proposal writing and the exploration of specific, ozone related issues; 
? Publication support to support open-access publications on relevant ozone topics for dissemination purposes, as well as for the generation of policy briefs and other dissemination material.

A roadmap for grant applications on ozone modelling was agreed, aiming to prepare a NERC grant submission in early 2015.

This talk fostered collaboration and introduced groups to each other which had not previously collaborated. The highlight of spatial and temporal variability raised in the talk generated a range of ideas for cross-disciplinary research specifically on modelling climate impacts on regional and local ozone episodes, which will be further investigated in follow-up activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464b27ca08e74.57803314</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Quadrennial Ozone Symposium 2016, organised on behalf of the International Ozone Commission (IO3C) in Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F427E8C0-6EB3-4C11-9AA3-CF1DB8AAB111</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 2016 Quadrennial Ozone Symposium (QOS-2016) was held on 4-9 September 2016 in Edinburgh, UK. The Symposium was organized by the International Ozone Commission (IO3C), the NERC Centre for Ecology &amp;amp; Hydrology and the University of Edinburgh, and was co-sponsored by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, and the World Meteorological Organization. More than 300 participants from 39 different countries attended the Symposium. There were 6 keynote talks, 75 oral presentations and 270 poster presentations. QOS-2016 covered the breadth and depth of atmospheric ozone observations and research. Key topics included: stratospheric and tropospheric ozone observations and modelling; interactions between ozone, atmospheric chemistry and climate; ozone measurement techniques; and effects on human health, ecosystems, and agriculture. Engagement with stakeholders and policymakers was another key feature of QOS2016. The Symposium was opened by L. HEATHWAITE, Chief Scientific Advisor of Rural Affairs and Environment to the Scottish Government, and the Symposium's final day included two talks on the &amp;quot;Future challenges for stratospheric and tropospheric ozone&amp;quot;, followed by a moderated panel discussion on policy issues related to atmospheric ozone. The concluding discussions focused on communication of the research findings to policy decision-makers. R. HARRABIN, the British Broadcasting Corporation's Environment Analyst, moderated a panel discussion, addressing future research challenges for ozone, and highlighting the relevance of communication at the science-policy interface. The final words were reserved for I. BOYD, Chief Scientific Adviser at the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who reflected on the challenges of communicating complex scientific findings and uncertainties to policy decision-makers.
Before, during and after the Symposium, a number of side events took place. Under the auspices of WMO/GAW, NDACC and SHADOZ, an ozone sonde expert workshop addressed outstanding instrumental and operational issues, progress made in the ozone data quality assessment (O3S-DQA) with the homogenisation of long-term ozone sounding records and the preparation of design of JOSIE 2017/2018 experiments. A training school organised by the EU BrewNet COST Action ES1207 was primarily intended for Brewer Ozone Spectrophotometer operators and managers. It focused on set up and basic maintenance, data handling and submission, and diagnosing problems.
A Dobson Ad Hoc committee meeting considered what the future holds for the ground based network of Dobson ozone spectrophotometers a world with expanding instrumentation and needs, after 90 Years of monitoring the ozone layer.
Another side meeting followed on from the Symposium on September 9-10 and addressed the fundamental question whether the positive trend in ozone in the post-2000 period is statistically significant or not? Among topics for discussion were uncertainties of ozone trend estimates, statistical tools, comparison between observation and model trend estimates, and next steps for the upcoming WMO ozone assessment of 2018.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c503e7d37170.03255695</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ozone-symposium-2016.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Quadrennial Ozone Symposium 2016, held as one outcome of the network, has involved policy makers (e.g. the Chief Scientific Advisers to Defra and the Scottish Government) and supported further development of interest in ozone effects., leading to further funding.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>98F95FED-2668-4A42-A02D-73A656B53F72</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d966cb8a3644.40200425</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The network compiled - across scientific disciplines and policy topics - a comprehensive set of factsheets summarising the key issues of ground level ozone and its challenges for the development of coherent, effective policies to reduce impacts on human health, ecosystems and crops.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings presented in the factsheets will inform policy makers, regulators and other stakeholders and provide a better basis for the development of ozone control strategies.
