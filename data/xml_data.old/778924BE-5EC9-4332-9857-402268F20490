Whilst building on a longer history of the use of child migration in the UK, these schemes were notable both for their unprecedented scale of operation and their shared ambition to remove children from family and social environments in the UK deemed to be a source of moral risk. These schemes were intended not simply as practical welfare responses to the care of poor or displaced children, but as a moral project in which their migration was understood in terms of a move to a new redemptive environment that would enable them to flourish as pious and productive citizens, whilst strengthening the Anglo-Saxon racial stock of those colonies.

Whilst some children later regarded these schemes as useful interventions in their lives, others came to regard them as sources of unnecessary suffering. Child migrants to Canada were, in most cases, placed in remote rural homes where they served indentured placements as domestic workers rather than being adopted as full family members. This entailed both longer working hours and more limited access to formal schooling for them than would have been legal had they remained in Britain. In later schemes to Australia, children were mainly placed in residential institutions, some of which subsequently became the focus of allegations of systemic abuse and neglect. Whilst earlier migration schemes to Canada usually allowed some degree of on-going contact between child migrants and birth families, levels of parental consent and knowledge of the migration of their children in the later schemes to Australia were much lower. In many cases, birth parents were not told that their children were sent to Australia by institutions in which they had left them to be cared for, or were inaccurately told that their children would be adopted by families in Australia when they were in fact being sent to residential institutions. Child migrants to Australia have reported being told, inaccurately, that their parents were dead, or struggled to re-establish contact with their birth parents because their names or birthdays had been changed by receiving institutions. Through the work of organizations such as the Child Migrants Trust it has been possible for several hundred former migrants to be re-united with family members in the UK, although in many cases migrants have discovered that their birth parents had died before they were able to renew contact with them. The suffering associated with these schemes, particularly in the Australian context, has led to public apologies for them being made by the Prime Ministers of both Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as a number of other organizations in Australia including the Anglican and Catholic Churches, the Irish Christian Brothers, the Salvation Army and Barnardo's. 

This project will support the development of the first major exhibition on these child migration schemes to be held in the UK, at the V&amp;amp;A Museum of Childhood, which is expected to attract around 250,000 visitors, with media coverage of the exhibition reaching a much larger audience than this. The PI will also work with organizations directly involved in running these schemes to explore public statements or other activities they may wish to undertake in conjunction with the exhibition. Media outputs arising from this project will also explore the current experiences of former child migrants, including on-going forms of support that may be needed. An on-line film and lesson plan on these child migration schemes will also be produced in conjunction with the award-winning educational provider TrueTube for use with secondary school students at Key Stages 3 and 4.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit the following groups:

* Former child migrants and their families. From evaluations of 'On Their Own' in Australia, it is clear that former child migrants have strongly welcomed the exhibition as an opportunity to raise sympathetic public awareness of their experiences. This is particularly important given that many child migrants have experienced their involvement with these schemes, and their lack of ties to their birth families, as an enduring source of shame lasting into their adult lives. Some former child migrants have said that this exhibition has given them a framework within which they were able to talk for the first time about their experiences to their partners and children. It has also led, in some cases, to some former migrants taking steps to trace and establish relationships with family members in the UK or with others whom they knew as children. The extended version of 'On Their Own' to be delivered by this project will replicate all of these benefits, with the added value of helping former child migrants and their families to understand their experiences in greater historical context. The more open-ended elements of the project (in terms of liaising with organizations involved in the delivery of the schemes and reviewing on-going support needed by former child migrants) also has the potential for generating pastoral statements or apologies that former migrants might experience as a helpful public recognition of painful aspects of their experience and leading to additional Government or private funding for their support.

* Organizations involved in the delivery of these schemes. These schemes present a complex legacy for the organizations involved in their delivery, most of whom are still leading providers of welfare services to children. The intention of this project is to allow organizations an opportunity to reflect publicly on their work in ways that enable them to preserve a sense of the value of their on-going work whilst recognizing problems associated these earlier schemes in ways that former child migrants might find constructive. Discussions with these organizations will also provide an opportunity to establish whether a broader review of their continued services to former child migrants would be useful and whether there are any aspects of former migrants on-going needs that might benefit from some fresh intervention. Close working with the Child Migrants Trust will be an essential part of this process.

* Wider public audiences, including school students at Key Stages 3 and 4. The project will make possible the largest public engagement with the history and legacy of these child migration schemes since the broadcasting of Lost Children of the Empire and the Leaving of Liverpool over twenty years ago. Whilst there has been sporadic news coverage of these issues over that twenty year period (notably the public apologies by the Australian and British Prime Ministers in 2010) and some important media work (e.g. Jim Loach's 2011 film, 'Oranges and Sunshine'), it can be expected that this exhibition and related media outputs could reach a public audience of at least 750,000-1,000,000 people. For people with some previous knowledge of these schemes, the project is likely to increase their understanding of their moral rationale and historical context. For others, the project may be the first time they have learned about these schemes. This is particularly likely to be true for the target audience of the TrueTube film, given that no specialist media on the history and legacy of these schemes has previously been developed for a teenage audience. The project will therefore play an important role in introducing a new generation to this material.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79976</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This award has generated several key impacts:

* the co-curation of a major national exhibition on the UK child migration schemes ('On Their Own: Britain's Child Migrants') running from 24/10/15 to 12/6/16 at the V&amp;amp;A Museum of Childhood. The exhibition is expected to receive at least 350,000 visitors. The exhibition launch received full page coverage in all the major UK national broadsheet newspapers, as well as coverage on the Radio 2 Jeremy Vine Show, the Radio 4 PM Programme and BBC South-East News. Total media audience reach of this coverage was around 17 million people. This exhibition had previously been curated by the Australian National Maritime Museum and toured extensively across Australia. The larger size of the Museum of Childhood exhibition space required substantial re-working and re-interpretation of this prior content (with around 80% of the exhibits and label text newly created for the London version of the exhibition). The PI was appointed as academic curator for this process. The PI shaped the core interpretative approach of the exhibition, identified almost of all of the new content added to the exhibition, wrote the conceptual content of the exhibition design brief for the commissioning of the external designer, liaised with different stakeholder groups (including charities and advocacy groups for former child migrants) to ensure successful delivery of the exhibition and participated in the key media interviews for the exhibition launch. The exhibition has received strong praise, with the Arts Editor of The Times describing it as 'a major achievement' and the BBC's special correspondent on migration issues, Emma Jane Kirby, describing it as 'beautifully done and heart-wrenching'. Speaking at the exhibition launch, the Shadow Home Secretary, Andy Burnham MP, praised the exhibition and said that he wanted to declare his support for a full public inquiry into the UK child migration schemes. In February 2016, the Prime Minister, David Cameron commended the exhibition in a public message to the Child Migrants' Trust on the 6th anniversary of the national apology to former child migrants, saying that he was pleased that the exhibition was making this history known to a new generation of young audiences.

* As part of the exhibition, new folk songs were commissioned to articulate children's own experiences of the migration schemes (in contrast to hymns and institutional songs that children were taught by sending and receiving agencies). Musicians involved in this project include high profile British folk artists such as John McCusker, Boo Hewerdine, Belinda O'Holley and Heidi Tidow, Julie Matthews and Chris Whiles. These songs have been released as a separate album, 'The Ballads of Child Migration', which includes detailed sleeve notes on the history of the child migration schemes written by the PI. The album has been described in a review in The Guardian as a 'poignant and powerful history lesson' and was officially launched at a premiere performance as part of the Celtic Connections folk festival at the Glasgow Royal Concert Halls, including guest appearances by Eddi Reader and Barbara Dickson. The performance also received coverage on BBC Scotland television news and the BBC Radio Scotland arts programme, on which Julie Matthews talked about how inspiring the underpinning research for this project had been for the song-writing process. Songs from this album have been played on Radio 2 and Radio 6 Music, and will feature in a specially-commissioned drama involving musicians from this project and the former children's laureate, Michael Morpurgo. [February 2017 update: The dramatization of Michael Morpurgo's, All Alone on the Wide, Wide Sea, using songs from the Ballads project will be broadcast over four half hour episodes in May 2017 during the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2. A short set of songs from the Ballads project will also be performed live at the Royal Albert Hall, with simultaneous broadcast on BBC Radio 2, on 5th April 2017 during the 2017 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards ceremony.]

* Through this process, the PI has also been in active contact with staff on two national child abuse inquiries to provide them with historical and contextual information about the environments in which former child migrants experienced abuse.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D5C24928-BBEA-4819-A3AB-80DDDBA542D0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc95ea6cb322.22929766</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through undertaking archival research for this project, it has been possible to establish that:

* there were strong similarities between the American 'orphan train' schemes and the UK child migration schemes to Canada, and that in some important respects these had established standards of practice that were unhelpfully reversed in later UK child migration schemes to Australia (e.g. in terms of independent supervision of placements).

* that there were very clear grounds for concern about the child migration schemes from their onset, and particularly after 1945 when they operated increasingly against the grain of accepted standards of child-care practice in the UK. 

* that the moral framing of these schemes - as humanitarian interventions undertaken in the best interests of the child - contributed to relationships, assumptions and practices that proved harmful to children.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work done for this project has established a helpful overview of the American and British child migration schemes.
