A creative study of animal and human hibernation</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/D501849/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Hibernator is a body of work that attempts to unite the practice of artists, scientists, technologists and ecologists and make sure unusual connections between nature, popular culture and medical science. The human race has long been inspired by nature's processes, putting animals, plants and climatic change under the microscope to inform technological development. Learning to harness nature has helped man to survive on the planet for centuries.\n\nAt a time when the human habitat is increasingly changing and the future existence of animal and humankind is int he balance, it is perhaps an irony that there are current scientific researchers looking for methods of extending human life. When we fail as the custodians of this planet there is always the promise that through space exploration a future planet may be available for our habitation.\n\nWalt Disney presents us with a point of departure for this research. As founder of the animation and entertainment empire that still bears his name he is a figurehead embedded within popular culture and mythologised through the sensational claims made around his death that he was the first human to be cryogenically frozen. Cryonics is a speculative life support technology that seeks to preserve human life in a state that will be viable and treatable by future medicine; therefore the Disney myth suggests that the great animator is awaiting reanimation on the day when science can bring his frozen body back to life.\n\nThe Walt Disney myth exemplifies mankind's misplaced faith, the dreams, hopes and fears we project onto technology. Within the proposed programme of research, connections will be made between notions of multimedia (Disney was thw world's first multimedia corporation) and current scientific experiments aiming to induce hibernatory states in non-hiberbatory species including humans. Linking to the forest-animal iconography of Disney and state of the art animation techniques a work for a gallery context will be developed to incorporate an animatronic 'chimera' (or monstrous hybrid). An immersive installation based on hibernatory environments will also be constructed for the public to experience within the context of a world space conference; and a series of 21st century animal habitats will be constructed in the ancient forest of King's Wood in Kent.\n\nThe audience will have the opportunity to engage in the research in a number of ways via the diverse outputs. The unifying narrative will emerge via the production of a publication via a collaborative publishing effort.\n\nThe various outputs to be produced will reflect a change in the recieved notions of the defintions of life and death; an intellectual/philosophical shift elicited by technological advance, connecting myth and science, environmental cues and technological control, the virtual worlds we imagine and the real world we cannot escape. This research draws together relevant and parallel areas of research that are contributing to significant developments and debates in science, art, technology and ecology. It is hoped that the bringing together of these ideas will encourage us to consider how the more radical advancements in science and technology could impact on popular culture and human life. Linking these areas of interest will also provide further opportunities to disseminate the creative process involved in such interdisciplinary ideas to a wide audience.\n\nThe outcomes of this proposal should particulalry appeal to the art-going public; art, ecology and science communities; academics, curators, writers, students studying engineering, media, art, science, film and animation and those concerned with the growing ecology debate.\n\nThe international context for this research is work that is taking place at the art-science, art-ecology and art-engineering interfaces; there are a growing number of symposia,</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>230318</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D501849/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8BB67751-1AD5-4EE8-9104-089D5F236DDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Digital Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
