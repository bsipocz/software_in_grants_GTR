A representative and well-studied example is the bar-joint framework which is the mathematical abstraction of a structure made of stiff bars connected by rotational joints. Such a framework is called rigid if it cannot be deformed continuously into another non-congruent framework.

Rigidity theory has a rich history which can be traced back to the work of L. Euler and A. Cauchy on rigid and flexible polyhedra. Other early work includes J. C. Maxwell's analyses of stable and deformable structures. Building on an observation by Maxwell from 1864, G. Laman established simple necessary and sufficient counting conditions for a 2-dimensional generically placed bar-joint framework to be rigid in 1970, thereby launching the field of combinatorial rigidity. Although extensions of this result to higher dimensional bar-joint frameworks have not yet been found, there exist significant partial results for the special classes of body-bar, body-hinge, and molecular frameworks. 

Since Laman's landmark result from 1970, interest in combinatorial and geometric rigidity theory has increased rapidly, and the extensive growth in results and techniques have led to the recognition of the field as one of the main branches of discrete geometry. An important contributing factor in the spurred interest in rigidity theory is the rapidly growing number of practical applications in science, engineering, and design, where frameworks serve as suitable mathematical models for both man-made structures (e.g. mechanical linkages, robots, sensor networks, CAD software) and structures found in nature (e.g. proteins and crystals).

While much previous work in rigidity theory has focused on generic framework configurations and finite structures, frameworks with symmetries and infinite frameworks have seen an ever-increasing attention over the last few years. 

Recent work has used methods from representation theory to obtain new necessary conditions for symmetric frameworks to be minimally infinitesimally rigid. However, determining sufficient conditions for a framework which is generic modulo some given symmetry constraints to be infinitesimally rigid is more challenging and requires additional methods from combinatorics and matroid theory. Building on recent developments, this project aims to obtain new combinatorial characterisations for the infinitesimal rigidity of diverse symmetric geometric constraint systems ranging from bar-joint frameworks in the plane through body-hinge or molecular structures in higher dimensions to hybrid constraint systems appearing in CAD. This will lead to new types of rigidity matroids on group-labeled quotient graphs whose descriptions and analyses will require a variety of combinatorial and algebraic tools. Investigations of these questions in the novel context of a general normed linear space will also bring in methods from functional analysis. For Euclidean symmetric bar-joint frameworks, the work also aims to obtain new necessary and sufficient conditions for stronger notions of rigidity such as global or universal rigidity. 
 
Regarding practical applications of the results, the project aims to design new algorithms for the rigidity analysis of symmetric proteins, which can be implemented as add-ons into rigidity prediction software suites such as ProFlex or Kinari for more accurate predictions, as well as to develop new architectures and faster algorithms for the control of multi-robot formations.
 
Finally, the project seeks to combine symmetric rigidity methods and functional analysis perspectives in the analysis of the rigid unit mode (RUM) spectrum of crystallographic frameworks and the flexibility analysis of quasi-crystallographic frameworks.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The rigidity and flexibility of (symmetric) geometric constraint systems is a hybrid mathematical theory with a wide range of applications in science and technology. The project is therefore likely to deliver impact to diverse mathematical areas as well as to several applied areas outside pure mathematics, such as robotics, computer-aided design, biochemistry, and crystallography. Dissemination of the developing research at international workshops and invited seminars will influence research activities, and encourage and promote cross-disciplinary collaborations, both within the UK and internationally.

The main academic impact of the project will be within and between the mathematical areas of discrete geometry, combinatorics, and operator theory. In particular, the research will lead to new types of rigidity matroids, the fundamental objects of study in combinatorial rigidity. The descriptions and analyses of these structures will require a mixture of techniques from combinatorics, group theory, and algebra. Moreover, the novel topic of analysing the rigidity of structures in a general normed linear space will establish new connections between discrete geometry and functional analysis. Symmetry-based rigidity methods are also expected to have wider applications outside rigidity theory and to contribute to the understanding and solution of problems involving symmetric structures in combinatorics, graph theory, and discrete geometry. Finally, with the investigation of flexibility of (quasi-)crystallographic frameworks, the research will create completely new research directions within the broad topic of operator theory and applications. Operator methods provide essential methodology in numerous applied areas, ranging from classical analysis to control theory and mathematical physics, and are expected to create similar impact on the field of rigidity theory.

Due to the inter-disciplinary nature of the research, there are also a number of actual and potential non-academic beneficiaries for this research project. For example, the research will have a definite short-term impact on robotics, as it will create and analyse new efficient architectures for the decentralised control of multi-robot formations.
Moreover, the symmetry-based methodology will lead to new insights and new refined algorithms for the detection of symmetry-induced flexibility in various articulated structures, such as robotic linkages, biomolecules, and proteins. This has potential applications in medicine and drug design, since many molecular rings, proteins, and virus capsids are symmetric, and symmetry plays a central role in macromolecular stability, assembly, ligand recognition, and drug-docking. Other impact areas of the research include computer-aided design, where symmetry-based methods may be used to detect and analyse singularities in geometric constraint solving, and in the materials science methodology, where the mathematical analysis of the flexibility of (quasi-)crystallographic frameworks are anticipated to give new insights into the dynamics and behaviour of crystal structures.

An important impact of the project will be the training of a PDRA. Since the project involves a mixture of ideas from diverse mathematical disciplines, it will engender a breadth of knowledge and expertise on the part of the PDRA, thereby contributing to the skills base in mathematical research in the UK. The project will also impact the wider public, particularly young aspiring scientists, through various outreach activities such as model-making sessions for gifted secondary school students.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98616</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our main findings regarding the rigidity and flexibility of symmetric geometric constraint systems are the following:

1) We established combinatorial characterisations of forced-symmetric (and anti-symmetric) infinitesimally rigid frameworks in the plane with reflectional symmetry in the case of norms where the unit ball is a quadrilateral. We also obtained combinatorial characterisations of symmetric isostatic (i.e. minimally infinitesimally rigid) frameworks in these normed spaces. We currently investigate extensions of these results to other groups and norms.

2) We derived new symmetry-adapted counts for pictures (straight-line drawings) in Euclidean d-space to be minimally flat (i.e., non-liftable to (d+1)-dimensional polyhedral scenes). Moreover, we established a combinatorial characterisation of minimally flat pictures in the plane which are generic modulo three-fold rotational symmetry. Extensions to other groups are currently under investigation. 

3) We described new classes of over-braced but typically flexible body-hinge frameworks. These structures are based on polyhedra with rigid faces where an independent subset of faces has been replaced by a set of holes. Further investigations of symmetric `block-and-hole structures' are currently in progress.

3) We established necessary conditions for d-dimensional infinite periodic frameworks to be globally rigid subject to fixed lattice representations. For d=2 we proved that these conditions are also sufficient for generic global rigidity. An important challenging problem is to extend these results to periodic frameworks with (partially) flexible lattice representations. It seems even more challenging to extend these results to finite symmetric frameworks.

4) We introduced new distance-constrained structures, namely string-node nets and meshes, where a mesh is a string-node net for which the nodes are dense in the strings. We described various construction schemes for these structures, and defined and classified `regular' linear meshes. Moreover, contrasting flexing and rigidity properties were obtained for some fundamental meshes in the plane with respect to non-crossing motions in the space of smooth meshes. 

5) We analysed persistent multi-robot formations with leader-follower structure. In such formations, designated leader robots control the trajectory of the formation and the remaining robots autonomously sense and adjust their positions locally to follow specified robots in such a way that the entire formation retains its overall shape. Within this model we described a rigidity-based approach for creating formations where persistence is maintained even if specified robots experience sensor link failures. Moreover, we looked at the impact of special geometry (e.g. symmetry) on the persistence of formations.

Overall, we have made substantial progress in the general theory of symmetric geometric constraint systems and we have opened up a number of new research directions in this area. So far there have been 8 research publications which provide significant advancements in the problem areas described in the first three aims of the project and beyond. The topic of (quasi-)crystallographic frameworks and the RUM spectrum described in the fourth aim have so far been given less attention in favour of the new topics of symmetric block-and-hole structures and mesh-like bond-node frameworks. Research on all of these topics is ongoing and several preprints are currently in preparation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We expect that the interest in developing a non-Euclidean rigidity theory will continue to grow over the next few years. Our ongoing work on this topic may also have practical applications in the area of formation control of mobile autonomous agents. 

Our ongoing work on symmetric liftings may have practical applications in computer vision and artificial intelligence and may lead to refined algorithms in these areas. This work also provides a new perspective on other problems in discrete applied geometry, where the same lifting matroid appears (eg. in the rigidity analysis of point-line frameworks).

Our characterisation of globally rigid periodic frameworks has opened up a range of further questions regarding the global rigidity of symmetric and periodic structures. We expect our new proof techniques to be useful in tackling further problems in this area. 

We view our work on string-node nets and meshes as the beginnings of what we see as a novel and interesting topic of geometric rigidity theory. This research has potential applications in materials science. 

Finally, the creation of architectures for the distributed control of multi-robot formations is a fast growing research area, and we expect rigidity- and symmetry-based methods to become increasingly important in this
