The research will test the novel hypothesis that emotional reactions are central to these processes: more specifically, the feedback from body motor states to visual processes only influences the latter if they are accompanied by positive or negative emotional reactions.

 &lt;li>to use converging techniques which explicitly evoke body states associated with positive or negative emotions&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to examine whether recording of EMG can be used as a new measure of implicit non-conscious memory retrieval.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries
The work will have implications well beyond fellow academics studying visuomotor processes, emotion, or social cognition. The advances in theory and methodology will benefit researchers in many areas of psychology including non-academic settings such as industry and clinical practice. Our findings will be of interest to the general public but particularly to artists, performers, and others with an interest in how actions evoke attitudes. Finally, the postdoctoral researcher's career will benefit from the project.

Benefits from the research
Applications of our research to industry are clear: Development of the facial EMG technique as an implicit measure of emotion allows consumer scientists to record how people respond emotionally to products, and it can trace the time course of how people learn to recognise features of the product. We will collaborate with Unilever to apply the facial EMG technique in the commercial setting. Tipper has a longstanding record of collaboration with Unilever which is currently ongoing, and Unilever has expressed interest in this new collaboration. Ultimately this would lead to increased economic competitiveness for the UK commercial sector.

In the longer-term behavioural change techniques will be developed that can &amp;quot;nudge&amp;quot; behaviour towards more positive outcomes, such as healthier eating. Apps for the i-pad will be developed that manipulate visuomotor fluency that evokes positive affect when interacting with fruit/vegetables.

Applications to clinical practice relate to disorders such as depression, where our research may indicate how disordered emotional states might interfere with the ability to learn about others and to make accurate character attributions. Collaborative work is already ongoing with Prof. Rogers at Oxford University examining how depression affects the function of visuomotor processes in perception. This research also suggests an approach to investigating and addressing the social deficits in autism, and other disorders distinguished by difficulty in processing social information.
 
The work will also be of interest to the general public. Most of us form impressions of others based on brief interactions every day, yet we have little awareness of the sources of these assessments. Our research will investigate how feelings about people may be much more dependent on our motor systems than we generally realise. This point is of general interest, but may be of particular interest to artists, performers, or others whose jobs or interests particularly involve eliciting emotions and attitudes through actions. Our research has been presented at the international conference, &amp;quot;Watching Dance: Taking a Multidisciplinary Approach to Investigating Kinesthetic Empathy&amp;quot; (Manchester, UK, April 2010), and was well received by artists involved in dance and film.

The postdoctoral research assistant who participates in the planning and execution of this research will develop a wide skill set which will prepare the researcher for a career in academic research, industry, or another applied setting. 

Timescale for benefits
Collaboration with Prof. Rogers is ongoing; an impact on clinical practice might be expected following publication of results around the end of Year 2

Collaboration with Unilever would begin around the end of Year 1; economic impact might be expected following 4-5 years.

Research would be disseminated to the general public via research reports on the Bangor University web site and through press releases beginning at the end of Year 2. Tipper and Hayes would give public lectures at the University and to local community groups.

Wider impact on research and industry would be expected following publication of results in high impact journals.

At end of award, develop behaviour change techniques based on emotional reaction to visuomotor fluency.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>353346</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have started to develop simple computer games that might be able to change preference and subsequent choice behaviour.

For example, from their current emotional state, what might their next actions be and from a series of brief encounters, how trustworthy are they? One mechanism that mediates these learning processes is simulation of action. 

Our central hypothesis is that although such simulation of other people's behaviour is necessary (Strachan et al, in press) it is not sufficient for social learning. Rather, an emotional response is also required. For example, in some of our studies some individuals always look towards targets the participant has to identify (valid faces), while others act more deceptively by looking away from targets (invalid faces). Virtually all participants orient their own attention to the location attended by another person: this is fast, automatic and cannot be overridden. In contrast, although at the group level we find learning of trust, not all individuals show such learning. 

We examine whether it is emotional reactions that mediate these individual differences? For example, clinical populations, such as depression, have suppressed emotional reactions. Even though these individuals have normal simulations of another person's eye-gaze, they failed to learn about how trustworthy the person is (Bayliss et al, 2016). Using converging approaches, Manssuer et al (2016) recorded the reactivity of facial muscles via electromyography (EMG) as a means of detecting implicit emotional reactions. They demonstrated that EMG data measuring emotional reactions during gaze cueing tasks did indeed identify whether people learned about another person's trustworthiness. Furthermore, the critical importance of using converging methods to develop models of cognitive and social processes was confirmed and extended to spatial compatibility tasks by Kirkham &amp;amp; Tipper (2015). 

A further aspect of our research programme was to examine whether techniques such as recording EMG and EEG can be used as measures of implicit non-conscious learning and memory. In terms of learning, as noted above, we knew from prior work that exposure to faces making helpful (looking at targets) or unhelpful (looking away from targets) changed how trustworthy these faces were. However, we did not know at what point learning was achieved, as trust ratings were only measured after final exposures were complete. We have now identified for the first time when such learning takes place by observing when helpful and unhelpful gazing faces are discriminated by emotion signals such as the late positive potential and EMG prior to gaze cueing (Manssuer et al, 2015, 2016).

In terms of studies of memory, we demonstrate that indeed EMG can be used as a measure of retrieval, and that boundary conditions provide important information. For example, Pawling et al (under review) demonstrate that prior body states are reinstated when re-encountering a stimulus, reflecting an implicit measure of retrieval. And in line with the above research, individual differences can be detected in these embodied encoding and retrieval processes. In contrast, Kirkham et al ((2015) demonstrate that when body states are activated when observing someone's else's behaviour, these can be so automatic that prior learning cannot override them.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Summary of impacts to date 

The research programme was basic science aiming to identify the core processes involved in social learning. We have produced new evidence for the role of emotion as a critical variable during implicit learning of subtle social cues. We expect this work to have impact in the academic community over the coming years, reflected in citations of the outputs.

Furthermore, during the funding period the laboratory has been involved in a number of public understanding events, such as: York Festival of ideas, Science is Vital, Yornight researcher's caf&amp;eacute; etc.; as well as school events and media coverage (e.g., Western Mail). 

Also during the grant period initial studies were undertaken with industry (Unilever) to establish EMG as a method for using implicit on-line techniques to record emotional reactions to consumer product experience. This latter collaboration was productive and has provided the seed for future links between our basic science and British industry and a new collaborative project will be started in the next couple of months.

As noted above, one of our studies was the first investigation of implicit social learning in a clinical population. The data from depression supported our hypothesis that impaired emotional systems would block social learning. This has potential clinical relevance, because an inability to detect, learn and respond appropriately to social information such as who to trust, could feedback negatively, exacerbating depression. 

A further development during the funding period was to start to consider how our understanding of visuomotor fluency could be harnessed to change behaviour to improve health and wellbeing. Our techniques have been shown to change the assessment of stimuli, such that people can be trusted more, or objects preferred and selected more often. We have undertaken a pilot study where some of our techniques were built in to a simple computer game that children played. This study provided the existence proof that playing such a game for a short period of 2 minutes was indeed capable of altering preference and choice.

Anticipate/potential future impacts:

Potential impacts might emerge from the above initial activities. For example, there is extensive research examining how various populations, such as William's syndrome, autism, and schizophrenia, respond to direct social cues such as emotion and gaze shift. However, we know nothing, aside from our own study of depression, about how incidental learning takes place in these populations. This is an intriguing issue that has clear implications for understanding clinical populations, and we hope to pursue this in the future.

The second area where we see potential impact concerns the development of computer games. We have recently succeeded in gaining 4 years of research support from the Leverhulme Trust to continue our research programme. The aim of this work will be to discover new techniques that influence preference and choice. And the ultimate aim of this work is to build such implicit techniques in to fun games that children will play to improve health and wellbeing. That is, one target is to develop games that encourage healthy eating where preference for fruit and vegetables in increased. At the end of this 4-year Leverhulme grant we hope to have made significant progress towards this goal.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2F1A75EC-2C30-4567-A88C-14ACC69A412B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447dbe62e5245.46561625</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3BB1DB43-39FE-422C-8C66-105EE2C34F8E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Memory for incidentally perceived social cues: Effects on person judgment.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8b6b79e67ad09f489d45fca055c01067"><gtr:id>8b6b79e67ad09f489d45fca055c01067</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pawling R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0007-1269</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>57f3bc19462057.69332394</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8CDC21DE-0531-4C3A-9DB4-26AD83623702</gtr:id><gtr:title>Young children perceive less humanness in outgroup faces.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Developmental science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/39ca9237848e6ae806b96ebbafe549dc"><gtr:id>39ca9237848e6ae806b96ebbafe549dc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McLoughlin N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1363-755X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcb06939bb6.07633465</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B185DC24-40E6-4B6B-9B78-7D13C21F6233</gtr:id><gtr:title>The late positive potential indexes a role for emotion during learning of trust from eye-gaze cues.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d5996fb24ae7b4084a39e95c81103967"><gtr:id>d5996fb24ae7b4084a39e95c81103967</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Manssuer LR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1747-0919</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675e04b86df4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2713C5E6-979D-4B03-9847-8B266854F568</gtr:id><gtr:title>Incidental retrieval of prior emotion mimicry.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experimental brain research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8b6b79e67ad09f489d45fca055c01067"><gtr:id>8b6b79e67ad09f489d45fca055c01067</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pawling R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0014-4819</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcac587e068.60971278</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2AB2BF8F-43B0-4E84-AD3A-A00F917384D3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spatial compatibility interference effects: a double dissociation between two measures.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Visual cognition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/99d73e6dd6eb32a92d45cbbdf0872fa2"><gtr:id>99d73e6dd6eb32a92d45cbbdf0872fa2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kirkham AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1350-6285</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>57f3bc19073731.83455618</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>78536F8E-458D-4105-A1CB-D2F61ADF7C2C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Incidental learning of trust: Examining the role of emotion and visuomotor fluency.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental psychology.
