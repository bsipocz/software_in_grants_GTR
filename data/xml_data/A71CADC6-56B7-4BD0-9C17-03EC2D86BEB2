The major benefit for contractors in using the large diameter multi-functional drilling system was its ease of use in both vertical and horizontal drilling applications. Whilst the company developed its potential use in reverse circulation environments, the company quickly recognised that when reviewing this technology there were major failings when using existing concentric drilling systems and reverse circulation systems where new construction sites adjoined existing buildings. These failings resulted in the de-stabilisation of the geological sub-structure causing major structural damage and, in some instances, buildings that have become unsafe. Through working with senior structural engineers, drilling contractors and building site health and safety inspectors the problems with pneumatic drilling systems used in these environments have been identified with the industry considering the necessary courses of action that overcome such problems.
However, with similar occurrences becoming more regular in 2008, both temporary and longer term changes are likely in the future. The existing short term solution has been to employ fluid flushing systems. However, Bulroc is aware of major problems in the use of this type of technology in terms of geological destabilisation. The second type of technology under consideration is a more costly combined air and fluid flushing system which Bulroc has developed around 10 years ago, but the company believe is not the answer. The technical team at Bulroc believe that all the problems with substructure
de-stabilisation relate to the use of high volumes of flushing media (either compressed air or water) around the face of the drilling bit during operation which forces this media into the ground, causing both short term and longer term de-stabilisation. The company's proposed project would be the research, design and development of a revolutionary approach to flushing and cuttings removal. The proposal provides an introduction to the development providing aims and deliverables which assists in the measurement of overall progress, a reasoning for why the technology is required, project costs and durations, project location where the research, design and development would be undertaken, and why the grant for research and development would be needed in order for the project to go ahead. The technical aspects of the project (Section B: Technical Work Plan) are covered in the technical work programme which provides information on the research and development tasks to be undertaken and the anticipated technical risks which the company face during the project. The technical methodology is also detailed and provides an indication as to how the company plans to overcome areas of major technical uncertainty during the development project. The project phases break down the major project areas into specific work packages which help the company to identify castings for the project phases. A detailed project cost breakdown is provided, together with an indication as to how the company would fund its contribution to the project. The marketability of the proposed new drilling system is described in Section C. This section of the proposal provides background on the market including its size, geographical limitations, potential customers together with the company's exploitation plan, unique selling points and how Bulroc plans to protect the technology using different forms of intellectual property. The company has already submitted a provisional patent which is included in the Appendices of the project proposal. The final section of the proposal D: Business Development Plan, provides information on the background of the company, its previous support and how the business is moving forward with its existing products, and in what markets. This provides ample evidence that the company has exploited its previous major development projects, and provides full details on the position of the company and its plans to develop International markets in the future. The company is one of the world leaders in the design and development of pneumatic down the hole equipment and has re-established its strong position in terms of new products and technology from its once dominant position in the early 1980's when the equipment was in its infancy. The final section of the proposal also covers the impact the proposal would have on the company in consolidating the company's position within the industry, and positioning Bulroc for further growth in export markets as the civil engineering and construction markets recover into the next decade and beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">730069</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
