While many people can be encouraged to recycle by providing adequate facilities, it is very difficult to change other waste-related habits. At the same time, governments have become less willing to introduce expensive regulation. Consequently there is great interest in low-cost, socially acceptable policies that help support behaviour change. The plastic bag charge (PBC) that is going to be introduced in England in October 2015 can be seen as such an instrument. Previous research has shown that PBCs are popular, easy to implement, and can successfully reduce plastic bag use (Convery et al. 2007; Poortinga et al. 2013).

Some policy-makers hope that the benefits may go even further, in that changes to a relatively simple behaviour may lead to other, more ambitious changes (Defra 2008). The first behaviour change may serve as a 'foot in the door' to help establish experiences that may subsequently lead to other changes - also known as behavioural spillover (Thogersen &amp;amp; Crompton 2009). This holds the promise that significant cost-effective changes can be made without burdensome regulation. Indeed, previous research conducted by the applicants found significant changes in environmental identity after a similar carrier bag charge was introduced in Wales in October 2011 (Poortinga et al. 2013). However, there is very little evidence of behavioural spillover in the environmental domain.

The overall aim of the project is to generate high-quality field-experimental and qualitative evidence of lifestyle change and potential BSO resulting from the English PBC. The introduction of the English PBC is a unique opportunity to conduct this research, as it is a relatively simple instrument that aims to change a specific and common waste-related habit. However, little is known about the lifestyle impacts of a PBC. The observation that even small charges produce great changes, suggests that a PBC acts as a 'habit disruptor' that forces shoppers to rethink their plastic bag use, rather than as an economic instrument (Poortinga 2013). Furthermore, as 'bringing your own bag' is a highly visible and symbolic behaviour, it may change how people perceive themselves in terms of waste-consciousness. This then may lead to other waste-related behaviour changes.

The project builds upon previous research of the applicants (Poortinga et al. 2013), but will expand the scale and depth of the study by conducting a mixed-method longitudinal programme of work, including (1) a novel field experiment, (2) a qualitative diary study, and (3) secondary data analyses, to examine in detail how effective a PBC can be; how it works; and whether it can produce behavioural spillover. It will use Wales and Scotland as comparators to allow the effects of the English PBC to be separated from other trends in carrier bag use and waste practices. Furthermore, the proposed project uses secondary data analysis and a behaviour mapping exercise to identify the most likely candidates for behavioural spillover.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project constitutes an ambitious multi-method programme of work that will create an in-depth understanding of lifestyle change and behavioural spillover following the introduction of a plastic bag charge. The beneficiaries of the research are diverse, encompassing academic peers from the social science community, and a range of non-academic users of the research. The non-academic beneficiaries of this research include: i) policy-makers and practitioners at the national level (Defra), ii) devolved administrations and regional bodies (Welsh Govt Scottish Govt, Northern Ireland Executive); iii) organisations engaged in waste and environmental quality (e.g. WRAP; the 'Break the Bag Habit' campaign coalition); and iv) interested publics.

Ensuring that the research impacts beneficially upon such a diverse array of users is a challenge. However, the research team has a strong track record and experience in research engagement, and has already started to engage key users at the pre-submission stage. We are open to critical feedback from experts and policy makers external to the project team, hence our intent to form a Project Advisory Board that will provide assistance in identifying any theoretical and practical policy gaps in the work. Letters of support from relevant bodies provide evidence of our engagement with potential users of the research prior to submitting the proposal, and our plans for a targeted process of engagement with key users of the research. 

Findings will be disseminated through high-impact academic journals (e.g. Global Environmental Change; Journal of Environmental Psychology) and will be discussed at symposia and conferences (e.g. International Association for People-Environment Studies conference; International Congress of Applied Psychology). Beyond the publication of results in academic journals and presentation at symposia/conferences, there are three key routes by which non-academic beneficiaries will hear about and benefit from the proposed research:

1) Dissemination Meetings (London, Cardiff) and the production of a key findings brochure.
The principal results will be launched via a major policy dissemination meeting at the Royal Society to academic and policy communities. The focus of the Understanding Society Survey analysis on the Welsh charge warrants a separate workshop for Welsh policy makers in Cardiff. Both events will not only allow for communication of results by the project team but also for stakeholder participation, with attendees encouraged to reflect critically on both our data and methodologies. The practitioner brochure will present headline findings and practical implications, and will be disseminated widely beyond this event, through the networks of participants at the launch and downloadable via our website.

2) Project Advisory Board
An advisory board with six members will provide critical feedback on the design and direction of the research. The board will comprise policy stakeholders, NGOs, and two independent academic advisors. Academic members will advise on the theoretical and methodological integrity of the research, while involvement of government and NGO representatives ensures that the research remains policy relevant. The advisory board also constitutes a vehicle for the direct dissemination of results to users of the research.

3) Public Discussion Blogs and Website 
Traditional methods of academic publishing are no longer sufficient with a growing demand for research to have a more profound impact on policy and society. Interactive social media (e.g. Website, Twitter, blogs) will be used to make the findings available to the wider public, where it is free to be read, discussed, and used. These interactive forms of communication are used to enter into a conversation with publics and parties that previously would not have had access to the research. This opens up the research for feedback to make a contribution to broader civil society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>381207</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Guardian 2016 (1)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>29152D43-5443-4DFC-9610-CD27DADE403C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Guardian (Shoppers in England now far more likely to use their own bags) Feature article by Adam Vaughan.

The project used a mixed-methods longitudinal approach, and included a national survey, a diary-interview study, and supermarket observation study. The key results for the three elements are summarised below:

The longitudinal survey
? The longitudinal survey was developed to examine changes in behaviours and attitudes following the introduction of the English plastic bag charge.
? A representative sample of the public in England, Wales, and Scotland were surveyed one month before (n=3,066), and then one month (n=2,005) and six months (n=1,230) after the introduction of the English plastic bag charge. 
? We find an immediate change in bag use after the charge was implemented. Whereas before the charge about 1 in 4 respondents from England &amp;quot;Often/Always&amp;quot; took single-use plastic bags doing their main and top-up food shop, this fell to around 1 in 10 respondents one month after the charge was introduced.
? In contrast, before the charge 70% of respondents from England &amp;quot;Often/Always&amp;quot; took their own shopping bags, which increased to 83% of respondents one month after the charge, and to 93% of respondents six months after the charge was introduced. 
? The analyses indicate that the introduction of the plastic bag charge led to a substantial increase in people taking their own bags, independent of age, gender, or income. Although some differences remained between different groups, similar increases were observed for all groups considered.
? A small majority (52%) already supported a 5p plastic bag charge before one was introduced in England. Support for a charge further increased to 60% one month after, and to 62% six months after the English charge was introduced. An increase in support was observed for both men and women, as well as for different age and income groups.
? Support for a 5p plastic bag charge also increased in Wales and Scotland over the same period, with similar levels of support observed in Scotland as in England (61%), and very high levels of support in Wales (80%).
? Not only did people become more supportive of a plastic bag charge after its introduction, they also became more supportive of other charges to reduce waste. In particular, those who changed their opinion about the plastic bag charge also changed their opinion about other charges.
? Respondents from all three UK countries see plastic bag charge as a highly effective policy to reduce plastic bag use. Before the introduction of the English plastic bag charge, 76% of respondents from England agreed that it would encourage people to use fewer plastic bags. This increased to 80% six months after the charge was introduced.
? Respondents from England became far less sceptical about the charge after it was introduced. Before its introduction, two thirds of respondents from England (65%) thought that stores would use the charge to make more money. This decreased to 47% one month after the charge, and to 39% six months after the charge was introduced.
? No evidence was found to suggest that the bag charge led to any changes in shopping behaviour.
? There is evidence of Bags for Life accumulating in people's homes, with people in Wales having the largest numbers of Bags for Life at home.

The diary-interview study
? The diary-interview study aimed to provide an in-depth account of the process of behaviour and attitude change. Semi-structured diaries were followed by semi-structured one-hour interviews before (n=57 and n=52, respectively) and after (n=45 and n=43, respectively) the plastic bag charge was introduced in England. The three samples in England, Wales and Scotland were balanced in terms of age, gender, socio-economic profile, urban/rural location, and were geographically varied.
? The English plastic bag charge was highly effective at reducing the strength and automaticity of habitual use of single-use plastic bags, and replacing it by a planned and more conscious use of Bags for Life. People changed their behaviour for both financial and environmental reasons. 
? There was a high level of awareness in England of the plastic bag charge coming into effect, and participants adapted easily and quickly to the charge. Support for the charge was already high before its introduction, and increased after the charge came into effect, most likely due to the understanding of its environmental benefits. A majority of participants in the three countries supported a 'blanket', exemption-free plastic bag charge.
? After the introduction of the charge in England, people experienced more encouragement from supermarkets to reuse bags. They also saw less need for both single-use plastic bags and plastic Bags for Life to be provided in supermarkets. This was corroborated by the interviews conducted in Wales and Scotland.
? Most participants stopped using single-use plastic bags as bin liners after the plastic bag charge was introduced in England. However, in Wales and Scotland a small number of people continued to use both single-use plastic bags and Bags for Life as bin liners.
? After the introduction of the charge in England, there was an increased awareness of the environmental impact of household plastic waste, and interview participants became more supportive of hypothetical charges to reduce waste. Support for a hypothetical rise in fuel duties rise was lower due to its feared impact on families' budgets, a lack of suitable alternatives to driving, and a need to develop the use of renewable energy sources.

The supermarket observation study
? We observed supermarket shoppers in England and Wales in July 2015 (n=819 and n=818, respectively) and in July 2016 (n=984 and n=1,143, respectively), exiting four supermarkets in both Cardiff and in Bristol.
? In England, over half of all shoppers (57%) were seen using single-use plastic bags before the charge was introduced. This fell to just 21% after the charge was introduced.
? In England, about 29% of all shoppers were seen using Bags for Life before the charge was introduced. This doubled to 58% after the charge was introduced.
? After the English plastic bag charge was introduced, bag use in England matched observed bag use in Wales, where a bag charge was already in place for several years.
? In England, no substantial changes were seen in the number of shoppers using personal bags (e.g., rucksacks), and no changes in the proportion of people carrying items loose without a bag, suggesting that single-use plastic bags have been replaced by Bags for Life.

Conclusions: Overall, the research has shown that the English plastic bag charge has made a strong and positive impact on people's behaviours and attitudes.
The research found that the charge was effective at breaking old habits, and that it became more popular as people adapted to the policy. Evidence was also found that the charge increased environmental awareness and the acceptability of other environmental policies.
The success of the plastic bag charge in effectively changing plastic bag use and increasing support for other charges to reduce waste suggests that similar policies could also be successfully implemented, such as a deposit return scheme on plastic bottles or a charge on disposable coffee cups.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In several
