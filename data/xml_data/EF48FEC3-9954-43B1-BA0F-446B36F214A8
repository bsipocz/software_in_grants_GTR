A wealth of genomic data is fast becoming available, and it is important to take advantage of this and apply it to answering specific questions about gene function and embryonic development. 
Organiser regions in the embryo provide a source of signals that instruct cells to specific identities. The isthmus organiser (at the boundary of the midbrain and hindbrain) is crucial to the formation of the tectum and cerebellum, and the signalling molecule FGF8 is fundamental to this organiser activity. Despite this, it is not known how the isthmus organiser or Fgf8 expression is established at the boundary. This proposal therefore addresses this important question by using chick and zebrafish as model systems to investigate isthmic inducing signals, and to characterise a number of novel genes already isolated in a targeted screen for such signals. Our findings will provide insights into midbrain-hindbrain development, and more general signalling pathways. Failure or mis-regulation of such signalling processes is implicated in human disease, for example, oncogenesis. Therefore, in the longer term these studies may provide an understanding of the molecular basis of disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The isthmus organiser at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary provides a source of signals, mediated by FGF8, crucial for the formation of midbrain (tectal) and hindbrain (cerebellar) structures. Despite this, the signals that lead to its own induction remain unknown. Positioning of the isthmus organiser within the neuroepithelium is dependent on the interface of Otx2 and Gbx2 expression domains, yet in the absence of either or both of these genes, Fgf8 (and other isthmic genes) is still induced. It has been proposed that vertical signals may be responsible for the initial induction of isthmic genes, yet evidence suggests that these genes are specified prior to the formation of proposed inducing tissues.
My goal is to understand the mechanisms by which Fgf8, and the isthmus organiser, are induced at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. My approach will be twofold, using a combination of microsurgical and molecular techniques. Firstly, using chick to perform micromanipulations, I will investigate basic properties of the isthmus organiser with respect to timing of specification, to uncover the source of inducing signals in the embryo. Secondly, using both chick and zebrafish, I will characterise a number of novel clones already isolated from screens undertaken to identify molecules involved in Fgf8 regulation. Their candidacy as Fgf8/isthmus inducing molecules will be tested in both loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays. The information gained will be essential for our understanding of both fundamental patterning mechanisms and specifically, the cell signalling events that regulate formation of the isthmus organiser.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2003-01-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>597290</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G120/728</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
