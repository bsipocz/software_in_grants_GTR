Ever since the seminal work of Wigner in the 1950s, random matrix theory has attracted wide attention in both mathematics and physics. An important reason is the truly remarkable fact that statistical properties of large random matrices -- such as, e.g., the mean spacing of eigenvalues -- can be used as an effective model for a wide range of phenomena. Striking examples include highly excited states of heavy nuclei, the limiting distribution of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and the enumeration of maps or graphs 'drawn' on surfaces.

Depending on according to which distribution the elements of the matrices are chosen, one obtains different so-called ensembles of random matrices. Some of the most important and widely used are the Gaussian Orthogonal (GOE), Unitary (GUE) and Symplectic (GSE) ensembles: they are not only directly relevant to numerous applications but can also be understood in great detail. These ensembles are all contained in a one-parameter family known as the Gaussian beta-ensembles, where beta is any positive real number. This family of ensembles is not only interesting and important in its own right, but also provides a unifying point of view on the classical GOE, GUE and GSE ensembles. Although recent years has seen a surge in both interest and striking new results, the Gaussian beta-ensembles remain far from as well understood as these classical cases.

The main aim of the proposed research is to bridge an important gap in the literature on Gaussian beta-ensembles: to determine the behaviour of averages of products and ratios of characteristic polynomials of random matrices drawn from such ensembles for large matrices. These averages are important in numerous applications, and they are also fundamental to random matrix theory itself. In addition, it would provide a unifying point of view on corresponding recent results for the GOE, GUE and GSE ensembles. In order to achieve this aim we will exploit a direct connection to integrable partial differential operators of so-called (deformed) Calogero-Moser type. This connection provides powerful techniques and results from the theory of partial differential operators in particular and Calogero-Moser operators in particular. Moreover, the proposed research will thus lead to important new results also on (deformed) Calogero-Moser operators.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As is highlighted throughout this proposal, random matrix theory is a large and heterogenous field with connections to a multitude of other research disciplines. Applications range from optics and chaotic physics via financial applications through to ribonucleic acid (RNA) folding. It is therefore reasonable to expect that progress on a fundamental object or problem in random matrix theory will have a great impact across a range of applications, even though it is hard to predict exactly how and on which applications. In time this has the potential to generate a strong wider impact on society.

The key objects of this proposal - averages of products and ratios of characteristic polynomials - are fundamental objects in random matrix theory. In particular, they contain information on eigenvalue correlations. Furthermore, such averages have appeared in a number of applications. For example, in connection with number theory and the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and in chaotic physics.

If the objectives of the proposed research were achieved, then this would benefit numerous academics working in random matrix theory, since it would provide a better understanding of eigenvalue correlations in the Gaussian beta-ensembles, and a uniform point of view on such correlations for the classical Gaussian Orthogonal, Unitary and Symplectic ensembles. Due to the fundamental role of the key objects of this proposal, it is reasonable to expect that in time the proposed research would have an impact on a wide range of applications. As we have indicated above, among them are applications within the realm of both the wider economy and society.

Of central importance to the proposal is the opportunity to employ and, through the proposed research, train an RA. The objectives of the proposal would thus have an important impact on the future research career of the RA, and, as is often the case, is in this way likely to lead to further developments in random matrix theory and related fields even after the completion of the proposed research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98890</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Thus far my findings have not generated any impact beyond academia.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DBB21254-E5CF-4EB4-A6E1-E533175A19E0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5448c619e7a862.86326622</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Random matrices are square (or, more generally, rectangular) arrays of numbers that are drawn at random according to some probability distribution. This project is focused on exploring a relationship between so-called beta-ensembles of random matrices and particular integrable partial differential operators of so-called deformed Calogero-Moser type.

Thus far we have obtained a number of results on such operators and their eigenfunctions that we believe are applicable to the study of beta-ensembles. This includes the construction of kernel functions as well as a new physical interpretation of a deformed Calogero-Moser type operator and corresponding orthogonality results for their eigenfunctions. In addition, we have begun to apply these results to so-called Jacobi beta-ensembles.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We believe that our results in the publication Source identities and kernel functions for deformed (quantum) ruijsenaars models; will be used to construct eigenfunctions of deformed Ruijsenaars model. At the moment these models are far from well understood and their is great scope for future developments.

We also believe that the other results obtained within this project, as described above, will be applied in the study of characteristic polynomials of random matrices from beta-ensembles.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>939D796C-8D3D-407E-9A16-78B08998975D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5448c7a20d46b4.01605636</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F05F5FD-A00E-4915-A48C-6F91251942A8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Source Identities and Kernel Functions for Deformed (Quantum) Ruijsenaars Models</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Letters in Mathematical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5950f802ecc7ffb751c6536b3ca70b27"><gtr:id>5950f802ecc7ffb751c6536b3ca70b27</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Atai F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54196182167f50.55171272</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BDDD0B55-A498-48AF-B6E4-DD2C5942DD6B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Complex Exceptional Orthogonal Polynomials and Quasi-invariance</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Letters in Mathematical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/02b43416d6cfdc3f66f561c343b191fd"><gtr:id>02b43416d6cfdc3f66f561c343b191fd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haese-Hill W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d56e30ff779.41224976</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K010123/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
