Working in partnership with BST and the Johannesburg Holocaust &amp;amp; Genocide Centre (JHGC), the project will use the exhibitions, archive and other resources of JHGC to create a set of digital educational materials that will explore the lessons that can be learnt for South Africa today from the ethnic violence of the Holocaust and the Rwandan Genocide. The project will draw on the research findings of Cooke's AHRC project 'Experiencing the Digital World: the Cultural Value of Digital Engagement with Heritage' on the ways in which the co-production of digital heritage assets can, when time and resources permit, genuinely connect grassroots communities with heritage institutions, effecting a fundamental shift in the relationship between the two. Over the course of the project, the group will work together to make a range of digital resources, the precise nature of which will be decided via a process of knowledge exchange and co-produduction. It is envisaged that the project will produce short films, video and photographic essays, curate small digital exhibitions, research family histories or produce creative writing, all of which will be presented in such a way as to raise questions, draw comparisons with, and prompt discussion about the rise of contemporary xenophobic violence in South Africa. These resources will then be used as part of an educational programme to be rolled out across, and embedded within, the wider educational activities of all the CBOs. 

In so doing, the project will give BST the opportunity to further strengthen the CBOs, as well as explore new means of building the confidence and resilience of the children and young people supported. It will provide a safe space for the exploration of the highly sensitive issues around xenophobia and empower young people to consider root causes, consequences and means of resolution within their own communities. This will have the impact of helping to challenge prejudice at community level, leading to greater prioritization of xenophobia by community leaders and help identify long term and sustainable community-led solutions. The project will also give JHGC the opportunity to undertake a sustained period of work with CBOs that have a far more diverse demographic than the visitors they have worked with hitherto. It will develop the digital skill-base of colleagues working at the centre, allowing them to undertake future digital co-production projects, exploring how digital tools can provide new and better ways to deliver its broader mission 'to use the history of the Holocaust and Rwandan genocide to intervene directly in contemporary debates on human rights abuses, xenophobia, racism and bigotry'. The material produced will be incorporated into the centre's online offering and will be freely available to all. A selection of the materials will also be exhibited as a digital installation at the centre itself. 

Thus, the project responds to the 'Highlight Notice for International Development'. It will 'catalyse knowledge exchange, shared learning and capability development' between cultural organisations and diverse community groups and 'explore ways that arts and humanities research can inform approaches to inclusive participatory decision-making, community engagement, co-production, social innovation and user-led service design in an ODA recipient country', in order to make 'a significant contribution to the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development', specifically, Goal 16 to 'promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies', by 'challenging discrimination' and supporting 'participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will be able to significantly enhance the impact of our original research project, finding new applications within the international development sector for the digital engagement that heritage professionals seek to achieve and which was investigated in detail in the original project's 'Critical Review'. 

The project will allow The Bishop Simeon Trust (BST) to raise awareness of, and challenge, xenophobia in 20 Citizen Based Organisations (CBOs) it works with in townships across Gauteng, via an educational programme that will be sustainable in the longer term. For the last 25 years, the CBOs supported by BST have helped young people to address the key social challenges they face, including the exploitation of vulnerable children, HIV/Aids, drug and alcohol abuse, gender-based and ethnic violence. In the process, they support communities to develop strategies for child protection, behaviour change, and advocacy tools that can provide their communities with an effective political voice. Challenging xenophobic violence is currently a priority issue for the BST. The growing social deprivation of townships across Gauteng facing a weakening economy, worsened by the impact of HIV/AIDS, has, since 2013 but even more pronouncedly since 2015, seen a radical increase in racially-motivated attacks. The project will provide a safe space for the exploration of this highly sensitive issue. Furthermore, it will support BST's efforts to develop the leadership capacity of its CBOs, providing a skills development opportunity for its peer educators, helping their communities to confront this issue and develop their own solutions to it, and thus enhance the sustainability of BST's international development work, specifically addressing the 16th UN Sustainable Development Goal to 'promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies', by 'challenging discrimination' and supporting 'responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels'. 

The project will allow the Johannesburg Holocaust and Genocide Centre to realise the practical potential of the original project's findings on the ways in which digital tools can support the co-production of museum exhibitions with diverse audiences. JHGC, which is a newly opened centre and part of South Africa's National Holocaust and Genocide Foundation - a partner on the original project -, is currently using the original project's research findings to develop its digital strategy, with the aim of maximizing the demographic diversity of its visitors, in particular seeking to engage communities that live in the townships outside of urban Johannesburg. It is also exploring how digital tools can provide new and better ways to deliver its broader mission 'to use the history of the Holocaust and Rwandan genocide to intervene directly in contemporary debates on human rights abuses, xenophobia, racism and bigotry'. In particular, the project will use the centre's exhibitions, participating survivor community and wider archive to develop bespoke, community-specific digital materials designed to challenge the recent growth in xenophobia. These materials will be incorporated into the JHGC's online offering and will also provide the centre with a digital installation to be exhibited at the centre itself. It is anticipated that the project as a whole, and the installation in particular, will significantly enhance their visitor experience, helping both to increase footfall and to diversify their visitor demographic.

Finally, via the project website and the various celebration events planned for the end of the project, to which the wider professional networks of both BST and JHGC will be invited, the materials produced by the project will be widely disseminated and used by other community groups, heritage and international development professionals wishing to undertake similar educational projects aimed at tackling xenophobia in, and beyond, South Africa.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80626</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P005268/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1C8BB85-9786-48E9-AB22-7CE39428AFD3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>German, inc.
