Regenerative Medicine has the potential to transform medicine and provide treatments and cures in areas of unmet need. Cell therapies using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are increasingly applied in clinical trials in areas such as stroke, heart disease and as adjuvant therapies for cancer. However, with all emerging technologies, there are a number of barriers to evaluating their potential effectiveness that need to be addressed, which is localised delivery to target tissue and functionality of the cells once in situ. The focus of my research programme will be to provide multi-modal cell labelling agents for complimentary imaging technologies that can be utilized together to provide a clear understanding of the mechanisms of delivery and uptake with functional cell survival so that scientific beneficiaries (academics, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, regulatory authorities) are able to accelerate these new medicines to other areas of regenerative medicine as well as translation to the human population with full confidence.

The monitoring the delivery and tracking the viability of cells once transplanted into patients is of particular importance not only for the assessment of both the degree and duration of therapeutic efficacy but also for patient safety. Identification of the optimal route of administration, the degree and longevity of cell uptake and routes of clearance can identify possible organs of risk while potentially limiting the number of repeat injections or surgeries required per patient. 

Iron oxide nanoparticle have shown promise in localizing stem cells to defined areas of disease by magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and a number of these nanoparticles have been previously been approved for clinical use. However, they do not currently display the necessary characteristics for the sensitivity that is required to track transplanted cells or provide information on their functionality in vivo. However, other imaging modalities such as nuclear medicine (SPECT/CT) are capable of tracking cells throughout the body, albeit with poor resolution and with new developments in molecular biology are capable of assessing cell viability in vivo. However, at present one imaging modality and one imaging probe cannot provide the information required for the complete characterization of cell therapeutics. 

The new technologies we propose therefore combines innovative molecular biology approaches with nanochemistry to generate multi-modal imaging MSC for in vivo imaging with complimentary preclinical imaging modalities (MRI, SPECT/CT, photoacoustic and bioluminescent imaging). We aim to label cells with both reporter genes and nanopartlces, uniting imaging platforms and imaging probes to utilize the most favourable components of each while reducing their limitations. We will then utilize this to quantify delivery and monitor the localisation and viability of transplanted cells to clinically relevant models of tumours. We will identify the optimal routes of administration and the longevity of cell survival and apply this knowledge to optimize the subsequent application and dosing regimens of our therapeutic MSCs as anti-cancer delivery vehicles. Although this proposal is based on stem cells as adjuvant therapies for cancer the use of our labelling technologies for cell trafficking can be applied to other stem cells and regenerative medicines. Merge this with clinically translatable MR imaging endpoints to provide a full assessment of the efficacy of the cell therapy will therefore accelerate these therapies into mainstream clinical practise.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work proposed here addresses the current barriers that are essential for the clinical translation of stem cell therapies to the clinic. The ability to accurately track stem cells to their target site and monitor their cell integrity over time by providing important molecular biology and nanoparticle tools for imaging regimes it is anticipated that this proposal will an impact on a significant number of beneficiaries. 

1. Academia: Due to multi-disciplinary approach of the proposal the novel techniques developed in will have a direct benefit for academic centres (both nationally and internationally) that are working on cellular therapeutics. As the UK is one of the leading investigators of stem cell research, this will enhance the competitiveness cell therapy groups within the UK for the translation of cellular therapies to the clinic. The advances in physical sciences, life sciences and imaging methodologies have the potential for impact within their own specific disciplines and can be utilized for numerous applications and will be disseminated through the most appropriate channels. 

2. Industry: This proposal will potentially impact on a number of industrial sectors. As the commercial cell therapy industry increases nationally and internationally and with the set up of investment schemes such as the &amp;quot;The TSB Catapult&amp;quot; to accelerate translation to the clinic, there will be a significant change for exploitive investigations of stem cell therapies within leading markets and established pharmaceutical industries. Developing techniques that can provide a predictive measurement of tumour delivery with therapeutic outcome are also of great interest to pharmaceutical companies. Lastly, product companies such as novel imaging/devices companies and contrast agent development companies that specialize in biofuntionalisation of nanoparticles for diagnosis, will also be beneficiaries.

3. Third sector: The charitable investment in regenerative medicine at present reflects the funding for an emerging technology. It is therefore anticipated that charitable funding will increase significantly. With those such as namely concerned with stems cells therapies but also in this case lung cancer charities such as The British Lung Foundation will also benefit. 

4. The Public: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to benefit to a vast number of diseases, with the potential to change the outcomes of diseases that affect the general well being an entire population. The technologies that we propose to develop in our MSCs are transferable to other models of regenerative disease and other cellular therapies such as T cells. Therefore the advances made by this proposal will be utilized to assess the efficacy of cell therapies and the longevity of their potential treatments that when translated will aid the NHS in patient therapy planning and highlight potential risks. We also recognize that discoveries concerning stem cells attract intense media interest. Therefore, we will utilizing both UCL and specific charities such as those mentioned above to engage with public specific engagement mechanisms such as the Regenerative Medicine Network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>933493</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UK Regenerative Medicine Platform</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UK Regenerative Medicine Platform Safety Hub</gtr:description><gtr:id>C91F0D0E-15E9-4B4D-BFC9-C52E01749D04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is multi-disciplinary involving, chemists, stem cell biologists, safety scientists, nephrologists and hepatologists.

The technique although providing a rapid labelling strategy can be fairly toxic to cells at high doses. Replacing Indium-111 with the PET tracer Zirconium-89 (which also has a similar half life to Indium-111) allows us to use much lower doses of radioactivity due to the increased sensitivity and quantification that PET provides over SPECT imaging. This means that we can potentially also image lower numbers of cells without background uptake shown by nuclear reporter genes.

This work is in collaboration with King's College London (Comprehensive Cancer Imaging Centre) and the UK Regenerative Medicine Platform Safety and Efficacy Hub.

Cells expressing luciferase are labelled with Zirconium-89 oxine or tropolone and tracked in vivo.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8E65BE63-8C4C-45FD-8F62-1871F1D15A78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Zirconium-89 labelled macrophages showed uptake in the lung directly after intravenous injection which then migrated to the liver and bone marrow at day 1. This was confirmed by bioluminescence imaging which showed proliferation of the cells over time. The Zirconium signal could be tracked for approximately 1 month.

Zirconium-89 labelled mesenchymal stem cells also where shown to be in the lung directly after intravenous injection but did not migrate to any other region. Bioluminescence confirmed cell distribution but the signal decreased slowly over a period of 2 weeks indicating that cells did not proliferate but died over this time frame.

Zirconium-89 is being considered for clinical translation for assessing the distribution of mechenchymal stem cells expressing TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) in stage 4 lung cancer patients, as part of the Phase II TACTICAL trial (April 2018). We have shown that at clinical doses of Zirconium-89, cell proliferation, metabolism, or therapeutic effect is not altered by Zirconium-89 labeling and there is no DNA damage. I am working with UCLH Nuclear medicine and Radiopharmacy to implement the labelling strategy as part of the trial.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dea9aa977c66.75708209</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Nuclear direct labelling methods</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The formation of lenti-viral reporter genes for the permanent transfection of Mesemchymal Stem Cells with photoacoustic imaging reporter genes.

Testing of the reporter genes lead to a high transfection efficiency with no effect on cell proliferation or differentiation into 3 different lineages (adipogenic, chondrogenic and oestogenic) than non transfected cells. 

The reporter gene was initially tested in tumour cells lines previously used for tyrosinase expression (non bicistronic) in our lab. In these cell lines I saw similar expression to our previous tyrosinase reporter. However, when we moved to mesenchymal stem cells, although the luciferase was expressed and the cells could be seen by bioluminescence the mesenchymal stem cells did not express the melanin contrast. PCR confirmed expression of the tyrosinase gene, it was therefore concluded that these stem cells were lacking an enzyme further down the melanin synthesis pathway. I also looked at other stem cells and progenitor cells with my collaborators (including the UKRMP Safety Hub) and they found the same thing for these types of cells. I have therefore ceased work on this reporter gene and will focus on the gold direct labelling agents for photoacoustic imaging.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54637183726d57.19001187</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Lenti viral photoacoustic imaging reporter genes</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v9/n4/full/nphoton.2015.22.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>To label an iron oxide with a nuclear imaging tracer to produce a multi-modal direct imaging agent to label cells with.

I initially tried to label a previously FDA approved SPION for MRI called Ferucarbotran (lab grade Resovist) and has been used in my previous research to label my mesenchymal stem cells. Although, Ferucarbotran has a carboxydextran coating and in my paper published in 2014 (http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2014/fd/c4fd00114a?page=search) we describe 3 ways of conjugating a NIR dye to the surface. The degree of carboxyl groups present on the surface was not sufficient for conjugation to a nuclear probe. 

I therefore moved FluidMAG-CT from Chemicell (Berlin) which has known function carboxyl functional groups on the surface. I then modified the DOTA chelator by functionalizing one arm of the DOTA with an amine group. This then formed a peptide bond with the SPION coating. We have since chelated Indium-111 to the DOTA in a reproducible manner and have used this to label mesenchymal stem cells and are now testing cell viability and using this in vivo in animal models.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EB698528-E5C4-43FE-872B-9218C6750FB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At present the preparation of the DOTA-FluidMAG-CT nanoparticle has been completed and I have optimized the chelation efficiency and purification methods of the radioactive tracer. The nanoparticle uptake and toxicity are being tested in vitro in Mesenchymal stem cells.

The particle is able to label 1 million stem cells with 10 Mbq of Indium-111 and 1.4 mg of iron. This is suitable to imaging cell biodistribution by SPECT in vivo and identify localization by MRI. We have used this particle in cells already expressing the gene reporter luciferase to identify cell viability and are assessing cell distribution via different injection routes in control animals. Will then apply to tumour models and magnetic targeting strategies.

Cells are labelled with superparamagnetic iron oxides and then injected via a specified injection route.

Secondly ultrasound guidance negotiates the need for surgery in immunocompromised animals.

So far only the MRI parameter T1 has been applied liver fibrosis but this parameter is effected by both immune infiltration and fibrosis and the change in T1 is minimal. This measure will therefore be confounded by the administration of a cell therapy and does not present a large enough effect size for assessing liver regeneration. Our method is based on the fact that in fibrosis, collagen builds up around the vessels causing stiffness in the vessel wall and reduced vasodilation. Although resting perfusion is not altered in fibrosis vs control mice initiating vasodilation by hypercapnia challenge resulted in increased perfusion whereas fibrosis mice and a reduced perfusion, thereby giving a clear effect range that is not effected by cell therapy to assess organ regeneration.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B4C102AE-D00D-4A1C-8A0B-F9096B9EBE6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Highly significant changes in perfusion derived from hypercapnia MRI was seen as early as 6 weeks in fibrosis mice whereas the gold standard T1 only showed a marginal significant increase. Removing the fibrosis insult and allowing the livers to regenerate naturally for 4 weeks resulted in T1 returning to baseline, whereas hypercapnia MRI still showed some underlying remaining disease. Histology showed that although the liver parenchyma had regenerated there was remaining collagen around the vessels. We therefore conclude that hypercapnia MRI is sensitive enough to measure the extent of liver regeneration where T1 is not. I am now applying this to cell therapies.

A range of gold nanoparticles where tested for photoacoustic signal, silica coated gold nanorods where capable of producing a significant signal and could be clearly defined from that of the haemoglobin within the blood. Whereas, circular gold nanoparticles did not. These gold nanorods have been produced by my collaboration with the UK Regenerative Medicine Platform Safety Hub where they were designed as contrast agents for the iThera MSOT system (Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography).

Gold also exhibits a high X-Ray absorption co-efficient and can be used as a CT contrast agent. The signal intensity in this case is dependent on gold density not shape. Tracking cells by CT is beneficial as CT is widely available in the clinic, is used for lung imaging and is col-localised to nuclear tracers.

mesenchymal stem cells labelled with gold where tested in vivo.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9661B965-6B2F-474E-8BEB-E05FD62AA4AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>All luciferase positive cells labelled with gold nanoparticles (rods or spheres) showed no change in proliferation on internalization of gold. Further work is need to identify if gold alters their phenotype.

Photoacoutic imaging was able to detect 200 thousand cells injected subcutaneously and provided similar contrast to that of tyrosinase (see reporter section). CT could also detect these cells as an area of increased signal intensity for up to 2 months. The corresponding bioluminescence images confirmed that these cells where viable throughout.

We also looked at cell distribution throughout the kidney after intra-renal artery injection (see ultrasound guided injections) and throughout the lung after intra-tracheal instillation. 

The work is being presented a the European Molecular Imaging Meeting in Utrecht on the 8th May 2016 as an oral presentation
