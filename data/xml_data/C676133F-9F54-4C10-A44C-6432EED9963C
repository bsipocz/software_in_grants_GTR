However, despite this longstanding situation, a problem exists where art criticism continues to serve the art-works of these artists inadequately. A peculiar kind of eclipsing has taken place where instead of considering and talking directly about the work, the discussions have emphasised the ethnicity of the artist, and the general problematics of race and identity politics within the art establishment, thus deflecting attention away from how these art-works relate to or have influenced the story of twentieth century art.

Coalesced under the term 'Black-British', this term can be considered as 'a metaphor for a political circumstance prescribed by struggles against economic exploitation and cultural domination: a state of consciousness that people of various pigmentations have experienced, empathized with, and responded to.' (Powell, 1997: 10) Here, the research will aim to elucidate a critical perspective on the complexities of trying to draw essentialist conclusions about the nature of a practice on the basis of national origin or diasporic affiliation.

Black Artists and Modernism, BAM for short, is a 3-year research programme that will investigate the often-understated connections as well as points of conflict between Black-British artists' practice and the art-works' relationship to modernism. Here, the research sees modernism as an unfinished project that is extended in postmodernism, and it will look at what Stuart Hall calls the &amp;quot;conjuncture&amp;quot; of generations of Black-British artists that were 'for' and 'against' modernist dictates. 

By focussing our attention on art-works held in major public collections as well as key exhibitions, the research is designed to reach a wide audience from students and academics to a more general audience for the arts.

The design of the research will produce a wide-range of materials. These include: 

An online multi-media website that will chronicle a national audit of art-works by Black-British artists held in public collections in the UK. 

A series of essays, interviews and videos that discuss key art-works and their inclusion in important collections, as well as historically important exhibitions.

A series of public discussions will gather in places like Birmingham, Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester, London and Paris. Study days and symposia will be focused on signature art-works and exhibition histories looking at the impact of Black-British art on the broader narratives of modern and contemporary art practice. 

New displays will appear at museums like the Tate, as a way to re-think the connection between the art-work and the story of modernism. Working with Illuminations, the arts and media specialists renowned for their arts programming (including the Turner Prize programmes on Channel Four), the aim is to record the unfolding research process. Documentaries will be made for a variety of public media platforms including broadcast television. At the end of the three-year programme an edited book 'The Blackness of Modernism: reconsidering art-works, exhibitions and collecting the work of Black-British artists' will be published by Duke University Press.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Blackness of Modernism: reconsidering art-works, exhibitions and collecting the works of Black British artists book, and the TV/documentary are both important outcomes, for different reasons. The book is the main academic outcome and the documentary is the main dissemination and impact outcome.

The Blackness of Modernism book will address the work of Black-British artists and asks how the art-works function beyond the frame of identity politics and institutional requirements of public engagement to encourage a reconsideration of modernism itself. The calibre of contributors would seek to include: Sarat Maharaj, Kobena Mercer, Courtney J Martin, David A Bailey, John Law, Lubaina Himid, Andrew Dewdney, Yinka Shonibare, Wenny Teo, Guy Brett, Sharon MacDonald, Irit Rogoff, Richard J Powell, Victoria Walsh, Gilane Tawadros and Sara Wajid.

BAM will benefit academics and students working in the fields of art practice, art history, visual studies, curatorial and museum studies, postcolonial and diaspora studies, gender and queer studies, and cultural studies. It is envisaged that artists, curators and cultural critics will benefit from the discussions that emerge during the public discussions (study days and symposia), as well as through the documents published on the BAM website, the broadcast documentary and the concluding book.

Through working with the Public Catalogue Foundation on the National Audit, the BAM database of entries will form hyper-links with the 'BBC Your Paintings' website, as well as contribute to the book.

Through the Curatorial and Museological strands a series of curated displays of art-works in public collections like the Tate, will benefit those museums and the audiences they serve.

BAM will have an intellectual and social impact on academia by providing greater critical resources to affect positive change in a culture of poor attainment differences between black and white students. There will be a considerable amount of original material in a field of practice that has been under-researched. 

The Monographic and Documentary strands will generate learning resources that will be made accessible on the BAM website and will be developed as case studies in the publication. Social-media links to the BAM website will encourage active dialogues and feedback on the BAM programme.

At an extended level, the television documentary will aim to reach a significant audience, with the aim of uncovering the rich contributions that artists of African and Asian descent have made to twentieth century art: the building of this research will be a social asset to the wider community.

The effectiveness of the research programme will be evaluated by an Advisory Panel who will meet a total of seven times throughout the 3-years. The Advisory Panel will be made up of arts professionals and academics.

The planned public discussions (study days and symposia) will test the robustness of the research strands. There will be ten public events in years one and two of the programme, taking place across the UK and culminating in a symposium in France. The practices and discussions that have occurred in the UK, particularly since the post-war period, are internationally viewed as paradigm-shifting. As such the symposium in France will seek to exploit and extend these debates with academics and cultural commentators across Europe.

At the beginning of the research the team will receive oral history training to learn about the technical, theoretical and ethical issues concerned with documenting lived experience. Each researcher is expected to upload interviews (audio or transcripts) to the BAM website.

The research team will also work with Karen di Franco to set up a database for the National Audit entries. Karen will advise on the database architecture, and the structuring of the data-sets.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>722681</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Now! Now! In more than one place (6-15 October 2016), was a display that accompanied the London conference&amp;nbsp;Now &amp;amp; Then Here &amp;amp; There: Black Artists &amp;amp; Modernism&amp;nbsp;at Chelsea College of Arts and Tate Britain. The conference (6-8 October 2016) addressed the understated connections and points of contention between Black-British artists' practice and the work's relationship to modernist histories.
An urge to re-assess the legacies of Black-British artistic practice within a wider discourse of critical themes since the twentieth century, bridged both the conference and the display.
As the title might suggest,&amp;nbsp;Now! Now! In more than one place&amp;nbsp;takes up contradictory positions: as a refrain - in a musical sense, as well as to 'trouble' set boundaries and scold; or, could be read as an insistence on immediacy and presence.
A combination of works, including painting, photography, drawing, print, video installation, sculpture and publications are brought together spanning the second half of the twentieth century to the present. Spatial and temporal relationships unfold with themes that address a sense of place, or invite us to re-think representations of the body and identities beyond the binaries often cited in relation to race, sexuality and gender. The featured artists were Ajamu, Appau Jnr Boakye-Yiadom, Mohini Chandra, Neil Conroy/Lesley Sanderson, Yassmin V Foster, Sheila Ghelani, Ope Lori, Althea McNish, Yeu-Lai Mo, Eugene Palmer, Bharti Parmar, Hetain Patel, Vong Phaophanit/Claire Oboussier, Ingrid Pollard, Denis Williams, and Verdi Yahooda.</gtr:description><gtr:id>975C2888-E824-4D87-A448-BF1B2D5DD521</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The display was attended by approximately 500 visitors over the period of 9 days.

In addition, what became apparent in reading how the paintings held by the Herbert Museum were discussed in the interpretive text, a re-writing of the artist's relationship to art practice and art history needed to be underlined. The re-writing of the interpretive text, thus aimed at reinstating the artworks' relationship to modernism, and not just identity and sociological issues. In addition, the artworks were created in Coventry as a commission initiated by the Coventry West Indian Association, and the project was able to re-establish a relationship between the Association and the Museum.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff6e599abe5.94675703</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>BAM Display: Gavin Jantjes, Korabra Series display, Herbert Museum (2016)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.theherbert.org/whats-on/events-exhibitions/korabra-gavin-jantjes</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of International Visual Art</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Institute of International Visual Arts (Iniva) - Now!

Free Thinking: Artists Sonia Boyce, Isaac Julien, Eddie Chambers and Harold Offeh talk to Anne McElvoy about their art and the influence of the British Black Art movement - which began around the time of the First National Black Art Convention in 1982 organised by the Blk Art Group and held at Wolverhampton Polytechnic. Eddie Chambers has written Roots and Culture: Cultural Politics in the Making of Black Britain and Black Artists in British Art: A History since the 1950s. He teaches at the University of Texas, Austin. Sonia Boyce is Professor at Middlesex University, a Royal Academician and will also have a solo show at the ICA later this year. She is one of the recipients of a Paul Hamlyn Foundation Award. She is also the Principal-Investigator of the Black Artists &amp;amp; Modernism project. Isaac Julien is showing Other Destinies at the Royal Ontario Museum from January and shows at Victoria Miro Gallery. Harold Offeh is an artist, curator and senior lecturer in Fine Art at Leeds Beckett University. His work Covers will feature in Untitled: art on the conditions of our time. Nottingham Contemporary's The Place Is Here brings together around 100 works by over 30 artists and collectives spanning painting, sculpture, installation, photography, video and archival displays from the 1980s. It runs from 04 Feb - 30 Apr 2017. New Art Exchange's exhibition, Untitled: art on the conditions of our time, runs from 14 Jan - 19 Mar 2017 and features 12 British artists each with ties to Africa.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c71842a56715.20008623</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b088jl62</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Work Between Us: Black British Artists and Exhibition Histories</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4B7CCD0-D157-4A16-BAE0-FA0F6AC08FA6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>How do artists of African and Asian descent in Britain feature in the story of twentieth-century art?

 This one-day symposium will unearth the stories behind exhibitions that have put the practices of African and Asian descent artists on Britain's cultural map. Lucy Steeds (Afterall journal), artists Sonia Boyce and Keith Piper, and international curator Paul Goodwin are amongst the speakers discussing ground-breaking exhibitions such as The Other Story, The Image Employed, and the 1992 Bluecoat-initiated project Trophies of Empire. The day will bring to light how these exhibitions came about, what their impact was and how the artworks in them have peppered and punctuated major developments in twentieth-century art.

An urge to reassess the legacies of Black-British artists' practice in the twentieth century and beyond has led to the posing of several questions. Not least amongst them, questions that turn our attention to the varied forms of production throughout that period: 'How do we come to know the work of art?' Conversely, 'How do we come to forget the work of art?' Such questions formed the basis of an inquiry about the kinds of knowledge that becomes sanctioned and legitimated in respect of Black artists' work. To take forward a series of discussions, the conference engaged a set of inter- related arenas of debate, including: artists' practices; art history; curatorial and museum studies; art criticism. Alongside speakers sessions, there were focus sessions that attended to art objects, and the knowledges that mediate them. Throughout, the conference retains an engagement with the practices of Black artists and the ways in which they can be repositioned in relation to Modernism. Conference speakers included: Nick Aikens; Rizvana Bradley; Anjalie Dalal-Clayton; Rachel Garfield; David Dibosa; Paul Goodwin; Isaac Julien; Permindar Kaur; Melanie Keen; susan pui san lok; Courtney J Martin; Kobena Mercer (keynote); Sandy Nairne; Vong Phaophanit &amp;amp; Claire Oboussier; Dorothy Price; Elizabeth Robles; Irit Rogoff; Lucy Steeds; and Zoe Whitley.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c712dee3b518.45260674</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.blackartistsmodernism.co.uk/2016/12/12/nowthenherethere-session1-artistspractices/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nil Yalter seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EAF60CDF-4A9D-42DD-ABCA-66CE2A7FA267</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The seminar on the work of Nil Yalter was organised by Sophie Orlando at FRAC Lorraine, Metz, France, and sought to interrogate the often used vocabulary around the multi-media work of Nil Yalter beyond discussions on anthropology and cosmopolitanism.

Displays have taken place at the Herbert Museum in Coventry and at Chelsea College of Arts. The second display accompanied the conference at Tate Britain, and publications from both displays were made freely available.
Several study days on specific artists and artworks in public collections have also been generative and discursive.
