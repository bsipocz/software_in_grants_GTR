In part, this neglect stems from the difficulty that agencies, advocates and policymakers have in accessing relevant, up to date, and easy-to-use evidence on the extent of violence and its role in undermining other development agendas, such as fighting HIV. For the past two years the Gender, Violence and Health Centre has been leading an assessment of the global prevalence and health burden of child sexual abuse, intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence. The team has searched more than 26 databases in English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese and Russian; screened more than 30,000 abstracts and identified approximately 1,000 studies with information on the prevalence of abuse and its impact on the health of women, men and children.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will systematise this information and produce estimates of the health burden of violence by region and translate the findings into easy to use resources (eg global maps, policy briefs, etc) for policymakers and advocates. In addition, project staff will work with partners to disseminate the findings via conferences, webinars, meetings, and social media. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>92840</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at DFID consultation on HIV policy</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ABB7DD5A-5B0E-4319-989D-76E02CD12B9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This presentation was given in response to a request by DFID to present at a consultation on DFID's AIDS strategy, attended by a broad range of civil society actors.

Lynne Featherstone MP, deputy head of state for development, specifically stayed to hear this presentation, and was visibly surpassed by the global figures on violence presented. The subsequent discussions included a focus on ways to better address the HIV prevention needs of women and girls, and the importance of structural intervention components as part of HIV programmes.

The main headline that most journalists focused on was that one in three women globally are likely to experiencing domestic or sexual violence in their lifetime, which was obtained by combining the figures on the levels of intimate partner and non-partner sexual violence. There was also strong interest in the findings on intimate partner homicide, and the broader health impacts. Alongside the launch of the papers and the synthesis report, and the press releases, each journal did an editorial, that also helped raise the profile of the findings. What was interesting to see was the extent to which health correspondents felt that they had to work hard to justify the issue as being linked to health - illustrating the need to making these health visible more visible. In the UK, some additional interest in the figures was generated by news coverage of Nigella Lawson, that happened the day before the launch. Although we actively did not comment on this, we did see that some journalists used this as a hook to help personalise the figures, and to comment that all women are vulnerable to violence.

A range of key stakeholders were invited to this launch event, including representatives from DFID, who are taking the lead globally in their commitment to end violence against women and girls. This launch was used to synthesise in an accessible format the findings from the global prevalence and health burden analysis and the accompanying prevention review. We targeted this event at key policy makers and NGOs working on violence against women. Attendees included several staff from the UK Department for International Development. The materials developed were kept relatively non-technical, and focused upon highlighting the main messages from each component of the project.

The Gender, Violence and Health Centre at LSHTM worked with the World Health Organization and the South African Medical Research Council to conduct the first global systematic review and synthesis of existing scientific data on the prevalence of two forms of violence against women - violence by an intimate partner (intimate partner violence) and sexual violence by someone other than a partner (non- partner sexual violence). Our findings showed, for the first time, aggregated global and regional prevalence estimates of these two forms of violence, generated using population data from all over the world that have been compiled in a systematic way. The report also details the effects of violence on women's physical, sexual and reproductive, and mental health. The findings were striking:

? overall, 35%of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence. 

? most of this violence is violence by intimate partners. Worldwide, almost one third (30%) of all women who have been in a relationship have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner. In some regions, 38% of women have experienced intimate partner violence;

? Globally, as many as 38% of all murders of women are committed by intimate partners;

? Women who have been physically or sexually abused by their partners report higher rates

of a number of important health problems. For example, they are 16% more likely to have a low-birth-weight baby. They are more than twice as likely to have an abortion, almost twice as likely to experience depression, and, in some regions, are 1.5 times more likely to acquire HIV, as compared to women who have not experienced partner violence;

? globally, 7% of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner. There are fewer data available on the health effects of non-partner sexual violence. However, the evidence that does exist reveals that women who have experienced this form of violence are 2.3 times more likely to have alcohol use disorders and 2.6 times more likely to experience depression or anxiety.

This project, funded by the ESRC, was used to disseminate the findings through a range of fora, and to develop a complementary synthesis of evidence of what forms of violence prevention initiative are effective, with the aim of using these findings to promote a greater recognition of the health impacts of violence, and the need for increased investment in prevention efforts. 

We used a range of fora to disseminate the findings. This included conference presentations, academic publications (including in high profile publications), launch events, blogs, and twitter feeds. This combination resulted in the findings gaining substantial media coverage - with more than 1,500 news items arising from the report, including on television different forms of print media globally, as well as creating substantial online coverage. 

This coverage is likely to be both a result of the figures, as well as our use of a combined dissemination approach, with one on one meetings with key journalists, academic publications and with media launches in Geneva and London. The results have also been used to inform the development of guidelines on the provision of effective health services to women experiencing violence.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings summarised and disseminated from this work provides new, rigorous data on the global prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence against women, and quantitative measures of the health impacts of this violence.

The submission made by GVHC drew on the ESRC funded project, and in particular, our synthesis of the state of current research evidence on prevention, discussions with partners involved in the ESRC project, as well as the groups broader experience at conducting research on violence. Many of these recommendations were included in the final report to DFID produced by the Committee, including a recognition of the high prevalence of violence and its health impacts, the potentially strategic role that the health sector could play in addressing violence, and the limited state of evidence on 'what works', and the need to invest both in promising programmes, as well as in careful evaluation, to ensure that there are opportunities for learning and the sharing of best practise as interventions are scaled up.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r_3941726221d23df97e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B082AEEE-B343-4A35-B550-955BDBDE0EA1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Global health.
