performance in reduced input agriculture</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/H014381/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposal for LINK funded project will build on a solid base of work currently underway, funded through existing LINK programmes, BBSRC, directly by industry, the Scottish Government and the NIAB Trust fund. The proposed study will seek to initiate a better understanding of wheat root growth, morphology and functional relationships with nutrient and water uptake. Methods to describe roots in a diverse range of winter wheat types will be implemented in controlled glasshouse conditions and in the field. The project will form the foundation for improving nutrient sequestration and conversion in this important UK crop through initiation of pre-breeding and development of ideal root ideotypes suitable for use in current and future wheat production. The consortium will concentrate on efficient or enhanced use of resources, especially nitrogen and phosphate and will consider interactions with water availability. In addition, the importance of interactions with beneficial mycorrhizal fungi on nutrient sequestration and the negative impact of soil-borne pathogenic fungi on susceptible genotypes will be considered under field conditions. Finally, the potential impact of agrochemical seed coats on root performance will be assessed. Overall, research in root biology leading to increases in nutrient uptake efficiency will contribute to reductions in diffuse pollution and will substantially reduce green house gas emission due a reduction in the use of nitrogen fertilisers in wheat cultivation</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of wheat root growth and morphology on the efficiency of nutrient uptake and hence yield and to explore how this interacts with selected environmental and agronomic parameters. We will assess the level of genetic variation for root development in a range of genotypes in controlled environments and assess the performance of a sub-set of lines with contrasting root characters under field conditions. Interactions with mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi and the effect of seed coat agrochemical applications will also be assessed. Pre-breeding of improved lines using elite and more diverse germplasm sources will be initiated. The key technical aspects of this work are to identify and develop methods to study root systems in controlled environments and in field experiments for a set of 95-100 wheat lines comprised of genotypes for which there is extensive existing phenotypic information for adaptive traits and which represent a range of diverse types. These methods will be deployed to characterise the root system of the set of wheat lines, and assess nutrient uptake and yield performance in field plots at defined levels of macronutrient inputs, concentrating on nitrogen and phosphorus and selected crop protection chemicals applied as seed coat treatments. We shall also collect samples from the field experiments to assess the potential of wheat genotypes to form mutualistic associations with mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi. In addition the impact of agrochemical seed treatments on both mutualistic and pathogenic interactions will be assessed. Finally, to underpin future research we shall develop a new bi-parental mapping population using genotypes that demonstrate markedly different root growth and morphologyand initiate pre-breeding work with the intention of developing lines in which ideal wheat root ideotypes are combined with ideal above-ground characters typical of high yielding varieties.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This LINK Consortium brings together leading academic experts in crop science, genetics, plant physiology and soil ecology (NIAB, SCRI, ADAS and York University) with first rate industry scientists from four major UK plant breeding companies, two crop protection companies (BASF and Monsanto) and a major player in UK agricultural marketing and services (Frontier Agriculture Ltd). The problems we address are highly topical; Adding information where there has been little prior research on the wheat root system which interfaces the soil environment will add value to the demanding target of security of food production in a changing and increasingly variable climate where water availability is compromised and regulation dictates reduced fertilizer inputs. The potential of this work will resonate with many in the scientific community, in government, governmental organizations and with the general public. Effective exploitation of the results of this research is therefore critical and is specifically what the LINK programme and the industry Consortium is set up for. The breeding companies have the potential to directly exploit the results in their commercial programmes. The crop protection companies marketing seed treatments will benefit from understanding how their compounds interact with root systems. Breeders and crop protection specialists will benefit from a better understanding of the dynamic interactions between roots, beneficial mycorrhizal fungi, soil pathogens and seed coat chemicals. Growers and organizations supplying growers will benefit from new varieties that are high yielding under changing climatic conditions. Each of the academic Centres in this collaborative project have strong track records in delivering research in LINK projects and ensuring that outputs are disseminated and exploited by the industry consortium. NIAB will be the leading Institute and Andy Greenland will co-ordinate the activities described in this programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>225973</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Professional Development Training for Farmers programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>64F59FE9-F772-4634-A378-C17C34B32359</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I participated in two regional seminars for farmers, one at NIAB, Cambridge, the other at Otley Campus, Easton &amp;amp; Otley College, Suffolk.

Root systems are relatively large compared with more commonly explored species in research, and vary with plant genotype, but are also highly dynamic during the cereal growth season and in response to environmental factors such as nutrient availability. This research aimed to quantify root phenotype in UK wheat varieties at four growth stages, using one of two methods: i) a flat bed filter paper based system to characterise roots at seedling stage; and ii) a metre-length rhizotube system to characterise roots at stem elongation, anthesis and maturity. Root responses to nitrogen supply were also assessed using the rhizotube system. We found significant differences between varieties in root size and in rooting depth / shape. The maximum rooting volume occurred at anthesis, with the majority of the root expansion being found between xx cm and xxcm deep in the rhizotubes. The overall increase in root size with development and depth depended on wheat variety but was significantly affected by the length of the growing season to anthesis. Changes in both root size and shape were found into response to nitrogen treatment, and in addition there was evidence of differences in the type of responses between varieties.
We have developed a method to extract wheat DNA from soil and quantify the amount of roots present at depths down to 1m. We show that our qPCR detection system is specific to wheat and barley but will not detect other common agricultural crops. When evaluated alongside the results of root washing from soil cores taken from winter wheat plots in field experiments, our novel method produces comparable results with high correlations between data produced by either method (r = 0.88-0.99 on a plot by plot basis). The relatively high throughput of our assay allowed us to determine the root biomass in samples taken at four depth intervals from a twenty two variety field trail over two seasons. Analysis of our results showed both variety and depth as significant factors in the distribution of root biomass. These results suggest that our assay is a useful tool for investigating the genetic basis of wheat root biomass distribution in field grown crops. 
Plant roots interact with a complex microbial community in the soil, including microbes that enter into the root tissue. Prominent among these are the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which can provide demonstrated benefits for plant growth. Here, we develop an improved tool to describe the diversity of AMF within roots and in the surrounding soil, and test this in a number of different wheat trials, looking at contrasts in treatments and varieties. The approach is to amplify a variable region of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene using AMF-specific primers, and then to pool samples and sequence using the Ion Torrent PGM platform. Reads are clustered into sets at approximately the level of species so that relative species abundance can be determined. The method revealed high species diversity of AMF in both roots and soil, and high spatial variation in communities from one plot to another. Studies will need to be carefully designed to take this variation into account in order to detect the effects of variables such as depth in the soil, agronomic treatments, or crop varieties.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This LINK Consortium brings together leading academic experts in crop science, genetics, plant physiology and soil ecology (NIAB, SCRI, ADAS and York University) with first rate industry scientists from four major UK plant breeding companies, two crop protection companies (BASF and Monsanto) and a major player in UK agricultural marketing and services (Frontier Agriculture Ltd). The problems we address are highly topical; Adding information where there has been little prior research on the wheat root system which interfaces the soil environment will add value to the demanding target of security of food production in a changing and increasingly variable climate where water availability is compromised and regulation dictates reduced fertilizer inputs. The potential of this work will resonate with many in the scientific community, in government, governmental organizations and with the general public. Effective exploitation of the results of this research is therefore critical and is specifically what the LINK programme and the industry Consortium is set up for. The breeding companies have the potential to directly exploit the results in their commercial programmes. The crop protection companies marketing seed treatments will benefit from understanding how their compounds interact with root systems. Breeders and crop protection specialists will benefit from a better understanding of the dynamic interactions between roots, beneficial mycorrhizal fungi, soil pathogens and seed coat chemicals. Growers and organizations supplying growers will benefit from new varieties that are high yielding under changing climatic conditions. Each of the academic Centres in this collaborative project have strong track records in delivering research in LINK projects and ensuring that outputs are disseminated and exploited by the industry consortium. NIAB will be the leading Institute and Andy Greenland will co-ordinate the activities described in this programme.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8D38C7CC-65BB-4923-9713-D4A5EAD7FD51</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460b0ee9e1d83.83003959</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>DNA is extracted from soil core using a PowerSoil kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, USA.) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols.
