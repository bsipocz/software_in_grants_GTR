Devices</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M025977/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>An artificial arm, or prosthesis, is an example of technology that can be used to help somebody perform essential activities of daily living after a serious injury that results in the loss of their arm. Such activities might include eating, washing, opening doors, or shaking hands with a friend. Many artificial arms on the market these days are highly sophisticated, offering individual finger movement, and even movement of segments within a finger, that resemble the natural arm and hand. These prosthetic arms are often controlled by sensing the contractions in the muscles of the remaining arm to which the prosthesis is attached, allowing the user to operate the arm by flexing their muscles. However, one key aspect of artificial arms that is currently missing is the sense of feedback. In other words, the user does not know where the arm is or how wide open the hand is without looking at it, and if a delicate object is picked up, there is no sense of how hard it is being gripped. This leads to slow and awkward use of the artificial arm and prevents its use from becoming truly natural.

The goal of this project is to develop technologies that will enable the next generation of assistive devices to provide truly natural control through enhanced sensory feedback. Our long-term vision is for artificial arms that provide the user with a sense of feedback that recreates the natural feedback associated with a real arm. To enable this level of feedback, we must meet two clear objectives: to generate artificial signals that mimic those of the natural arm and hand, and to provide a means of delivering those signals to the nervous system of a prosthesis user. 

These objectives will be achieved by: building new fingertip sensors to give the prosthesis a realistic sense of touch, including pressure, shear and temperature; developing a 'virtual hand' that mimics the nerve impulses that would be produced by a real hand, giving the user a sense of position of an artificial hand; and designing electrodes and a stimulation system that can deliver the simulated nerve impulses directly to the individual's nervous system.

Building this level of feedback into prosthetic devices will enable much higher levels of function to be achieved than is currently possible. Device users would be able to naturally reach out and pick up a glass, for example, whilst maintaining eye contact in a conversation, or pick up an apple without bruising it. This will advance the field of prosthetics, provide enhanced function to prosthesis users and decrease the learning time involved when acquiring a new device.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work paves the way to restore natural sensation with the development of novel sensors and neuro-biomechanical models that can generate biomimetic sensory feedback signals and electronic systems and neural probes to deliver these signals to the peripheral nervous system.

Society: Nearly 6,000 cases are referred to UK Prosthetic Services every year. In addition to the loss of functionality that losing a limb causes, phantom pain and psychological distress can be severe. The challenge to provide effective prostheses is a recurrent feature of comments from users. It has been a key theme in national reports on prosthetic services in the UK [Chavasse report, 2014] particularly in relation to injured service personnel and survivors of major trauma. These issues are discussed regularly during meetings of the All-Party Parliamentary Limb Loss Group. Beyond prosthetics, loss of sensory integration is widely acknowledged as the major impairment in recovery from musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. In addition, sensory loss contributes to substantial secondary complications of disabling conditions and subsequent disability, such as pressure damage leading to ulcers. The cost to the health service of skin pressure damage is &amp;pound;2.1Bn per year. This is a direct result of people being unable to sense when their skin is at risk of breakdown and includes pressure sores from people inappropriately positioned in beds and chairs. Developing of assistive technologies that can provide sensory feedback to the user will enhance our ability to meet users' needs.

Economy: The results of this project will cement the UK's reputation as the leading location for prosthetic design and manufacture: 3 of 4 major manufacturers of upper- and lower-limb prosthetic limbs are UK-based. The market for advanced prostheses and bionics is growing rapidly. For example, Touch Bionics, UK had a 23% increase in revenues in 2013. Our project will provide significant know-how and novel technologies t help the UK's prosthetics industry stay competitive in a global market. In particular, the project has the potential to open a new era in neural interface manufacturing. In addition, the planned collaboration agreement between project members means that any commercial potential can be rapidly exploited. In addition, technologies that enable delivery of sensory feedback can greatly accelerate recovery and hence reduce NHS costs.

Knowledge: This project will inform the development of a wider range of assistive technology, e.g. smart orthotics and mobility device. For instance, the sensor system developed is the first part of the chain required to generate natural skin-like sensation. The mechanoelectrical transduction methods developed will be scientifically leading and address existing challenges in the filed such as multidirectional force sensing. 

In addition, the development of high-resolution flexible microprobe arrays and at the bespoke electronic systems will be of interest of the wider UK neuroscience community. A low-profile implantable recording and stimulation setup will be an exciting alternative to the very expensive commercial systems already available (~&amp;pound;150k) elsewhere in US and Europe. 

Currently, no neural interface models exist that: (a) can be used in the electrode array design &amp;amp; manufacturing process and (b) includes both electric and mechanical electrode-tissue interactions. Inclusion of mechanical factors will also allow the researchers to predict tissue damage and electrode migration patterns. This project will be the first to have these capabilities.

People: 11 researchers (6 PDRAs and 5 PhD students) will be trained in this truly multidisciplinary project. Working collaboratively and publishing jointly, they will gain knowledge and expertise through the process of solving challenging problems. Follow-up projects both directly and indirectly stemming from this interaction provide further capacity building opportunities</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1444283</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Enabling Technologies for Sensory feedback in next generation assistive devices (SenseBack)</gtr:description><gtr:id>FC93BF58-05EB-4A5F-A644-F89A66635E02</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is multidisciplinary as it involves biomechanics, computing, Electronics and Medicne</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d83191dba750.09218378-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Research is still at an early stage but the wider collaborations and network is expected to lead to further contributions</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Working in conjunction with the partners of the Senseback project, a design specification has been established for which an optical mask has been designed and purchased (Compugraphics International Ltd.). The designs have been made with the intention of being used for neuroscience studies on rats at the Newcastle University. The current mask set, limits the electrodes to a one dimensional array of electrical contacts at the end of a planar needle. It contains a range of different electrode designs allowing investigations into different design parameters.
In order to establish the initial development of the electrodes, current cleanroom fabrication methodologies have been adapted and modified to suit the requirements of the project with an increased focus on fabricating a needle structure. To aid the optimisation process, the project has been split into two parts; electrical and mechanical. In doing this, the fabrication financial and time costs of each test device is reduced as well as allowing a focus to be made on the respective parts. Additionally, for the electrical testing devices which are not in needle form, there is an improved structural rigidity making the devices easier to handle and evaluate.
In optimising the mechanical silicon based dummy electrodes (no electrical elements), focus has been made on using different fabrication techniques to define a side wall profile for the needle which allows the needle to cut into the nerve bundle with minimal applied force and thus damage. Both wet and dry etching techniques have been scrutinised with regards to the fabrication process. These have since been tested by Newcastle University with the feedback being used for further modifications. As well as fabricating hard structures, soft polymer needles have been developed; utilising a photo-patternable polymer, SU8, needles with physical properties closer to biological tissue than for the silicon needles, have been produced with the intention of being applied to chronic applications, with a reduced foreign body response. However, with the reduced stiffness of the polymer electrode, implantation of the needle into and alongside the nerve becomes problematic, struggling to penetrate the nerve or maintaining its shape. This development is part of an ongoing study in this project.
Studies on the electrical elements of the electrodes are conducted on glass coverslips, diced into chips. Initial studies have been made to establish methods for reducing the contact impedance of the electrodes. The accepted methodology is to increase the effective area of the contacts whilst keeping the geometric area constant, and indeed small, the targeted area eventually, is below 10micrometers in diameter. This has been studied in this work through nano-patterning (Raith electron beam lithography) and micro roughening of the host substrate. Further methods have also been studied such as different metal deposition methods and materials. Mounted on printed circuit boards (PCB), the electrochemical characteristics are scrutinised in-vitro using a poteniostat to perform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements. 

Presently, the research infrastructure and basic processes have been established, and we are in the process of bringing the hard silicon needles together with the electrodes, itself mounted onto a PCB for preliminary acute in-situ measurements. In conjunction with this development, a method for implanting soft chronic electrode into the nerves will be determined before progressing to the next stage of the project; to develop two and three dimensional arrays of electrical contacts for soft neural electrode studies.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leeds</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>SenseBack (Newcastle/Leeds/Keele/Essex/Southampton)</gtr:description><gtr:id>7807144B-1EAB-4341-93F0-A14AD039DFD9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bb641180abc0.32843104-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Newcastle - Experimental Neuroscience

In conjunction with this development, a method for implanting soft chronic electrode into the nerves will be determined before progressing to the next stage of the project; to develop two and three dimensional arrays of electrical contacts for soft neural electrode studies.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Southampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>SenseBack (Newcastle/Leeds/Keele/Essex/Southampton)</gtr:description><gtr:id>303D92B9-1CA5-4808-911E-F67BB9E84A3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bb641180abc0.32843104-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Newcastle - Experimental Neuroscience

The designs have been made with the intention of being used for neuroscience studies on rats at the Newcastle University. The current mask set, limits the electrodes to a one dimensional array of electrical contacts at the end of a planar needle. It contains a range of different electrode designs allowing investigations into different design parameters.
In order to establish the initial development of the electrodes, current cleanroom fabrication methodologies have been adapted and modified to suit the requirements of the project with an increased focus on fabricating a needle structure. To aid the optimisation process, the project has been split into two parts; electrical and mechanical. In doing this, the fabrication financial and time costs of each test device is reduced as well as allowing a focus to be made on the respective parts. Additionally, for the electrical testing devices which are not in needle form, there is an improved structural rigidity making the devices easier to handle and evaluate.
In optimising the mechanical silicon based dummy electrodes (no electrical elements), focus has been made on using different fabrication techniques to define a side wall profile for the needle which allows the needle to cut into the nerve bundle with minimal applied force and thus damage. Both wet and dry etching techniques have been scrutinised with regards to the fabrication process. These have since been tested by Newcastle University with the feedback being used for further modifications. As well as fabricating hard structures, soft polymer needles have been developed; utilising a photo-patternable polymer, SU8, needles with physical properties closer to biological tissue than for the silicon needles, have been produced with the intention of being applied to chronic applications, with a reduced foreign body response. However, with the reduced stiffness of the polymer electrode, implantation of the needle into and alongside the nerve becomes problematic, struggling to penetrate the nerve or maintaining its shape. This development is part of an ongoing study in this project.
Studies on the electrical elements of the electrodes are conducted on glass coverslips, diced into chips. Initial studies have been made to establish methods for reducing the contact impedance of the electrodes. The accepted methodology is to increase the effective area of the contacts whilst keeping the geometric area constant, and indeed small, the targeted area eventually, is below 10micrometers in diameter. This has been studied in this work through nano-patterning (Raith electron beam lithography) and micro roughening of the host substrate. Further methods have also been studied such as different metal deposition methods and materials.

? Bring together colleagues, both within the University and external partners, interested in developing tools and technologies for use in preclinical and clinical studies in neuroscience and neurology.
? Initiate interdisciplinary discussions in applied neuroscience research
? Facilitate the formation of interdisciplinary research partnerships, with the intention that these lead, in the future, to the submission of funding bids to external agencies.

The workshop was attended by 35 delegates who collectively had interests which spanned the discipline: 11 Biological Scientists (all UoL); 10 Engineers/Physicists (8 UoL, 3 Ext); 7 Clinically-related (5 UoL, 2 Ext); Research and Innovation Support (4 UoL, 1 Ext).

Delegates were engaged with research goals and needs of different research groupings or fields through short presentations by Chakrabarty (FBS: Basic Neurophysiology), Alix (Univ of Sheffield, Clinical Neurophysiology), Steenson (Eng, Neuroengineering) and Williams (RIS, Medical Innovation). These were followed by the keynote lecture entitled &amp;quot;Monitoring Biochemical Parameters- Diagnostics, wearables and implants&amp;quot; delivered by Prof Dermot Diamond (National Centre for Sensor Research, Dublin City Univ).

Following a panel discussion sessions in which presenters responded to questions from the audience, delegates were allocated to three multi-disciplinary/multi-interest groups, each led by a facilitator, to explore the current and future research questions of neuroscientists and clinicians, the technological barriers they face in undertaking this research, and the tools and technologies that exist or could be developed by engineers or physical scientists to overcome these barriers. 

The outcome led to a Network + collaboration bid which was not funded but dialogue continues with some of those involved re a further responsive mode bid.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d56d04613911.48449007</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Friends of Imperial College &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; tour at NGNI Labs</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0455DB46-8C7E-4D7E-812C-A34CB80624FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Next Generation Neural Interfaces (NGNI) lab hosted a &amp;quot;Behind the Scenes&amp;quot; event for Friends of Imperial College on the evening of 25th January 2017.

However, due to differences in experimental protocols, it is difficult, if not impossible, to make meaningful comparisons
between different neural interfaces. Therefore, standardised experimental protocols and inexpensive hardware to enable systematic comparison of various neural interfaces are necessary. Here, we develop a low-cost, computer-controlled electronic system to standardise the mechanical stimulation of a rat's hind-paw.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF0D9ABD-74A4-4D24-9F3F-5973AE6594BA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This experimental platform will enable the development of further complementary studies towards understanding the underlying mechanisms of sensorimotor control at the neural and behavioural levels.

For the soft layered MEA an insertion tool and post insertion release mechanism, together with a soft and flexible interconnect needed to be developed. The key development was a bespoke end to end hardware and recording tool for both acute and chronic applications. The large number of addressable contacts is considered to help with the 3R's by helping to generate a richer data set requiring fewer animals for the research into neuro-electronics or electrophysiology.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F02C99E7-FD95-4468-B8B2-4459AB28F2B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Still to be reported and related animal studies pending but several related publications are to be expected now that a firm technological base has been established</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd2fbebdb790.38182616</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Development of both hard shank and soft shank microelectrode arrays together with soft flexible interconnect and insertion tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A07FA72-0F99-441C-93F0-3137D1DC011A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Separability of neural responses to standardised mechanical stimulation of limbs.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/379e1fc4521d9ac1fcd8a36919308a7e"><gtr:id>379e1fc4521d9ac1fcd8a36919308a7e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brunton E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8b277fc995b9.85226962</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CA08C979-EFE1-45D7-9A5B-6A53B50BB1BE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Establishing score equivalence of the Functional Independence Measure motor scale and the Barthel Index, utilising the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and Rasch measurement theory.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of rehabilitation medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c87ad5ec178b4c9c8e76dd19172ab80a"><gtr:id>c87ad5ec178b4c9c8e76dd19172ab80a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Prodinger B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1650-1977</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa856ff89e317.06016090</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>18B56CDD-280B-483C-AFB3-BACE9610DF4C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fiber size-selective stimulation using action potential filtering for a peripheral nerve interface: A simulation study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Conference proceedings : ...
