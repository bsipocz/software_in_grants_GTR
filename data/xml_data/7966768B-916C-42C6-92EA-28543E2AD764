Protein molecules, encoded by these genes, seldom act in isolation, but most frequently associate with other proteins to form large complexes. These complexes can perform tasks that are not possible by the constituent proteins. The association into assemblies is the first step that leads to organisation at the cellular level. We are studying these complexes in order to understand how they function. We wish to understand how proteins recognise each other, how they bring about specific chemical reactions, and how they signal to or target other macromolecular complexes. In diseases such as cancer these processes are most often disrupted, leading to escape from the normal processes that control cell growth. Sometimes useful therapeutic approaches can be achieved not through targeting the defective process itself but in targeting an upstream regulation of that process. 

Structural studies using several different methods are the main focus of our work. The specific proteins that we are working with include protein kinases and their role in control of the cell cycle, the process by which a cell grows and divides. There are over 500 protein kinases in the human genome. To target just one of these kinases for therapeutic intervention requires knowledge of the three dimensional structure that can be obtained by X-ray crystallography. We study the anaphase-promoting complex (APC); a large 1 MDa complex that acts to recognise proteins that need to be degraded in order for cells to progress through cell division. The APC attaches a label (poly-ubiquitin) to the protein molecule that sends it to the degradation machinery. By expressing the APC in yeast, individual proteins can be selectively labeled and identified using electron microscopy to produce a picture of how the complex is organised and controlled. The cell membrane is a location of two-way signalling. External events may activate signalling networks within the cell, while internal signals may be transduced to the extracellular environment through modulation of the properties of cell-surface proteins. We are studying four prototypical signalling systems that involve both outside-in and inside-out signalling. In further studies on signalling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm we have begun work on Cid1, a poly(A)polymerase that contributes to checkpoint signalling in the cytoplasm by regulating the polyadenylation (and hence translatability) of mRNAs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The co-operative group will continue studies on the structural basis of assembly in cellular control processes, building on the results achieved during the tenure of the first award. Methods used include protein crystallography, NMR spectrometry and electron microscopy complemented by protein expression and purification and other relevant biochemical and biophysical methods (e. g. isothermal calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, mass spectrometry, fluorescence anisotropy). Structural studies on the yeast anaphase-promoting complex, an eleven-protein ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for degradation, will be extended to 10 ? resolution by EM and studies leading to the location of its constituent proteins and its regulation will be continued. Signalling mechanisms by external events to the inside of the cell and by intracellular events to the outside of the cell will build on ongoing programmes on integrin tails, focal adhesion kinase, the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan receptor CD44, and ZAP70 kinase. Assemblies in cell cycle regulation will be addressed through programmes on substrate specificity in CDK2/cyclin A and CDK2/cyclin E, on checkpoint signalling mechanisms that involve phosphorylated CDK2/cyclin A complexes with the phosphatase Cdc25, on the role of the regulatory protein Cks1 in mediating interactions for the inhibitor p27 degradation with the Skp1/Skp2 complex of the Skp1/Cullin/F-box ubiquitin ligase, on several new protein kinases that have emerged as important players in cell cycle regulation, and on mechanisms by which ubiquitin targets proteins to the proteasome through intermediary proteins. Work on CDK2 specific inhibitors will be developed in collaboration with colleagues at Newcastle with the drive to bring forward a compound for clinical trials. In work promoted by a new member of the Co-operative with cell biology expertise (Dr C. J. Norbury), structural studies on Cid1 related poly(A)polymerases will be initiated. This protein contributes to checkpoint signalling in the cytoplasm by regulating the polyadenylation (and hence translatability) of mRNAs encoding checkpoint determinant(s) in the Chk1 pathway. Polyadenylation of mRNAs in the nucleus promotes their translation following export to the cytoplasm and is an important determinant of mRNA stability. By working together in a co-operative group we are able to address major problems and through use of shared equipment and interchange of experimental skills provide effective use of resources.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1999-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>238348</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G9805941</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
