Children with conduct problems engage in a range of aggressive and antisocial behaviours (e.g. fighting, stealing, bullying), that affect their ability to follow rules and adapt to society, do well in school, and form healthy relationships with peers. Those who do not receive treatment are also at increased risk for many negative outcomes in adult life, including lower job prospects and earnings, more contact with the police and a lower quality of life. As a result, preventing and treating conduct problems is a major public health priority. 

To date, successful treatment has been complicated by the fact that children with conduct problems often experience a number of additional psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression and hyperactivity. Interestingly, studies have shown that many of the factors that increase risk for conduct problems - for example poverty, family conflict, harsh discipline and parental mental illness - also increase risk for these other psychiatric symptoms, pointing to a possible common cause. However, little is currently known about the specific processes by which early adversity increases risk for both conduct problems and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. 

Recent discoveries suggest that what we experience in our environment can influence our development by causing 'epigenetic' changes to gene expression- in other words; by switching specific genes on or off. Animal research has found that early adversity, such as poor maternal care, can change the activity of genes important for how animals will respond to future stressful events, leading to increased anxiety-like and aggressive behaviour. Importantly, this work has also demonstrated that changes to genes may not be permanent, but dynamic over the lifespan and potentially reversible. So far, the small number of existing studies in humans supports the idea tha the environment can influence mental health through epigenetic changes. However, these studies have typically involved adult participants, asked about their childhood experiences retrospectively and included genetic information only at one time point. Therefore, it has been difficult to understand how gene activity changes in response to environmental influences over time, and whether these changes contribute to the development of psychiatric problems in childhood. 

The proposed project will be the first to examine associations between environmental risk, epigenetics and psychiatric problems, starting from gestation through to adolescence. Analyses will be based on data collected from two large groups of children as part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (UK) and Generation R study (Netherlands). These birth cohorts are very unique because they have epigenetic data at multiple times during development. Moreover, they contain data on pre- and post-natal environmental risk, and psychiatric symptoms from early childhood onward. Together, this information will allow us to address three main aims: (i) to trace how environmental risks influence the activity of genes from birth to late childhood; (ii) to establish whether epigenetic changes play a role in the development of conduct problems; and (iii) to examine whether these same changes also contribute to the development of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. 

Through this research, we hope to better understand how early life stress 'gets under the skin' to influence child development. We also hope that by looking at how these processes occur over time, we will be able to pinpoint key developmental windows for prevention. Finally, by examining whether conduct problems and co-occurring symptoms involve common or distinct biological factors, we hope to contribute to the development of more effective treatment strategies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
Given that the proposed project primarily constitutes novel 'basic' research, it is anticipated that the key direct beneficiaries will be researchers working in the fields of developmental psychopathology, biological psychiatry and epigenetics. However, the findings also have the potential to indirectly benefit a range of other users, including professionals working with CP youth (e.g. clinicians, psychologists, social workers), policy makers interested in translating basic scientific findings and the wider public. 

How will they benefit from this research? 
Researchers: Findings will benefit these users in the short to medium term, by (i) bearing on the advancement of basic science in the area of biological psychiatry and epigenetics, (ii) shedding light into dynamic changes in DNAm across childhood, (iii) increasing understanding of how environmental and epigenetic factors interrelate over time to affect developmental outcomes, such as CP, (iv) identifying common vs distinct biological markers underpinning comorbid symptoms, and (v) illustrating the application of innovative, cross-disciplinary methodologies to the study of longitudinal epigenetic data. As previously stated, pathways to impact within this group will primarily involve publication of papers and conference presentations. 

Professionals working with CP youth: Although immediate practical applications are unlikely, professionals working with CP youth may benefit from this research in the medium to long term. In the first instance, research findings may inform a theoretical framework for practitioners to understand how adverse experiences 'get under the skin' to influence child outcomes. Findings may also identify important windows of opportunity for prevention, by tracing the timing of environmental and epigenetic effects on the development of CP and comorbid symptoms. On the longer term, epigenetic findings such as these may help lay the foundation for personalised treatment of CP youth. The potential clinical implications of the research will be communicated to professionals, particularly psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers working with CP youth, in the context of clinical conferences. I also plan to draw on my collaborative network to identify potential clinical outlets. For example, my PhD supervisors (Profs Viding and McCrory) have a continued track record of this type of involvement.

Policy makers: As a postdoctoral researcher, I have been an active participant in forums that consider the applications of basic science findings, for example by participating in special interest parliamentary group seminars and workshops. Meetings such as these represent an ideal opportunity to disseminate findings to parliamentary members who are interested in translating scientific findings to inform policy. With regards to longer term outlets, findings from the proposed project may contribute towards an evidence base for mental health and social policies relevant to youth with CP and comorbid difficulties. 

Wider community: Genetic and epigenetic research on behaviour sometimes arouses concerns in the media and the general public. During the course of the project, I plan to utilise media channels to disseminate findings, clarify the use and implications of this type of research and raise awareness of the mechanisms by which environmental factors can influence child development. Furthermore, I plan to draw on my close collaboration with Kids Company as an additional outlet for knowledge exchange, for example by participating in their frequent public engagement initiatives. Kids Company is a charity that provides practical, emotional and educational support to vulnerable inner-city youth, and has shown a strong commitment to fostering open communication between researchers, professionals, the wider public and youth themselves concerning issues relevant to child development and behaviour.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250543</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Erasmus University Medical Center</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Epidemiology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Generation R, Netherlands</gtr:description><gtr:id>A8308ADD-16E7-479E-93E5-F3BAE63E8ACB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Currently working on two projects that will result in publications.

The project has three main objectives:
(i) to trace how exposure to early life stress influences the activity of genes from birth to late childhood via epigenetic changes; 
(ii) to establish whether these epigenetic changes play a role in the development of conduct problems in childhood and adolescence; and 
(iii) to examine whether these same changes also contribute to the development of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms.

The project is now into its second year, and significant findings are beginning to emerge that address all three of these objectives. 
Specifically, using longitudinal data from the ALSPAC birth cohort, we have found that:
(i) Exposure to risk factors during pregnancy, such as maternal smoking (Cecil et al., 2016), poor diet (Rijlaarsdam et al., 2016) and negative life events (Walton et al., 2017), is associated with epigenetic changes to the baby's DNA at birth, particularly among genes important for brain development and function. 
(ii) In turn, epigenetic patterns at birth (but not later in childhood) are associated with risk for conduct problems. For example, using hypothesis-free, genome-wide analyses we have found that DNA methylation levels in a number of genes important for pain sensitivity and neurotransmitter function differentiated children who go on to develop an early-onset vs low trajectory of conduct problems between the ages of 4 to 13 years (Cecil et al., under review). 
(iii) Similarly, we have found that epigenetic patterns at birth (but not later in childhood) also associate with risk for a range of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms during childhood and adolescence, including ADHD (Walton et al., 2016), substance use (Cecil et al., 2016) and brain-based vulnerability markers of psychopathology (e.g. amygdala:hippocampus volume ratio: Walton et al., 2017). 

Interestingly, we have also found that epigenetic patterns at birth not only associate with risk for psychiatric problems later in life, but also resilience. Specifically, we have recently published data showing that DNA methylation levels the Oxytocin Receptor Gene at birth (a gene implicated in social behaviours, such as empathy and bonding) predict resilient behaviour in children exposed to prenatal adversity. 

Overall, these findings provide preliminary support for a role of DNA methylation as a potential biological mechanism through which genes and environment combine to influence long-term development, mental health and behaviour.

In the coming year, as longitudinal epigenetic data becomes available, we will be testing whether similar findings emerge using a second, independent birth cohort (Generation R, Netherlands). In addition to replication, it will be important establish whether the observed associations between environmental risk, DNA methylation and psychiatric symptoms are truly causal, or simply correlational. For example, the use of advanced methodologies such as Mendelian Randomisation will considerably help in this respect. 

Bearing this in mind, there are a number of ways in which findings may be put to use by others. First, in an educational context, these findings may be used to increase awareness about the relevance of epigenetic mechanisms in health and development, as well as clarifying the use and potential implications of epigenetic research. This is a necessary first step in achieving impact, as current knowledge in this area has yet to permeate non-academic spheres in a substantive way. Second, if found to be replicable and robust, these research findings may be used to inform clinical practice. For example, the identification of vulnerable developmental periods (e.g. prenatal risks; epigenetic changes at birth) may enable us to pinpoint key windows of opportunity for intervention as well as informing the allocation of available resources. Finally, in the longer term, there is potential for these findings to improve the evidence-base for social policies and approaches targeted to reducing the mental health burden. Findings may also help to identify potential targets for the development of novel treatments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>47E9BE12-DF0D-4BE7-AF66-0B7A7FE4E5B2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c82cb0e3e366.26484205</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>03415447-31D6-4A8C-AED5-F52F6FE2638E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Callous-Unemotional Traits and Co-Occurring Anxiety: Developmental Validity of an Adolescent Taxonomy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d6e5dd73d21ff02637d8d1fba0c6d77"><gtr:id>7d6e5dd73d21ff02637d8d1fba0c6d77</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Meehan A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e2b39934d6.93251622</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F9FE5002-E449-4BF8-8EF1-6AD50E9C828C</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Methylome-Wide Association Study of Trajectories of Oppositional Defiant Behaviors and Biological Overlap With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Child development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6024011911a98a3b462f7c7bcb928392"><gtr:id>6024011911a98a3b462f7c7bcb928392</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barker ED</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0009-3920</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fca93aa27a1.18102338</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>366E8EE6-2AAF-41FD-829D-E6C26CAF7410</gtr:id><gtr:title>Longitudinal epigenetic predictors of amygdala:hippocampus volume ratio</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Child Psychology &amp;
