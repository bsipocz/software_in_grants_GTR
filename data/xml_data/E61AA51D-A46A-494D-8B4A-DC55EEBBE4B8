Their use will contribute to the targets in place for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the weight of components and therefore energy used. They comprise a reinforcement embedded in a matrix material which may be made up from many combinations of materials. An example of an everyday composite material which is found everywhere is reinforced concrete. In the field of polymer composites the materials are typically either a glass or carbon fibre reinforcement in a polymer matrix. In many cases the reinforcements are produced in the form of textiles which gives ease of handling but also, in the case of more complex 3D weaves, gives the opportunity to enhance the properties of the material and to design specific shapes. In order to optimise the design of these woven materials computer simulations are carried out which enable the prediction of their material properties, for example how strong or stiff they are, and also how they will behave during manufacture, for example how the liquid resin will flow through the textile when creating a complex shaped part. TexGen is open-source software, developed at the University of Nottingham for the creation of 3D geometric models of textiles used in these simulations and will form the basis for the software developed during this research programme.

During the course of this Fellowship a new major version of TexGen will be developed which will meet the modelling requirements of the increasingly complex textiles and preforms used in composite materials and of new textile structures as they emerge. A tool will be developed for optimisation of the weave patterns used to form preform structures such as I- and T-beams, common elements used in engineering design.

Textiles are used in a large range of applications and industries from clothing to the rollers on paper making machines. New 'intelligent' textiles are being developed which incorporate different materials or sensors and are being applied to fields such as health care and sportswear. This programme will identify new and emerging areas in textile technology which will have requirements for modelling and simulation capability. The requirements will vary with the materials, for example transport of heat, fluid, electrons and molecules through the textile. A new set of tools will be developed to meet the analysis needs of these new technologies, enabling simulations relevant to the different materials to be performed and impacting on both the properties created and manufacturing processes developed for these new materials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The composites industry contributes to the UK economy across multiple sectors - aerospace and defence, transportation, construction, marine, energy and wind energy. Reduction in development time and cost using validated simulation and modelling tools has been identified as one of the areas required for delivering growth across these sectors. TexGen software will enable the modelling of textile composites to be delivered, used by composites textile manufacturers such as Sigmatex and Formax and end users across the industry, both in the UK and internationally, such as Rolls-Royce and VolksWagen.

Targets are in place for reduction in carbon emissions by 2020. The use of composite materials will be a major contributor to the achievement of these targets. For example, an environmental impact assessment has shown that by 2050 composite aeroplanes could reduce emissions from the global fleet by 14-15%. There are also renewable energy targets which will be met, in part, by wind energy which again uses composite materials. In many cases these composite materials use reinforcements in the form of textiles. Optimisation of these textiles and the composites made from them will result in lighter, stronger materials whose use will lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Software such as TexGen will form a fundamental part in the development of these optimisation tools, the development of one such tool for optimising stiffener preforms of the type used in aircraft being a part of this proposal. This optimisation capability will facilitate a 'virtual testing' environment which will both reduce the design time and reduce the physical wastage of materials during the design and development process. Optimisation of composite components will also result in lower cost products, using fewer raw materials. This will have financial benefits for both the producer and the end users.

Textiles are used across a wide range of industries with new textiles and applications constantly emerging. New markets will stem from the development of these new materials leading to new industrial development and job creation. The initial development of these new textile materials will depend on new modelling capability and the existing textile modelling features within TexGen will give an ideal starting point for developing this. Once established, these new sectors will require the modelling tools for product optimisation and design.

The two proposed community engagement activities aim to address the declining numbers entering computing careers in the UK and therefore have impact on the future of the computing industry in the country. The Lovelace Colloquium addresses the issue of the 'leaky pipeline' whereby women leave the computing professions as they progress through their education and career. It aims to encourage women who have already begun Computer Science degrees to stay in the industry when they graduate. The second activity is the App Inventor Family Fun Days which are aimed at engaging children and young people in computing activities such that they consider pursuing computing as a career option.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>384850</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FE65B104-90B0-4E86-8C9F-46B33C3A8907</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Colloquium for undergraduate and taught postgraduate students, 180 students attending in 2016, with the aim of encouraging retention of women in the computing sector.
