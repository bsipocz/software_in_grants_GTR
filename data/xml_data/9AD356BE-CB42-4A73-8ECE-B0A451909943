It took the form of simply discussion, with people from each perspective presenting their ideas on how the NIP can be improved. I think my perspective was shared by several others, that major change was desirable in the way the Plan was tackled. Similar ideas emerged subequently in the Labour Partly Armitt Review of 2013-2014, with which I have also interacted.

Continued communication with the organiser, and also some useful contacts established, including in the Treasury.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464a346303689.18019679</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Both during the period of the fellowship and in the nearly four years since the end of the grant period, I have been involved in dissemination of the research results in numerous forms. This has been both nationally within the UK, and internationally. 

This has resulted in impact in policy circles, in addition to that within academia itself. Such academic impact can in both short and long runs feed through to new research or influence public agendas in ways that are far from easily demonstrated.
One typical example internationally would be meeting with a researcher from the New Zealand Council for Infrastructure Development in late 2014, at at time when the Council was studying best practice on infrastructure policy in selected European countries (almost exactly matching my case study states). The researcher was able to gain a great deal from the book which came out of the research as well as the set of other publications now completed. Another case would be the seminar in Germany to take place in early 2015 on Power Grids, when I am joining other international experts on this theme to discuss the multiple challenges of installing new electricity grids, particularly the planning dimensions - the meeting is sponsored by the professional - academic German planning academy (ARL).

Within the UK, I have made numerous presentations on the results in differing forums, such as those to WEET (Westminster Energy, Environment and Transport) seminars attended by governmental and policy network audiences, to the Institute for Government and other think tanks or policy development bodies, as well as to mixed academia / practice forums such as the Infrastructure conferences held at University College over the last three years and at consultancy / industry events. These have fed into the continuous discussions on the changing and fine tuning of the current infrastructure planning regime. I have also been attempting to challenge some of the underlying biases of that regime, by showing alternative approaches, for example in Scotland, France and the Netherlands. Securing deep impact in that respect is hard, as it goes against the ingrained mind sets and most current hegemonic ideas, which rarely allow a place for long term and widely deliberated approaches to infrastructure planning. However I believe my writing as well as my presence at numerous events of this kind (also in international academic conferences) have at least presented different perspectives in this wider sense.

Early but much fuller evidence on these issues was provided in the Impact Report to ESRC in late 2011. Other evidence can be accessed, via the author, in the form of an expanded CV in early 2014.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>56FFC189-472F-493B-94C3-C35737F9C1E6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463aa56cf9382.62158946</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project developed knowledge and theorisation of the way in which infrastructure planning and spatial planning relate to each other, by means of research on the UK and Western Europe. The field is caught in strong tensions generated by potentially clashing goals. Countries are addressing the challenges in varying ways, despite some common trends. Varied national approaches are generating valuable experience, which is now starting to affect EU policy - though it is not yet clear whether in a productive way, given problematic features of EU governance.

All of the aspects below are picked up in much greater detail in the book and articles.

Some headline empirical findings
Infrastructure provision is an achilles heel for many countries, with framing circumstances making achievement of multiple objectives (economic, low carbon, social) ever more difficult to achieve.
Planning, whilst significant, is rarely the key issue that it is presented as being in some countries - especially the UK - and by some interests.
Some countries make less heavy weather of planning major infrastructure than others, by using sophisticated planning approaches in a more agile way. Such approaches can integrate planning spatially and therefore across infrastructure sectors. 
Both high level spatial planning (Netherlands, Scotland) and generously resourced project stage deliberation (France) show their worth. This contrasts with the approach in England, where the stress is on project decision speeding up, with silo-style departmental policy making.
However UK practice has been innovative in the last decade, in England and Scotland. Further evolution of the current UK regimes is to be expected, given the perceived importance of changing large scale infrastructure systems, especially for energy and transport. 

Some theoretical implications
The dominant picture from the research is of a field of serious tensions and conflicts. This is evident in the history of the reform process in the UK, and in the account of contemporary national level planning. These reforms, embedded in conflictual processes and policy development in each European state in different ways, must be related to the primary features of recent history, including the building of neoliberalising states, and the contesting powers of business interests and social pressures. The research therefore contributes to the wider work in planning, geography and political science in understanding the nature of state policy. Infrastructure policy as a whole, as well as its spatialised component, has been a critically important feature of state policy across all polities studied. This applies as much to England and Scotland, where highly contrasting reform drives characterise the years since 2006, as to the Netherlands, France or Spain, where policies on (main)ports, water and rail lines have all been at the centre of controversies and high level politics during the 2000s, as well as to the EU.

The explanation advanced by the project is not one of &amp;quot;pure neoliberalisation&amp;quot;, that is of a single theoretical strand. The research has shown the necessity to consider major sectoral and subsectoral distinctions, and set these within fully understood geographical and historical realities. The spatial shapes and insertions of infrastructure condition what is planned and plannable, in relation to macro strategies (national and regional, potentially continental), and for each major project. Whilst the research focussed much less on the project level (which has been fully investigated in some respects in parallel work in the last five years), the interplay of strategic, sectoral and project level decision making and implementation is seen to be critical. In the infrastructure planning field the mix of complex time and scalar dynamics is the norm, all tied up in many cases with high politicisation.

The planning component of state management has to be seen within the whole structure of provision, embracing the power of major private corporations and the regulatory roles of states. Spatial planning matters, as a difficult and annoying reality which elites must deal with, but only within this broader power system. Setting planning understandings within this broader grasp is a core output from the research, relevant more widely to planning theory, and contributing, it is hoped, to debates on the scope for and limits to democratic steering of major societal change and transitions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main research findings have now been fully out in the public domain for more than 2 years, in the form of the main book publication, although further publications developed particular aspects of the research, appearing in early 2014. I am aware that other academics both in the UK and elsewhere use the results and are looking to launch new research starting from the base set in this project, particularly in tracking the development of the 2008 UK Planning Act regime, There is beginning now to be a solid set of researchable outputs from this regime, so that the claims made for the regime, and the positive and negative aspects noted by different actors, can now be tested in a way that has not been possible up to now. 

One part of such a follow up programme has been some work which I have carried out with Richard Cowell of Cardiff University, on the temporal dimensions of infrastructure planning decisions. There are many other dimensions which would benefit from much fuller empirical research, and, as implied in the section on key findings, this can be a significant input to major current themes in the social sciences. Examples would include state scalar change (for example change at EU level in this field, as against national state regulation), the implications for the debates around (de)politicisation, or the scope for forms of political deliberation beyond standard electoral or expert forums.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0AB38B41-A08F-47B0-B80D-ABCF8FDE9754</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463ac71d75877.12598821</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://planning.brookes.ac.uk/research/spg/projects/infrastructure/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>896FCDF8-C0BB-4AAD-BE50-66F8E11E985A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Not yet set in stone</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Town and country planning</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3c12dd9e71b34c8efc661512425cc9aa"><gtr:id>3c12dd9e71b34c8efc661512425cc9aa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tim Marshall (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_2810179217cb33c7d8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1DB3CA5B-685D-48F6-8053-965925E152B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Infrastructure and spatial planning : Spain working paper</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/441e57e10ebdf19016c414e74dc5e04e"><gtr:id>441e57e10ebdf19016c414e74dc5e04e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mihir A.
