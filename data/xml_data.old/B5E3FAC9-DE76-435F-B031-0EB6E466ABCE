The project will explore questions regarding the role of different actors in developing businesses in cultural districts while preserving and disseminating their cultural heritage. Hence, the research is positioned in a wider debate regarding the links between cultural preservation, urban regeneration and tourism.

The selected site is George Town, a post-British colonial town in Malaysian. The town has experienced gentrification since 1997 after the repeal of Rent Control Act. The pace gentrification exacerbated with the growth of tourism and influx of external capital investment after its have been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. Gentrification induces displacement of long-term residents and causes erosion of local culture and heritage - a global phenomenon in many World Heritage Sites.

Nonetheless, a creative and cultural value chain has been developed with involvement of various local and external actors. The development of cultural district is becoming an important tool for urban planning in fostering the development of urban centres and revitalising neighbourhoods in decline. Reviewing the existing models of innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem, there is a gap in the scope of these models in capturing civil society actors and insufficiently explaining the phenomena of cultural clusters. Thereby, they are inadequate in informing urban planning policy makers, the innovation community, cultural organisations and small businesses.

The main objectives of this project are:
1) To develop a relational model of innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem for creative and cultural districts
2) To provide social network insights for the development of creative economy and conservation of cultural heritage in George Town
3) To produce a policy brief on strategies for developing creative and cultural districts in George Town 

This research intends to deploy a novel approach using Social Network Analysis to identify actors and their networks. Understanding these networks and roles will enable the conceptual development of a novel relational model of entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem, specifically for cultural districts.

This research will collect, via face-to-face administrated questionnaires, approx. 1000 network relations of actors in the creative and cultural value chain in George Town. We will use UCINET to analyse and map this network and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Based on these findings, we will conduct six in-depth case studies of core actors in the networks to gain rich qualitative insights on how they build innovative and entrepreneurial networks. This method is a novel approach to develop and conceptualise a model of innovation and entrepreneurship for creative and cultural district. The model is applicable more generally to other small towns and cities, particularly world heritage sites, where there is a potential to build a creative and cultural district empowering local residents with opportunities.

For greater impact, we plan to produce a policy brief on cultural districts for George Town. This brief will be built on the findings of the Social Network Analysis and a review of existing policies in the UK and Penang. We will organise a study visit for Malaysian delegates to creative districts in London, NESTA, and the Department of Culture.

The researchers are multi-disciplinary experts from the UK and Malaysia. Two project partners based in Penang are invited to contribute to the research process as well as take the findings forward in policy-making process and in innovation and entrepreneurial activities among the local community. We will organise knowledge sharing and transfer workshops for local researchers. There will be a feedback and dissemination workshop targeting local policy makers, NGOs, and local creative businesses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) National and city level policy research institutions and policy makers 
One of the aims of this research is to analyse and compare existing cultural districts policies in the UK and Penang. A policy brief on cultural districts will be produced by consulting the success stories of the UK's &amp;pound;84 billion (in 2014) creative industry. The brief will offer some insights of the results of this research, particularly on the development of suitable collaboration strategies for cultural districts. It will also draw from the novel conceptual model of innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem for cultural sector developed by this research

Our project partners could then take it forward to the next stages of policy formulation and implementation for cultural districts in George Town. The partners are established and influential quasi-governmental think tanks in Penang. The research results will be communicated to them through regular meetings with their researchers. We will be inviting 4 representatives from project partners and other local organisations to a data analysis and interpretation workshop in London. In conjunction with this workshop, we also plan a 2-day visit in London to cultural districts, Nesta, and Department of Culture.

In Year 2, a workshop is planned in Penang to receive feedback from the policy circle and beyond to create awareness and disseminate results. 

2) Local traditional civil society groups and businesses along the cultural value chain
One of the key outputs of this project is to provide social network insights for the development of creative economy and conservation of cultural heritage. The results are e.g. social network maps of cultural and creative industry showing the strengths and weaknesses of relationships and ties among various actors. In addition to feeding into policy formulation, they will also enable creative businesses and organisations to alter their network strategies. The development of the novel ecosystem model of innovation nd entrepreneurship will help to inform local organisations and businesses to identify new gaps and opportunities

The results will be communicated to the end users. The preliminary social network results will be shown to selected participants for verification as well as achieving the objective of dissemination. We plan a workshop at the end of data analysis so that we can receive feedback and further disseminate findings to the stakeholders

3) Local residents, organisations and individuals in cultural conservation sector
Local residents are often under the threat of displacement due to gentrification in world heritage sites. With the development of cultural districts and expansion of local economy, local residents have more opportunities to start their businesses and avoid the fate of displacement. 

By identifying the strengths and weaknesses in the George Town innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem, the residents and local NGOs can then take on the role to build a healthy ecosystem that enables them to be entrepreneurial and innovative while conserving their culture. This information would be presented in the final workshop in Penang to these groups of beneficiaries. Our project partners would also work with them to bring the ideas forward for implementation.

4) International level policy makers and other stakeholders in heritage conservation and tourism development 
The social impact of the project would be significant, particularly in the understanding of developing cultural districts within World Heritage sites across the world. The model of cultural innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem can be replicated globally.

To reach these target recipients, we would publish in academic and practitioner journals, and present in a practitioner conference. Our internal and external advisory board members have connections and can assist in bringing the findings to the attention of UNESCO World Heritage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>103573</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P010377/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8990E5FE-B44F-4A5B-8FDE-0610A5BE98C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D6F08770-CB96-423D-89E7-3F64DE17997E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Innovation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E55D12BF-71BF-4AFE-9E66-5A6E2920965F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Strategic Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
