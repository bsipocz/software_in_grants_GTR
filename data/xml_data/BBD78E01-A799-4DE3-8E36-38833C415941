Cultural Memory</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K005324/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Speaking directly to the grant scheme's theme on 'inter-generational communication, cultural transmission, and exchange', this exploratory research project seeks to critically examine the ways the First World War is taught via History and English Literature across secondary schools and universities in England. The ultimate aim of the project is to deepen our understanding of the link between education and the formation of contemporary memories of the war in the English context. It is about examining the war in its articulation in the present, to allow us to be in a position to make recommendations for the future. This cannot be achieved, however, until we find out what is actually happening in classrooms across England. 

There exists, in England, a specific national perception of the First World War. A tragic disaster, fought mainly in the muddied, rat-filled and lice-ridden trenches of the Western Front, by young, innocent 'Tommies', led by imbecile Generals who willfully sacrificed their men for a cause that would, with the outbreak of the Second World War, be proven to be utterly pointless. Overall, there is a general awareness that the war was a uniquely terrible experience. Where has this view come from? 

Popular cultural outputs such as Blackadder Goes Forth, Downton Abbey, Birdsong, Regeneration, and War Horse - to name a selection - reiterate and consolidate the above view. Academic commentators such as Stephen Badsey, Ian Beckett, Brian Bond, and Gary Sheffield argue that these programmes, novels, plays and films are popular because they echo the image of the war that has been taught in secondary level History and English Literature classes across the UK. 

However, until now, no serious study has been undertaken into the way the First World War is taught via the subjects of History and English Literature. Until this is rectified, and in a context that allows dialogue and interaction between academics and secondary school teachers, we cannot make assertions about the links between education and the way the war is understood in the 21st century. 

With its series of centenaries approaching, the First World War is likely to be of increased interest to teachers in secondary and tertiary education. It is therefore an opportune moment to begin research into the way the war is taught in schools and its role in the creation of a cultural memory of the war. If secondary education does contribute to a narrow and Anglo-centric understanding of the war - and is at a mismatch with some of the latest scholarship taught at university level - the centenary period provides a ripe opportunity for investigating capacity for change and making suggestions that consider the expertise, requirements and aims of teachers at secondary and tertiary level on equal terms. 

This exploratory project seeks to listen to teachers and academics about their experiences, needs and challenges in teaching the First World War in two stages. Firstly, in the half-term break of February 2013, a symposium will be hosted in London where teachers and academics will come together to discuss and compare the ways the First World War is taught via the subjects of History and English Literature. The aim is to create a positive and fruitful atmosphere to discuss ways of achieving greater continuity between the learning experiences of students who study the First World War at school and university, with lasting outcomes such as an interactive website to allow for teacher-academic dialogue into the future. Stage two will take the form of a questionnaire circulated in a two-tier methodology, online and in face-to-face interviews with focus groups made up of teachers and academics across the country. These two research stages will form the basis of a comprehensive report into the teaching practices in secondary schools and Higher Education and two peer-reviewed journal articles relating to cultural transmission of the First World War through education.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Direct beneficiaries:
a. Teaching professionals in the secondary and tertiary sectors engaged in teaching First World War history or literature/film.
b. Educational policy makers and exam boards.
c. Professional organisations developing programmes of CPD.

Indirect beneficiaries:
d. Students in secondary and tertiary education studying the First World War.
e. Museums with First World War-related exhibits, such as the Imperial War Museum, and including digital collections, such as the University of Oxford's Great War Archive.

Economic and societal impact:
1. Contributes towards evidence based policy-making and influences educational policies at a local, regional and national level with regard to First World War teaching.
2. Contributes to increasing public awareness and understanding of social issues surrounding the remembrance and public awareness of the First World War and its legacy.
3. Transforms evidence based policy in educational practice and influences and informs teaching practitioners and professional practice with regard to First World War teaching.

The benefits of our research are by no means limited to an academic audience. The project relies on close collaboration with secondary school teaching professionals, exam board representatives and professional organisations (English Association, Historical Association), and these groups will benefit directly from the research outcomes. Through the initial symposium and regional focus group meetings, teachers and exam board representatives will have the chance to engage with the project, review and discuss results of the survey, and recommend changes to teaching policy and practice on the basis of our findings. We hope that this will contribute to a more balanced, inclusive teaching practise with regard to the First World War through exploring questions about the on-going development of the war's cultural memory through the impact of teaching. Our close collaboration with the English Association means that our findings will almost immediately inform a programme of Continued Professional Development for teachers of English developed by the EA for delivery in 2013 and 2014. Our project also coincides with a period of change in the education system, with a move from GCSEs to the new EBacc qualification proposed for 2015 (and latest proposals surrounding the replacement of A Levels with the ABacc). As this process will necessitate fundamental changes to the curriculum, the syllabi set by individual exam boards and teaching materials available, our research is excellently placed to impact upon revisions of how the First World War is taught across the subjects of History and English Literature at a national level, facilitated by our PI's position on Edexcel's History Strategic Advisory Board 2012-13.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24010</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Historical Association</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with the EA, HA and IoE</gtr:description><gtr:id>882E25B2-98CD-403A-BB02-EEB8ECE08D61</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Catriona Pennell, 'On the Frontlines of Teaching the History of the First World War' in Teaching History [Historical Association] (TH 155), pp. 34-40.

In addition, the findings of our survey have been integrated into the government-funded Battlefield Centenary Tours Programme in collaboration with the Institute of Education. 

Teachers and other educators are able to revise existing teaching resources and methods (and develop new ones) based on our research findings. Museum education outreach officers have also highlighted that our findings are very useful to them in planning activities with schools and visiting groups. Contacts in exam boards have also indicated that our report is very useful to them when revising specifications in the light of GCSE and A-Level reform.

Our findings have also been used to challenge existing ideas about the way the First World War is taught and, in particular, that teachers are doing a poor job. A good example of this was in January 2014 when Michael Gove (then Secretary of State for Education) suggested the Blackadder was being used as a teaching aid in schools to highlight the futility of the war. We were able to make public statements in the Guardian and TES as well as BBC News to counter such misguided perceptions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9C5D464D-E3CD-47F1-ACDB-65FF02584278</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5452486e0661c4.32522071</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research project has enabled us to examine - at a crucial moment in First World War commemoration - how the topic is taught and why by secondary school teachers of History and English Literature in England. This has allowed us to draw conclusions on the relationship between education (in its broadest sense) and the formation of cultural memory about the war. We are now in a position to make recommendations to teachers and other educators, as well as education policy makers and exam boards regarding best practice and ways to develop the teaching of the subject. 

The project's Final Report was published, online (via the project website) in early June 2014. It is therefore freely available to anyone interested in the project's results. At just over 100 pages long, its findings are complex and nuanced. However, highlights include:
o The First World War remains a key topic for History and English Literature teachers and will continue to remain as part of the curriculum despite ongoing reforms to GCSE and A-level, although its presence in English Literature classrooms will continue to depend largely on school policy and/or teachers' individual preferences. 
o Misperceptions exist amongst politicians and other commentators, and in the media, about the way the subject is taught. Our findings have highlighted the innovative and complex ways many teachers engage their students with the topic often in tandem with a variety of sources that seek to broaden understanding. 
o In terms of History, there is clearly a relationship between popular perceptions of the war in Britain and the default topics that are taught - notably the Western Front, trench warfare and the origins of the war. Until these topics are varied by exam boards in their specifications there will be little change in the classroom, especially at KS4 and above, when the emphasis is on exam attainment. There is more freedom to teach other aspects of the conflict at KS3. 
o For English teachers, teaching First World War literature poses a particular challenge in that it necessarily entails the teaching of cultural and historical context, and raises questions about subject remit. This point also on occasion causes friction between English teachers and their History colleagues. Important factors for choosing authors and texts to cover are availability and inclusion in exam board units on the one hand and appeal to students on the other.
o Problems surrounding the contextualisation of literary sources in English Literature lessons particularly highlights the need for more cross-curricular activities and coordination within schools. While cross-curricular approaches may often be hard to implement as part of regular teaching, our survey and focus groups flagged several examples of best practice where schools had utilised project days or weeks and/or battlefield trips to engage in cross-curricular work on the First World War. The report identified a number of practical variables that impact on the way the First World War is taught. These prominently include time constraints, budget, type of school, type of teacher, geographical location, and pupil intake (i.e. pupils' social and ethnic background).
o Teachers do not necessarily want more resources on the First World War. Rather they want guidance on the best ones to use, and mechanisms to filter the overwhelming array of resources available to them already. Bite-size accessible pieces of academic research could facilitate such filtering by putting teachers in touch with the current state of research on the subject. 
o There is further a clear need for linking up academics and teachers, especially in terms of providing high-quality, free Continued Professional Development (CPD), to help allow the latest research to penetrate into secondary-school classrooms.
o English and History teachers alike recognise the potential moral dimension in teaching about the First World War, and frequently use teaching about the war as an opportunity to build pupils' capacity for empathy. For History teaching, in particular, this raises the question of approaching the war as an historical and/or emotional event, particularly in the light of the emphasis placed on battlefield cemetery visits both by individual teachers, schools and the government (in its centenary funding).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are already in the process of expanding this project to compare our findings with other regional, national and international case-studies.
