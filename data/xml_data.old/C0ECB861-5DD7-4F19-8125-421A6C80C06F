Since then, it has grown to a theory with applications to many areas of mathematics, including combinatorics, geometry, and representation theory. Classic homological algebra is often phrased as the theory of abelian and triangulated categories.

Higher dimensional homological algebra is a new development of the last decade. It is the theory of n-abelian categories and (n+2)-angulated categories, where n is a positive integer. In these categories, the role previously played by 1-extensions is taken over by n-extensions. Note that the case n=1 gives ordinary abelian and triangulated categories, hence classic homological algebra. We refer to (n+2)-angulated categories because the case n=1 gives triangulated categories. Higher dimensional homological algebra is currently very active. It has applications to algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. There are substantial contributions from a number of strong mathematicians (Iyama, Keller, Reiten). Some of the combinatorial structures which appear, like higher dimensional cyclic polytopes, are novel to homological algebra and representation theory.

This project will provide three key items currently missing in higher dimensional homological algebra: Tilting objects, higher dimensional derived categories, and higher dimensional model categories. We will define tilting objects in higher dimensional homological algebra and show a version of the Ingalls-Thomas bijections between support tilting objects, torsion classes, intermediate t-structures, and non-crossing partitions. This will enhance and illuminate the links to combinatorics. We will define higher dimensional derived categories and higher dimensional model categories. This will provide the right context for higher dimensional tilting theory, and give a comprehensive framework for higher dimensional homological algebra.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project falls firmly within the subject of pure mathematics, in the general area of algebra. It will provide some key items currently missing in higher dimensional homological algebra: Tilting objects, higher dimensional derived categories, and higher dimensional model categories.

In terms of knowledge impact, the development of key methods of tilting theory and derived and model categories will be useful to the further development of higher dimensional homological algebra, as witnessed by the importance of these techniques to classic homological algebra.

In terms of people impact, it will be a major impact of the project that the Principal Investigator will train two skilled researchers (the Research Assistant and the PhD student) significantly in a very active field of research, thereby contributing directly to the people pipeline in mathematics. The new skills acquired by the Research Assistant and the PhD student have potential uses inside, as well as outside academia. If they continue to academic employment, then their skills will have a wider academic impact. If they aim for other types of jobs, then their strengthened mathematical background will be an economic asset to society, as witnessed by the good employability of mathematicians in highly skilled jobs with outstanding value-adding potential.

In terms of society impact, the route from discovery to application is very long in pure mathematics. For instance, mobile phones rely crucially on methods which were developed over more than 200 years of pure mathematics. Modern mobile phones could not work without strong error correcting codes, since errors are unavoidable in the wireless transmission of large amounts of data. Error correcting codes are formalised and studied in the mathematical subject of coding theory. Coding theory builds, to a significant extent, on linear algebra over finite fields. Linear algebra itself was founded by Hermann Grassmann in his book &amp;quot;Die Lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik&amp;quot; in 1844. Linear algebra over finite fields relies on modular arithmetic which was founded by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &amp;quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&amp;quot; in 1801. At the time of their publication, both books were purely academic works, and the practical application to mobile phones could not have been predicted. However, both were highly celebrated academic publications, and they are not the only examples of such which have later had a strong societal impact. Other instances include the use of differential geometry for GPS systems, and the use of the algebraic geometry of elliptic curves for cryptography. It is hence crucial for future societal prospects to maximise the academic impact of the project. We explained in the section on Academic Beneficiaries how we plan to use conference talks and publications in general mathematics journals to accomplish this.

In terms of economic impact, it will have a positive economic impact to train two skilled researchers, who may well choose to stay in Britain after the conclusion of the project. It will have a positive economic impact on the North East of England to recruit two researchers to Newcastle, and to employ them for three years. The recruitment and training of two researchers will help to raise the international profile of Newcastle University and of British academia as a whole, potentially increasing their already substantial contribution to wealth creation in the British economy. The economic impact of the scientific outcomes of the project cannot be predicted. As explained, the route from discovery to application is very long in pure mathematics. However, in the long run, in order to maintain economic success, it is crucial for any country to support a strong scientific base with outstanding universities. In particular, this comprises a strong foundation in mathematical research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>241188</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P016014/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
