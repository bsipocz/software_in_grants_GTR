humans?</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/I012370/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The modern invention of processed foods has fundamentally changed our food environment. Retailers now stock an extremely wide range of foods. Even single types of food (e.g., pizza) are now available in numerous varieties that differ in size and the number of calories that they contain. For example, our data show that the number of calories in fish pie 'ready meals' can vary by up to 450% in the UK. In animals, this kind of 'variability' promotes overeating and an increase in body weight. For the first time, this project will explore whether this also happens in humans. There are two ways in which variability in our food environment might increase the number of calories that we consume. These are summarised below. In PHASE 1 we will look at our capacity to 'compensate' for calories in food. When we consume one meal shortly after another then good compensation occurs when the size of the first meal controls the size of the second meal (i.e., a larger first meal causes people to consume a smaller second meal). In animals, poor compensation has been linked to a degraded 'cephalic-phase response.' This anticipatory response governs appetite and represents a series of physiological changes (e.g., salivation and insulin release) that prepare the body for the consumption and digestion of food. Critically, merely looking at or smelling a food is sufficient to elicit a response that is proportional to the calories contained in a food. This shows that learning is involved and that responses are based on previous encounters with individual foods. In this phase we will determine whether the cephalic-phase response is reduced in highly variable foods and whether this promotes poor compensation leading to overconsumption. Cephalic-phase responses will be measured in a number of ways. In particular, we will develop a new method based on changes in skin temperature near to the liver. Previously, researchers have found that this 'thermogenic response' is particularly sensitive to different foods. In this interdisciplinary project we will work with an expert in sensor technology to develop this sensitivity still further. In PHASE 2 we will explore the idea that variability in our food environment makes it more difficult for us to predict the extent to which a particular food will stave off hunger. In 2002 a Nobel Prize was awarded for advances in the field of behavioural economics. This work shows that uncertainty tends to generate cautious and conservative responses and has been used extensively to predict animal behaviour and a range of decisions relating to gambling, financial trading, and risk taking. We find it surprising that 'prospect theory' has not been applied to understand dietary behaviour in humans. For the first time, we will draw on these principles to test the idea that our variable food environment causes uncertainty about the effects of consuming a food, which creates confusion and a concern that hunger might be experienced after it has been consumed. In response to this uncertainty we make conservative dietary decisions and select and then consume larger portions of food. In summary, this project will address important questions relating to variability in our dietary environment. Previously, this issue has been largely overlooked. Nevertheless, research in animals would suggest that variability has the potential to play an important role in promoting overeating and obesity. The beneficiaries of this project are wide ranging. For individual consumers, this might involve increased public awareness of the effects of variable foods. For children, guidelines and/or legislation might be introduced to limit exposure to highly variable foods. For obese individuals, interventions might be possible that re-train sensitivity to the calories contained in specific foods. As such, this work has considerable potential to impact a number of groups, including; health professionals, policy makers, educators, and the wider public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Over time, the orosensory properties of a food can serve as a cue (conditioned stimulus) that enables an individual to predict the caloric consequences of consuming a particular food. When these 'flavour-nutrient associations' are disrupted this promotes imprecise caloric regulation and weight gain in rats. In the UK, foods are now highly processed and their energy density is manipulated routinely. This increases exposure to inconsistent flavour-nutrient pairings. For the first time, this project will elucidate the effects of these inconsistent parings in humans. Specifically, it will explore two hypotheses. In Phase 1 we will test the hypothesis that inconsistent flavour-nutrient pairings disrupt learned cephalic-phase responses to food and that this compromises the ability to compensate for calories in food from meal to meal. As part of this research we will draw on expertise in 'sensing technology' to refine methods for measuring thermogenic responses to food. In Phase 2 we will test the hypothesis that inconsistent flavour-nutrient pairings have a direct effect on meal size, specifically, that they create 'uncertainty' (psychological) about the satiety that a food is expected to confer, and that this promotes the selection of larger meals. Despite its otherwise widespread application, this is the first time that 'prospect theory' will be used to make predictions about human dietary behaviour. In total, 11 studies will be conducted. Nine of these will be controlled laboratory experiments involving participants drawn from local staff and student populations. Four of these will use a 'preload' paradigm and two will establish causality by manipulating flavour-nutrient consistency directly. Two online studies will be conducted using custom software, written in Java script. This research will identify specific ways in which our modern food environment promotes obesity in the UK. As such, it will impact academics, the food industry, and the general public.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In response to the question 'Who are the beneficiaries of this research?' we have inserted five subheadings below. Under each subheading we have added text that identifies 'How will user groups benefit from this research?' 1. FOOD COMPANIES Multi-national food companies have long recognised that a competitive advantage can be gained by developing foods that confer health benefits. In particular, several companies (e.g., Unilever and Nestl&amp;eacute;) develop and produce products that are specifically designed to aid weight loss by promoting satiety. This project will be of considerable benefit to these users because it will offer a methodology to evaluate their variability and the extent to which this impacts on the satiety that they confer. To this end, our measure of the thermogenic response has the potential to offer a highly informative, sensitive, and non-invasive assessment of the cephalic-phase response. To the applicants' knowledge, in the context of food variability, this has not been considered previously, in either an academic or an industry context. 2. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS/CLINICIANS If we are successful in establishing a relationship between food variability and overconsumption then this will offer an opportunity for health professionals and clinicians to develop appropriate intervention techniques that retrain sensitivity to the caloric content of foods in obese individuals. 3. POLICY MAKERS Research of this kind will assist policy makers because it has the potential to reveal a hitherto unknown relationship between our food environment and energy intake. In particular, this research will help to inform guidelines around healthy eating in adults. In children, it might also generate debate relating to whether children should be exposed to a variable food environment during their formative years. 4. NHS AND SOCIAL SERVICES The cost of obesity to the NHS and social services is considerable and it is expected to rise well above inflation ver the next few decades. Not all countries have the same problem, and this is the case even after controlling for GDP. Therefore, it is important to carry out basic research that identifies ways in which specific aspects of our food environment contribute to overconsumption. If this can be achieved then changes to our food environment may be possible, offering an opportunity to implement cheap and effective solutions that reduce the burden of obesity on the NHS and related social services. 5. WIDER PUBLIC In addition to the above, the wider public will benefit from an opportunity to take individual and more informed control of the foods that they consume and the foods that they give their children.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>416657</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Modelling Animal Decisions (MAD) group</gtr:department><gtr:description>Modelling the effects of dietary complexity on body weight and adiposity</gtr:description><gtr:id>3AEBFDAB-7501-463A-87C6-F6886D81421B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Various empirical studies using rodents implicate flavour-nutrient inconsistency as something that is detrimental - inconsistency causes animals to gain weight and to lack an ability to 'compensate' for calories. Intuitively, this makes sense. The prevailing view is that flavour-nutrient (F-N) learning is an important component of dietary control. Therefore, disrupting this ability should have 'negative' consequences. For the first time, this multi-disciplinary collaboration (between Experimental Psychologists and Theoretical Biologists) tested the logic behind this hypothesis. Our modelling has shown that F-N inconsistency only generates an increase in energy reserves if particular assumptions are held. When other assumptions are made, energy reserves actually decrease. These various outcomes are interesting, because they generate a set of grounded and novel hypotheses about F-N inconsistency and the effect this has on food intake and bodyweight. We are currently preparing a manuscript for submission to the International Journal of Obesity later this year based on these findings. The findings from this collaboration will be presented to the University of Bristol 'Decision-making Research' group on the 20th November 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54621702a573b0.36413252-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Professor Alasdair Houston and Dr Andrew Higginson used their extensive expertise in state-dependent dynamic programming models to program and run a model exploring the effects of; i) increases in energy density and ii) uncertainty about energy density on adiposity and body weight.

In the demo, we presented various portion sizes of a snack food (wine gums). The wine gums were presented in different portion sizes on 9 plates, ranging from 2g (one wine gum) up to 386g (a full plate of wine gums). Children had the option to try a wine gum to eat. As a visual feedback, we displayed bar charts where children could place a sticker underneath a portion size which corresponds to their ideal portion as well as their maximum portion.

As many of our computerised tasks involve portion size selection, we felt that this educational activity paired well with the research task and helped to illustrate the difference between &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; portions and &amp;quot;maximum&amp;quot; portions. The researchers then used conversation cues for child/family groups, while being careful to avoid any assertive message about eating. These cues were implemented to generate a discussion with the family. Further, any questions that parents or children had about the research tasks, such as explaining the more scientific concepts of our measures (i.e. expected satiety), were answered by the research staff on site. 

Example cues:
'How do you know when you're full?' This cue lead to conversations about physical and mental sensations of fullness and hunger.
'What do you think happens to food once it's inside your body?' This cue lead to conversations about your body using food to give you energy to do move/play, to allow you to grow, to help your body to recover if you're ill or hurt yourself.
&amp;quot;What is the most you could possibly eat?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;What is your perfect amount to eat&amp;quot;

The overall feedback from both parents and children who took part in the activity was extremely positive. Many parents commented that they hadn't ever considered several of the topics that we discussed with their child (such as portion tolerance) and they were interested to learn more.

Retailers now stock an extremely wide range of foods. Even single types of food (e.g., pizza) are now available in numerous varieties that differ in size and the number of calories that they contain. In animals, this kind of 'variability' promotes overeating and weight gain. This project represents the first systematic translation of these findings to the study of obesity in humans. 

Our research indicates that exposure to a wide variety of the same kind of food (e.g., pizza) promotes uncertainty about the energy content and expected satiation of that type of food. Specifically, we've shown that people tend to underestimate the expected satiation a food that they are uncertain about. For instance, we found that participants who had consumed a wide variety of pizzas (of various portion sizes and energy densities) believed that a portion of pizza would be less satiating compared to participants who had consumed fewer pizzas. Importantly, these expectations translated to real-life differences in food intake-when fed a portion of pizza and then given access to a second snack, the participants who had been exposed to a wide variety of pizzas ate more than the participants who had been exposed to fewer pizzas (Hardman et al., in prep). These findings suggest that dietary complexity reduces satiation and increases food intake, thereby contributing to weight gain.

Our research indicates that highly variable foods may also contribute to weight gain by reducing energy expenditure. One of the advantages of being able to accurately predict the energy content of food is that our body can generate anticipatory physiological responses which increase the efficiency of nutrient absorption. One of these 'cephalic phase responses' is thermogenesis-the increase in body heat which occurs before and during food intake. This increase in body temperature indicates an increase in energy expenditure; thus, decreases in cephalic phase thermogenesis could contribute to small but meaningful increases in body weight over time. Using a novel technique we developed for measuring thermogenesis in humans, we showed that cephalic phase responses were weaker in people who had highly variable dietary experiences compared to people with more limited and consistent dietary experience (Griggs et al., 2013; Coffey et al, 2013; Griggs et al., in prep.). This is the first demonstration that dietary complexity disrupts cephalic phase responses in humans, and identifies a second mechanism by which the current food environment might be contributing to obesity.

Food variety is not the only source of uncertainty in today's environment- uncertainty regarding when and how much one plans to eat at their next meal could also bias people to overeat. In order to determine whether these sources of uncertainty are also problematic for weight control, we conducted experiments in which we explored how the time until the next meal (i.e., the inter-meal interval) influenced how much food participants chose to consume during a lunchtime meal. We observed that participants elected to consume more food at lunch when the post-meal interval was longer than when it was shorter; however, uncertainty about the time of the next meal did not bias participants to overeat. This finding suggests that the uncertainty about the energy content of a meal may be more problematic for weight control than uncertainty about meal timing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research highlights and extends knowledge about why the current food environment is proving so detrimental to food intake and weight control. Our research indicates that it is not only the increased access to food today that has led to obesity; it is also the increased variety of food available today which is problematic. We believe this work can be used by health professionals and policymakers to increase public awareness regarding the effects of highly variable foods-for instance, guidelines and/or legislation might be introduced to limit exposure to highly variable foods as preventative measures for obesity, especially in children. For obese individuals, this work highlights the necessity of developing new strategies for managing intake of highly variable foods other than those that rely on estimates of energy content or satiation. Food companies and manufacturers might benefit from our work by using our methods to evaluate the variability of their food products and the impact of this factor on satiety. Generally, the wider public will benefit from an opportunity to take more informed control of the foods that they consume and the foods that they give their children.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>620A5DFA-794E-4F3C-8752-EE6452E74DB2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546336481c84c2.83303286</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bris.ac.uk/expsych/research/brain/nbu/currentprojects/bbsrcflav.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Nobel-prize winning research in the field of behavioural economics has shown that uncertainty biases human decision making in highly predictable ways. 'Prospect theory' is now well established and is used extensively to predict animal behaviour and a range of decisions in humans including judgements relating to gambling, financial trading, and risk taking. However, these principles have not yet been applied to understand food choice and dietary behaviour.

One measure that has been used to examine responses to uncertainty is 'loss aversion'. Loss aversion refers to the tendency to avoid choices that might result in a loss of some kind. This characteristic is typically measured with a gambling task where the participant is faced with uncertain odds and must decide on each trial whether to gamble (and risk losing, or gaining, a monetary reward). 

For the first time, we've adapted this task to assess how individual differences in risk taking (i.e., loss aversion) influence dietary decisions. Briefly, participants are presented with a portion of food that they are told will serve as their main meal. On each trial, however, the participant can choose to gamble in order to receive a different portion of food (i.e., one that is of a larger or smaller portion than his current portion). This task allows us to assess, a) whether individuals who show high levels of monetary loss aversion also make more cautious decisions when it comes to gambling for food (i.e., are more likely to gamble to increase their portion in an effort to avoid the adverse consequences of feeling hungry / experiencing the 'loss' of satiation) and, b) whether individual differences in the ability to tolerate food loss (i.e., eating more or less than one would prefer) predicts one's risk of overeating.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9B18E864-D8C3-4387-94B6-273AF7FD3A32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We expect that this method will shed new light on how decision-making processes impact food choice and intake, and introduce a new way of understanding ingestive behaviour (i.e., via prospect theory).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54634c5e824ef3.67770120</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Measurement of food loss aversion</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The consumption of food triggers a series of physiological responses that serve to optimise the digestion, absorption and use of the ingested nutrients. These responses can also be conditioned (cephalic phase responses) and, so, can be elicited by cues that have previously predicted food intake. Thermogenesis (i.e., the increase in body temperature which occurs immediately before and during eating) is one such cephalic phase response that can be conditioned by food cues. Typically, the stronger the association between a food cue and its associated caloric outcomes, the greater the magnitude of its cephalic phase response (i.e., the greater the thermogenesis). 

In order to establish links between food-cue reactivity, dietary variety, and cephalic phase responses, our research team collaborated with Dr. Mike Halliwell at the School of Clinical Sciences and Dr. Jeremy Burn at the School of Anatomy to develop a non-invasive method for measuring thermogenesis in humans. In rats, thermogenesis has been assessed by implanting temperature-sensitive recording devices in the abdomen, near the location of the liver. Our approach consists of placing temperature-sensitive recording devices (thermistors) on the outside of the abdomen in the location of the liver. Ultrasound scanning (sonography) is used to identify the precise location of the liver for each participant, and temperature recording is collected from three independent thermistors which provide second-to-second recordings of core temperature change. This method allows for the continuous monitoring of thermogenesis for groups of participants, simultaneously.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F09473F4-7923-453B-BEB3-C9BC049552D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Until now, methods for assessing core temperature in humans has been limited to procedures which are invasive (ingestible capsules; rectal probes) and quite expensive (indirect calorimetry via respiration chambers). Our technique capitalizes on what is already known about assessing thermogenesis in non-human animal models to provide a non-invasive, cost-effective method for monitoring core temperature in humans. This method does not require expensive / unwieldy equipment and, as such, recordings can be collected from multiple participants simultaneously and can be conducted outside of the laboratory. We expect this methodology will impact scientists by offering a relatively cheap, reliable, and flexible way of assessing thermogenesis in humans.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54622816c50c72.80309802</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Continuous assessment of diet-induced thermogenesis</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1242E0E7-CC7E-484B-BF26-C9CE0E0A87BB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evaluating predictors of BMI.
