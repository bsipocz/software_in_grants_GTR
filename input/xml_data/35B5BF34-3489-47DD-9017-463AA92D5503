This workshop presented an excellent opportunity to engage with key individuals and centres focused in atopic eczema research. 
The significant unmet clinical need, discovery of FLG mutations predisposing to atopic eczema and particular sub-phenotypes, recent insight into other genetic and environmental risk factors and emerging biological therapies, means that atopic eczema provides an important paradigm for a stratified medicine approach. Moreover, the NIHR infrastructure and our established collaborations means that the UK is uniquely placed to deliver such an integrative and multidisciplinary project. We invited interested physicians, researchers, potential industrial partners, stake holders and patient representatives to be involved from the start. Our plans are to work together over a 12-month period to construct a credible case for support that would enable the formulation of grant applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd7dda796851.50441107</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.newcastleptd.com/uktrend/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EIT Health:  Innovation Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4AFAFD60-6B2A-4C61-9F7C-4A2230A27BF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>EIT Health Innovation Day was aimed at boosting the entrepreneurial spirit among students from different disciplines and kick-starting innovation in the area of health and ageing.
