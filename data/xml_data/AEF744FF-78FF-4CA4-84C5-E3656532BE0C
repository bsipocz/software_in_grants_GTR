Provisionally entitled 'How Connected is Your Community?', this will use measures of connectedness based upon data gathered in the first three 'Taking Part in England' surveys run by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport over 2005-2007, to visualise the geographic distribution across England. A prior study of the Netherlands in 2005 suggested that connectedness is multi-faceted, relating to education, political and financial access, personal support, and personal skills. We similarly expect that there may be three or more types of connectedness in England. An interactive online map would help disseminate and visualise such findings in the English context. \n\n'Born digital' interactive resources have been proven to be extremely popular and influential. An important academic example is the 'Vision of Britain through Time' online database, which began life as the doctoral project of geo-historian Ian Gregory (www.visionofbritain.org.uk). A recent influential non-academic example is Experian's map of 'resilience' by local authority (www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11233799). Another is provided by Yorkshire Futures (www.yorkshirefutures.com/pirlive/singlemap/atlas.html). We would expect the resulting resource to be used heavily by academic and applied researchers as well as the general public.\n\nSecond, the student would provide detailed reports using this data on social connectedness for the seven locations to be studied by the RSA as part of their own 'Connected Communities' programme. This would explain the main drivers of individual-level connectedness as well as exploring the data for neighbourhoods at the middle super output area (MSOA) unit (where population is about 7000) within the seven relevant local authorities. The MSOA was developed to look at the importance of community context for social outcomes, and to be consistent over time, unlike other area units. Analysis of the community context is critical to the project.\n\nThird, the student will apply social psychological theory regarding the role of social networks in influencing individual behaviour, to assist in evaluating the RSA interventions. This could involve in-depth study of programme participants, using a 'mixed method' approach combining qualitative methods and psychometrics.\n\nThe project timetable envisages the student working at the RSA for a period of fourteen months, during which the RSA will be piloting psychological and behavioural interventions to improve connectedness and well-being in seven locations. During this time the non-academic supervisor will schedule a weekly meeting with the student, but will also be available as a colleague to guide research and analysis.\n\nThe fieldwork, pilots and case studies to be run by the RSA as part of their own 'Connected Communities' programme are integral to the doctoral project. The collaborative nature of the research project will greatly assist the student in applying social network theory, and statistical findings from national surveys, to individuals within unique contexts, adding nuance to findings from desk research. The student will be able to conduct in-depth study of participants, via in-depth interviews and/or questionnaires including a variety of personality measures as well as measures of social connectedness, relationship quality and well-being. \n\nThe results will form a powerful evidence base to inform the design and delivery of policy interventions, for the benefit of government organisations, charities and the voluntary secto</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect that there will be considerable interest from academics, policy-makers and the wider media in the results from the proposed study.\n \nAmong researchers, particularly those working outside social survey research, some of the findings on 'social capital' have appeared both unconvincing and inaccessible. The student will aim to clarify that connectedness has different qualities, and make the results of such research accessible through online visualisation methods.\n\nAmong policy researchers, until recently the ills of society have been thought to be primarily economic in origin, and interventions duly economic in nature: public spending, employment creation, regulation or deregulation. However, many issues have remained 'wicked': long-run unemployment, child poverty, social immobility, and health inequalities, particularly in mental health. In addition, public finances are currently constrained and light-touch, microtargeted interventions are being sought as an alternative.\nAccordingly, the policy debate has been changing. One example is the interest shown in 'paternal libertarianism' as popularised by Richard Thaler, another the appeal of David Cameron's 'Broken Britain' slogan and the 'Big Society' initiative. Regarding the role for policy, David Halpern of the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit has recently written that 'policy has systematically underestimated the importance of... the parallel economy of everyday life within which we help each other acts of consideration, care and reciprocity'.\n \nThe RSA's larger programme involves examining how interventions affect relationships and attitudes, and how relationships and attitudes affect individuals' and communities' propensity to foster better individual and aggregate wellbeing. The doctoral research will sit within this larger programme, which will help inform policy analysis and media debate. To that end, we suggest the following dissemination strategy.\n\nFirst, the student will be involved with the RSA's own research programme's outreach and dissemination strategy. The RSA plan is to disseminate findings from its action research through community-based workshops, seminars organized by RSA, academic papers and articles in journals, websites, and local and national media.\n\nSecond, in addition to the RSA's own networks, the Institute for Social Change has good contacts with writers and researchers in print journalism, Whitehall (particularly the Strategy Unit at the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury), and the think tank sector, to which the web resource and academic findings can be promoted. \n\nThird, the Institute for Social Change has, since inception in 2007, collaborated in the 'Social Change: a Harvard-Manchester initiative', or SCHMi, thereby building significant experience in writing reports for policy impact and in generating media interest. These include reports on immigration and civic engagement, and a third planned on religion to be published in 2011. \n\nFourth, ISC will seek to raise funds to organise an evening seminar in London to promote the doctoral research results alongside further collaborative work arising from the relationship with the RSA, from ISC's ongoing research programme, and from complementary research conducted bye colleagues elsewhere. \n\nIn sum, the proposed project takes 'impact' seriously; possesses the capacity with which to engineer impact; and has a realistic but ambitious plan to achieve it.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025107/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
