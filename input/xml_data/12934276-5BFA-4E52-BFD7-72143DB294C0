physical activity has great potential for improving public health. The trends towards sedentary living have their origins in changes at community and societal levels indicative of shifting cultural norms. A ?natural experiment? afforded by a major urban regeneration Big Lottery Award will be used to study the impact of environmental change and the creation of an urban ?Greenway? in East Belfast, on physical activity levels and the social capital for further public health gain . A multi-disciplinary research team will first engage with the local community to shape the detailed research plans and devise appropriate social marketing material for the Greenway. Members of the local community and East Belfast Partnership will join the researchers in monitoring the project over its five years and in preparing final evaluation reports. The engagement of the research team from the UKCRC Centre of Excellence for Public Health (NI) with key stakeholders and decision makers will enhance the translation of findings into more informed policy and practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Connswater Community Greenway (CCG) is one of three 2008 Big Lottery Living Landmarks awards and is a major environmental improvement project in East Belfast, which will connect 379 acres of public open space, building 43 bridges and 19kms of cycle and walkways. Around 40,000 people, most from inner city deprived neighbourhoods and living adjacent to CCG, will, by 2013, benefit from a better living environment, opportunities for leisure, exercise, recreation and support for healthier lifestyles.
We will use the opportunity afforded by this ?natural experiment? to design a systems-based approach to the promotion of physical activity (PA) and thereby determine the ability of individual, community and organizational networks and of the characteristics of the local environment to change behaviours. The cost effectiveness of this socio-ecological approach will also be assessed.
Using a PRECEDE-PROCEDE framework, a multi-stakeholder team will first engage with the targeted communities and devise a logic model for a suite of PA promotion interventions involving statutory and voluntary bodies in the CCG area. A baseline survey will be conducted of a random sample of households in the electoral wards of the CCG area before the urban regeneration project begins. This will assess attitudes to and levels of habitual physical activity, perceptions of the characteristics of the environment associated with active travel and physical activity, individual and social networks and their potential influence on their behaviour. A contemporaneous survey by SportNI of PA behaviours across Northern Ireland will generate a number of ?comparator? communities with which CCG will be compared. Process measures to judge the ?dose?, fidelity and costs of implementing interventions will include an assessment of the changes in ?walkability?, awareness and take-up of PA promoting interventions, the trends and patterns of activity of novel PA ?loyalty? scheme users, and the use made of new environmental amenities or different types of transport. These will be enriched by a qualitative and quantitative study of the voluntary and statutory stakeholder partnerships during the implementation period (2009-2013). A repeat survey of CCG households, more than six months after the completion of the Connswater Greenway construction will be timed to coincide with a further province wide survey of physical activity behaviours conducted by SportNI. 
Primary endpoints will be the change in the proportion of residents in the CCG area who achieve recommended levels of PA (150mins per week), over the period 2009-2013, compared to other parts of Belfast and Northern Ireland.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1085831</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Yale University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>ESRC Future Research Leaders application</gtr:description><gtr:id>F264E11F-2FCC-4D78-BB5A-3150151F6BE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An application was made to the ESRC Future Research Leaders scheme (unsuccessful).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>mhAfWmUwCbV-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The project collaborators provide specific expertise and have made significant contributions to the application in the following areas: a senior researcher from Yale University has contributed knowledge in regards to the use of incentives for public health behaviour change; a senior researcher from Deakin University has provided expertise in the area of designing physical activity interventions, and a senior researcher from the MRC Methodology Hub has made key contributions in regards to the design, implementation and analysis of complex public health interventions.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Dr Ruth Hunter has applied for an ESRC Future Research Leaders award which builds on our work investigating the effectiveness of a Physical Activity Loyalty Card for behaviour change.

To date, 24 parks wardens have undergone training in SOPARC methodology and using the app.
In terms of impact, the data collected using the app has been used to evaluate the effects of a Dog Enclosure in a park in North Belfast.

To date, 24 parks wardens have undergone training in SOPARC methodology and using the app.
In terms of impact, the data collected using the app has been used to evaluate the effects of a Dog Enclosure in a park in North Belfast.

An update on the PARC study is presented each quarter, which increases awareness and knowledge of the research project locally.

The increased awareness of the research project has aided response rates and participation in various aspects of the study, including the household survey, semi-structured interviews and focus groups, and recruiting 17 volunteers to take part in data collection on the SOPARC sub-study.
Presentations at this fora has also helped raise awareness of the importance of physical activity to local residents and highlights the Connswater Community Greenway as a key resource to be more active.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>oDwSC73Ewyh</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010,2011,2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prof Steve Cummins visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CB7B332C-6FFE-4F38-A156-2F5BDAB02A69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Steve Cummins, Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was invited to our research centre to give a seminar entitled &amp;quot;Measuring environmental exposure in physical activity and diet research: some thoughts from ORiEL (and other) studies&amp;quot; on 17th February 2014.

During analysis our attention was centred not simply on how many times a given item or element was referred to in speech, but also on how the codes were co-associated in the talk of the participants - that is, on how things were linked. Using novel methods of content analysis (Prior, 2014), the results can be visualized in what we refer to as 'issue webs'. Diagrams are drawn with the aid of the social network analysis programme Pajek. The size of the nodes is proportional to the number of references to the code made by the participants (excluding the moderator). A square root function is used to transform the data so as to manage the wide disparity in the number of references to, say, 'walking' as against 'summer' and to render the web more readable (so raw differences in node size can be considerable). The thickness of the arcs (or lines) between the nodes is proportional to the strength of the co-association between codes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>76E89063-AD94-4538-B8ED-E82F809DC24D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This has resulted in a publication in Social Science and Medicine; Exploring lay views on physical activity and their implications for public health policy- a case study from east Belfast (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614003098).
Prof Prior has also published a book that details this novel method of analysis: The Oxford Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods.
