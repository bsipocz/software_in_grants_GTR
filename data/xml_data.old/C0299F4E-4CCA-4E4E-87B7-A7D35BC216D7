It does this through a focus on thinking around the longstanding problematic of 'externalities'. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The market economy - and indeed the corporate economy - has always generated externalities. Such externalities can be understood as the consequences or side effects of market exchange. Externalities have been at the heart of the financial crash of 2008-09. Originally economists focused on the negative externalities of industrial commodity exchange on the welfare of the working classes. As important today are the effects of the economy on the environment. In both cases public goods must be created to compensate for market failure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This network will explore 'social externalities' in the rising powers, especially China, India and the UK. It will look at the social, financial and environmental consequences of the accelerated growth in the rising powers and at the various types of public goods that have emerged in response. The network comprises three workshops - in China, India and the UK, with three attached international visiting fellowships. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78924</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social externalities workshop III (London) - rising powers &amp; social externalities : rethinking the public sphere</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A84AE3BB-CD7D-4936-86D7-FF69B1B8C3C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Rising Powers &amp;amp; Social Externalities: Rethinking the Public Sphere

This workshop followed on from a very successful colloquium held in Beijing in October 2010, and foreshadows a London workshop in June 2011. The workshop was the first stage in developing a research network supported by the British Economic and Social research Council that interrogates the dynamics of the 'Rising Powers' in the BRICS.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-956316330.42946112b494ad8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/event/social-externalities-workshop-2-economy-and-culture/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social externalities : economy and urbanism in China</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FDC79204-A7D9-4422-A0BD-B0B3D7888BBF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Rising Powers workshop No, 1</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3373164938.17899852b35ec36</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The four principal British members of the research consortium (Michael Keith, Oxford, COMPAS), Scott Lash (Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths), John Driffill and Sandeep Kapur (both Economics, Birkbeck) provided academic leadership of the three symposia. All lead academics drew on their networks in India, China and the UK to generate interdisciplinary discussion between economists and social theorists considering the conceptual challenge of understanding the social extermnalities of the growth of the BRICs. Details of the symposia can be found at http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/research/dynamics/social-externalities-china-india-africa/. 

As early career academics, 3 research fellows provided both research support for the symposia and used the network to develop individual publications. Along with the website for the network a series of working papers were drafted to reflect some of the debates of the symposia. The three fellows also developed both personal networks and secondary publications from their association with the network. Two fellows (Sundaram from Sarai in the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies and Jiang Jun founder of the premier China architecture journal Urban China) used their honorarium to fund a period of sabbatical study in London, working with British members of the network (Michael Keith (COMPAS, Oxford), Scott Lash (Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths), John Driffill and Sandeep kapur (Ecomics, Birkbeck) and engaging in public events.

The network fed directly into the development of the major research grant application to the ESRC Rising Powers initiative involving the four British members of the network which - whilst very strongly supported positively by two referees - did not succeed. However, ideas developed through the network led to sustained and ongoing collaborations involving many permutations of those involved and the published work of principal researchers, early career research fellows and the participants of the thre symposia.

The research network made a direct impact on the audiences that were present in the symposia and colloquia that were developed as the core of the network's programme. 

The second set of audiences is more general. The 'social externalities' frame of reference has been central to a series of high profile plenary addresss that consider how the growth of cities in the global south and the BRICS reconfigure the problem of social externalities. These have been addressed to events that have drawn a wide range of urban policy makers including mayors of major cities, high profile public and private sctor representatives. Developing from our collaboration with the World Bank these have taken place at the following events:

These presentations have attracted press attention including most recently comment in the Financial Times (Simon Kuper, 'Priced Out of Paris; June 14th 2013; http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a096d1d0-d2ec-11e2-aac2-00144feab7de.html#axzz2Wk5JnFUa)</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C915C019-FA1A-40FA-965C-F7BDCA5A1A8D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54632f0b637a14.20078935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As a research network designed to develop capacity, collaborative work and stimulate new interdisicplinary doialogue there was no single set of 'findings' genereatd by the network itself. However the collaborations initiated both further funding proposals and scholarly collaborations. Scientific impact was also generated through the early career development of research fellows associated with the programme. Jiang Jun was appointed to a prestigious position in the Strelka Institue for Architecture and Urbanism in Moscow and Will Davies to a lectureship in the University of Warwick Centre for Interdisicplinary Studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The three symposia were conducted in the India Habitat Centre in Delhi, Studio X Beijing hutong conference space of Columbia University Architecture Programme and the board room of Canary Wharf Group in London (the latter two venues leveraged on a complementary basis as part of the network partnership). Each of these events involved bringing together a major international interdisciplinary group considering the theoretically innovative formulation of social externalities in the Rising Powers. 

There have been five principal audiences for the scientific impact of the network. Firstly, the academic audience of the three symposia which brought together high reputation scholars and stakeholders from different disciplinary backgrounds to engage in interdisciplinary dialogue based on prepared presentations and extensive critique and informal discussion. Secondly, two of the attached research fellows spent time in London on sabbatical leave and participated in a major event at Goldsmiths College: 'Emerging Publics: A Geo-Political Forum' (June 2, 2011) attended by over 250 researchers and graduate students. Thirdly, the working papers series was published online and downloaded freely from the COMPAS website. Fifthly both the research monograph (Keith et al) and other research outputs that were linked to the research network have been written to address an academic audience and will over time generate appropriate citation indices and references.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CA132B86-83E3-40BC-8BC1-DFD3D0EF8357</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54632e98542b91.28064435</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/research/dynamics/social-externalities-china-india-africa/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E24A6782-147A-4865-ACE9-091317D1CE25</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Urban Imperative: Towards Competitive Cities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35adbaa841f385a55e401f0d760ccfa2"><gtr:id>35adbaa841f385a55e401f0d760ccfa2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Keith, M.
