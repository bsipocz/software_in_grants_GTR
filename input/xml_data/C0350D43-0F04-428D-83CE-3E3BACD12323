Frescoes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J014338/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Reconstruction of fragmented objects is of great interest in archaeology, where artefacts are often found in a fractured state, and the effort of manually putting the broken pieces together represents a significant amount of time and resources. Representative of this problem is our work on documenting and reconstructing fragments of Late-Bronze-Age wall paintings from the site of Akrotiri on the volcanic island of Thera (modern-day Santorini, Greece). As is common in archaeological finds, the wall paintings are excavated as tens of thousands of pieces, and searching for matches is a daunting manual process that dwarfs the available resources.

In a previous project we have contributed methods to acquire object fragments efficiently, identify pairwise matches between fragments, interactively refine automatically suggested matches and automatically assemble them into larger clusters. However, unavoidable error sources in acquisition and processing, but also physical influences, such a erosion and other damage over the last 3,500 years, lead to uncertainty in identifying matches between fragments. We find that humans are required to sift the automated match suggestions and that without massively parallelising and without introducing redundancy in the manual sifting, there will always be a substantial number of matches go unnoticed.

This work proposes a crowdsourcing solution to obtain this goal. We believe that a key novelty lies in the fact that we are trying to let non-expert solve a problem in the digital domain that normally requires experts to operate in the physical domain. We believe that we are excellently positioned to turn this into a high-impact project with generalisable outcomes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will be conducted in close collaboration with the Akrotiri excavation (who provides space, expert time and access to frescoes) and with Microtask Oy, a very successful startup company specialised on commercial crowdsourcing (Microtask will consult the principal investigator free of charge); Microtask have received significant attention for their digitisation project with the National Library of Finland (http://www.microtask.com/media). From the beginning on, this will ensure that the scope of the project will stay relevant and that the execution is technically sound.

While there are currently no plans for a direct commercialisation during the two-year run time of this project, Microtask have indicated to be interested in helping with a commercialisation beyond the run time of this project.

The Akrotiri Excavation is hoping to be able to continue using our system as a key element of upcoming assembly phases at the site.

In addition, to identify applicable problem domains beyond fresco reassembly as such, we will:-

 * Actively seek contact with conservators and archaeologists who face assembly problems as well. In fact, we previously already received requests from curators that work with various broken artefacts, ranging from flint stone figurines, over human bones, to plaster statuettes, tomb stones, papyri, and even fragments of entire buildings. While these objects are typically hard to digitise with our current acquisition pipeline, human help in the match finding task may pose weaker requirements on the digitisation phase, so that our crowdsourcing approach could allow for the assembly of artefacts that otherwise would remain fragmented, be it due to time and money constraints, or because of the scale of the problem. 

 * Conduct mini-workshops at the upcoming Griphos Seminars at Akrotiri, to brainstorm with conservators and archaeologists on additional opportunities.

 * Follow traditional scientific publication strategies to advertise our work.

The larger consortium of participants in the Griphos project will continue exploring additional funding sources, in Greece, the UK, Europe and the US. The Akrotiri excavation has already identified a fresco (from building Xeste 3, room 7) that will be put aside exclusively for our research. Provided sufficient funding is found, Akrotiri would dedicate space and two conservators to work with us on improving our system and to study the assembly procedure under fully controlled conditions, rather than having to conduct our research in parallel to the conservative assembly procedure. If this plan succeeds (earliest in summer 2012), it would offer an additional testbed for the research planned in this proposal.

With respect to a broader audience, the Griphos project has regularly attracted attention in the international press, with articles on various web portals, but also general newspapers, including the Philadelphia Inquirer (a two-page feature), EPOC (a German science magazine which is part of Scientific American) and various Greek newspapers. We will continue to capitalise on the general attractiveness of the subject, in the hope to not only inform a broader audience, but also to make new connections to problem domains previously not thought to be in reach for computer technologies. We also expect that in advertising the crowdsourcing app to visitors of the Akrotiri excavation, we will gain additional visibility for crowdsourcing solutions.

On the educational side, we believe that both the RA and one of my research students who works on fresco assembly will benefit from having received training in a really exceptional problem domain.

More generally, while the immediate scope of our project is to develop a system that is geared toward the assembly of wall paintings, we intend to pursue this development with generality in mind, seeking general applications in the humanities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98209</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Yale University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Yale Center for British Art</gtr:department><gtr:description>Yale University</gtr:description><gtr:id>F78C70D2-F238-4FFB-A61E-424926F14499</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Open-source software Hyper3D.

In summary, the following forms of impact have been achieved:

1) New connections created between engineers and humanities scholars, not just within our own institutions, but also elsewhere, as a consequence of public engagement.

2) In particular, I was invited to join the Steering Board of the Eurographics Workshop on Graphics and Cultural Heritage, a conference that sees the two areas on equal footings and promotes trans-disciplinary works between the two.

3) Similarly, I was invited to join the Association for Historical and Fine Arts Photography's (AHFAP) special interest group Libraries and Archives Imaging, where I am now actively helping to shape the digital future of archives and memory institutions.

4) New content for a taught module to raise awareness amongst students for the potential of technology in arts and cultural heritage.

5) Creation of consortia for joint grant proposals in the domain of digital cultural-heritage preservation.

6) A two-months sabbatical visit to the cultural heritage digitisation division CultLab3D of Fraunhofer Darmstadt, with the goal of developing industry-scale solutions for the heritage domain.

7) I am currently consulting conservators tasked with the reconstruction of the National Trust's Clandon House, which was substantially damaged in a fire in April 2015. One of the most precious features of Clandon House was a Baroque stucco ceiling, which is now shattered into pieces buried under the debris. We are currently investigating whether the methods developed for fresco reassembly can be applied to the stucco reconstruction problem as well.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>562E4CAE-416F-4AD6-97F7-D3AD8DC2A896</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464a526ae5459.56451974</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. We developed a mobile-phone app that allows volunteers of the public to contribute to match-finding amongst fragments of shattered frescoes. By now, the software is in beta status, and that beta version is downloadable from the Apple App Store for iOS devices, and we offer an Android version for direct download.

2. The app is assisted by a central server at UCL, which is constantly running and deals out match proposals to the mobile clients, to collect the volunteers' feedback on individual match configurations.

3. In tests with a comparatively small number of fresco fragments, we were able to show that even unskilled volunteers learn very quickly to assess fragment matches using our software. The surprising insight was that, even without expert feedback and advice, volunteers' performance in identifying correct matches increased over time, simply by continuing using the software.

4. We scanned fragments of an artificially created test fresco and created a high-quality digital database of 3D models of the fresco fragments. Many of our experiments used this database, and we are currently preparing to provide the database to other researchers via open access soon.

5. Through many public presentations, including key note speeches at international conferences, we raised awareness of how computer science and humanities can team up to solve problems in cultural-heritage preservation. Our activities directly resulted in intensified bonds between engineering and humanities faculties, as well as the creation of consortia for joint grant proposals to work on questions in digital cultural-heritage acquisition and preservation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>First and foremost, the system and methods developed aim at more efficient reassembly of broken historic wallpaintings. We know of a number of excavations that would be keen to use such a system, once its quality and cost-effectiveness are proven.

Future analysis will show what parameters within the crowdsourcing mobile-phone app affect user performance. (Such experiments could not be completed yet, due to limited access to an untouched historic wallpainting to conduct a large-scale study.) We anticipate that the respective insights will inform the increasingly popular field of crowdsourced problem solving.

We hope that, with our prototype software, we helped promoting the field of game-like incentive models for crowdsourcing. The goal is that volunteers contribute to solving problems that are hard for computers, by seemingly playing a computer game that in reality gathers partial problem solutions from the users.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5B65A3A0-78B2-4896-B6D5-D24AE0EF1634</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54649ff676f216.87232566</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://reality.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/griphos/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of AHFAP SIG Imaging &amp;amp; Visualisation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E107C7A1-A50D-4329-A372-DF826E5E1AEE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e13c6665a108.25974848</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>3D scan of about 200 fragments of a shattered modern-day fresco painted in a Late-Bronze-Age fashion.

Ultimately, we believe that the software will be able to assist various assembly projects in cultural heritage applications, and that its development will spawn additional, similar projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546474c786e503.35110673</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Beta version of Crowdsourcing iPhone App for Fresco Fragment Match Sifting</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://reality.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/griphos</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>379304A6-5E6E-4843-9E96-97A9F3250481</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reassembling Roman Plaster Fragments from Flanders Using Three-Dimensional Scanning and Automatic Matching</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c7e8056eb24ee7be3755272f3734ca06"><gtr:id>c7e8056eb24ee7be3755272f3734ca06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Laken L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464844b59d565.58601986</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9F7E0749-6229-43CF-AAAB-678A63D914F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Verification-Minimal Assembly of Fragmented Frescoes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3dceb4a794ca58ffc48f522e612ae48e"><gtr:id>3dceb4a794ca58ffc48f522e612ae48e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Garc?a Casta?eda, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546483bb226287.88501978</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D4805E71-F346-4AAF-AD59-9D272977A8B5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Heritage Imaging at UCL</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c448b853e6fd374b51eef84c86a2e80"><gtr:id>7c448b853e6fd374b51eef84c86a2e80</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Giacometti A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546338d2c10db2.00047275</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5040AEF5-71F6-4845-8674-6D38F9A06751</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digitally reconstructing the Great Parchment Book: 3D recovery of fire-damaged historical documents</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Digital Scholarship in the Humanities</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/234c7ce12c8b1be5c9ec1cd7a95a8d55"><gtr:id>234c7ce12c8b1be5c9ec1cd7a95a8d55</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pal K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7be0264b618.77851252</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2D8E7C62-4822-46F9-B71D-0DA3C29A309D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The value of critical destruction: Evaluating multispectral image processing methods for the analysis of primary historical texts</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Digital Scholarship in the Humanities</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c448b853e6fd374b51eef84c86a2e80"><gtr:id>7c448b853e6fd374b51eef84c86a2e80</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Giacometti A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dd8bce7ad906.75375356</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>780CFA20-2612-4FC8-9C48-725C56862328</gtr:id><gtr:title>Geometric Analysis in Cultural Heritage</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e0750c0eb1cd57e2af7417ff96826f7a"><gtr:id>e0750c0eb1cd57e2af7417ff96826f7a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pintus R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54633814e31c65.11152782</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>87D77C48-2AA8-42B0-83E9-4C68DE615397</gtr:id><gtr:title>Newton Spectrum: Nonlinear Text Browsing of a Large Corpus</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff572969b46e25cf99bcdb1fde3d31fb"><gtr:id>ff572969b46e25cf99bcdb1fde3d31fb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54633598b23b07.39248215</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J014338/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
