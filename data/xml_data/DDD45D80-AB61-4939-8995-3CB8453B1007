Industrially, these materials find widespread applications in foodstuffs, personal care products, oil extraction, fire-fighting, display technologies, coatings, etc. Common to them all is the presence of mesoscopic internal substructures on the scale of nanometers to microns: polymer molecules, emulsion droplets, foam bubbles, etc. These are relatively easily reorganised by an externally applied shear flow. In turn, this reorganisation feeds back on the flow field, leading to exotic nonequilibrium flow phenomena, and conferring macroscopic mechanical properties that are strikingly different from those of simple liquids and crystalline solids. In many cases, homogeneous flow is unstable above a critical shear rate. The system then separates into coexisting shear bands'' of unequal viscosities and internal organisation. This effect can equivalently be viewed as a nonequilibrium phase transition, or a flow instability. Industrially, instabilities such as these routinely hinder processing. Indeed, the plastics industry sees huge wastage through product defects caused by instabilities during manufacturing, while many production lines have a limited throughput rate above which the process becomes unstable. Understanding the exotic flow properties of these materials is thus of great practical importance. At the same time, it forms an active and challenging field of fundamental research, drawing on and contributing to concepts of nonequilibrium statistical physics.Rapid recent advances in experimental techniques have resulted in a large body of data showing that shear banded flows often display complex dynamics. In such cases, the response of the system to a steady applied shear flow is intrinsically unsteady. This can be seen in an erratic motion of the interface between the bands, for example. At present, it is not known whether this erratic response stems from a bulk instability in one of the bands; in the dynamics of the way the fluid slips at the wall; or in an undulatory instability of the interface between the bands. An important aim of the proposed research is to elucidate the dominant mechanism.Besides the flow-induced transitions just described, more familiar (equilibrium) phase transitions are thermodynamically induced. One example is the demixing of immiscible fluids (such as oil and water) at low temperatures into two phases of unequal compositions. A fascinating question then concerns the effect of an applied shear flow on this process. For polymeric mixtures, shear can prematurely trigger demixing at temperatures above the normal (equilibrium) transition temperature. This effect is called shear-induced demixing''. In contrast, below the equilibrium transition temperature, thermodynamic demixing can actually be arrested by an applied shear: the system fails to demix fully, and arrests in a emulsified state comprising small domains of the two different phases. This brings an apparent paradox: that mechanical driving can trigger shear banding and shear-induced demixing; but arrest thermodynamic demixing. To resolve this, I aim to develop a unified theoretical understanding of shear banding, shear-induced demixing, and thermodynamic demixing under shear in complex fluids. Within it, I propose to explore outstanding questions concerning the kinetics of viscoelastic demixing and emulsification under shear. Commercially, issues such as these directly concern the shelf life and processability of these substances.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>445930</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This fellowship grant was in the research area of soft condensed matter physics, which concerns complex fluids such as polymers, colloids, liquid crystals, foams, emulsions and their biological counterparts. Its methods were theoretical, combining analytical calculation with counterpart computational study, but always maintaining a close interplay with experimentalists and the

experimental literature.



Its particular focus was the onset of instabilities and transitions from simple to more complicated states in situations where these fluids are taken far from equilibrium with their environment. This can occur either by (A) the fluid being driven externally by an applied flow, or (B) internal activity within the fluid's own bulk (in a suspension of swimming microbes, for example).



(A1) Many complex fluids, when subject to an applied shear, display a transition from a state of initially homogeneous flow to a state of coexisting shear bands of differing viscosity. Often these bands display complicated dynamics, which may be time-periodic or erratic and chaotic. However most pre-existing theory predicted steady bands separated by a stationary flat interface. This project has better elucidated the conditions under which an interface between shear bands becomes unstable to the onset of undulations; or when a bulk instability in one band instead dominates the

dynamics. [Collaborators: Prof. A. Ajdari (Paris), Dr P. Nghe (Paris), Prof. P. Tabeling (Paris), Dr. H. Wilson (London).]



(A2) The criterion for shear banding in fluids that are in a steady, time-independent state has long been known. However most practical flow situations involve a strong time-dependence, whether perpetually or during a transient evolution during which a steady shear flow is established in a fluid that was initially at rest. To address a large body of existing experimental data this project has derived universal criteria for the onset of shear banding in time-dependent flows of complex fluids. It has also taken the first steps to understanding an important counterpart of this effect in extensional

flows. [Collaborators: Dr. J. Adams (Surrey), Prof. M. Cates (Edinburgh), Miss R. Moorcroft (Durham), Prof. P. Olmsted (Leeds).]



(A3) The project has tackled the basic question of whether the demixing of two immiscible fluids (oil and water, say) can still proceed to completion when the system is subject to an applied shear flow, or whether the agitation caused by the applied flow breaks up domains of the separate fluids and thereby re-emulsifies the system.



(A4) New models for the deformation of solid-like glassy polymers have been developed, and have captured for the first time experimental data published in the journal Science. [Collaborators: Prof. M. Cates (Edinburgh), Miss R. Moorcroft (Durham), Prof. R. Larson (Michigan).]



(B) Besides fluids that are driven out of equilibrium by a flow applied externally at the system's boundaries, a new field of research has opened up in the last decade concerning fluids that are rendered far from equilibrium by an activity inherent within their own bulk. Examples here include suspensions of swimming microbes, and the actively crosslinked polymeric matrix of the biological cell cytoskeleton. The fellowship has provided me with an ideal opportunity to springboard into this area: building on my experience of (A) and beginning to cross fertilize ideas from it. In particular it has involved two computational studies of biologically active fluids: one using a course grained model that averages over the dynamics of many active particles; and another developing a new method for studying the collective behaviour of many individual biological &amp;quot;squirmers&amp;quot;.

Yeomans (Oxford).]</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Please see &amp;quot;exploitation routes&amp;quot; This project concerned the fundamental theoretical physics of complex fluids, so is broad in its beneficiaries. Indeed it has contributed an enhanced knowledge to numerous industries concerned with: personal care products, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, plastics processing, coatings, display technologies, detergents, specialist drilling muds for oil extraction, etc. For example, ageing in soft glasses influences shelf life. Flow instabilities routinely hinder processing and have important implications for industrial plant throughput rates and their associated profits. Extensional instabilities are important in numerous practical contexts, such as fibre spinning. In other areas important to human affairs, my work on shear banding has already been cited by the geophysical and bread processing communities. During the course of this felllowship I have given seminars to and participated in sandpit sessions with two large industrial companies; and participated in an industrial day organised by the Durham Centre for Soft Matter, of which I am the physics coordinator.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6671404A-4697-4FB8-94D4-C0525362A46C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7981773324.293805774baad4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture/ Food and Drink,Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9DAFFCDB-667F-4C12-A1BF-46980F8B6748</gtr:id><gtr:title>The large amplitude oscillatory strain response of aqueous foam: Strain localization and full stress Fourier spectrum</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The European Physical Journal E</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/177503207ee50eb660647f10faaedf20"><gtr:id>177503207ee50eb660647f10faaedf20</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rouyer F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d072072978016d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>15CFAAFB-AC73-49BE-A783-FD73C95AE453</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shearing active gels close to the isotropic-nematic transition.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d826a49b85b4a1fbd9e7f88e9bfadb09"><gtr:id>d826a49b85b4a1fbd9e7f88e9bfadb09</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cates ME</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0520522cda259</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>809F9486-39BF-4C43-A472-1A6C2E58FE35</gtr:id><gtr:title>Role of inertia in nonequilibrium steady states of sheared binary fluids.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review.
