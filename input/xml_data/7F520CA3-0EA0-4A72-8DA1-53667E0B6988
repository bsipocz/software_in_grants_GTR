There was great interest in the projects under development, and in the supporting methodologies. The project team were also very active in communicating emerging outcomes, notably at events with a policy focus. The early strong progress is evident from the many interim outputs reported in this submission. Unfortunately, mid-project, the financial crisis occurred and carbon markets completely collapsed, with the result that the forestry projects could not fly. Whilst this was an important lesson to learn, it was a fundamental setback for JIFOR. However, the JIFOR team pressed on, completing the methodologies and making further presentations. Whilst JIFOR itself did not have the impact hoped for, its legacy is notable. Project team members continue to collaborate and have played a major supporting role in reaching international agreement on the Second Commitment Period of the Kyoto Protocol (KP2), including the adoption of Forest Management as a mandatory activity, along with its associated accounting rules. The Forest Research team went on to undertake related research for the European Commission that led directly to the 2012 EU Decision on LULUCF accounting. Several team members made major contributions to the IPCC Good Practice Guidance Supplement in support of KP2. JIFOR has also been a major influence behind the UK Woodland Carbon Code, developed by the Forestry Commission to support robust forest carbon projects. Former JIFOR team members at Bristol University and Forest Research continue to work closely with forestry and climate policy leads in the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C46EF12B-263A-4149-A76C-C50A3D846391</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56fc29b1122541.43441096</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>(1) It is possible to develop technically rigorous methodologies for forestry projects aimed at mitigating climate change, whilst delivering wider ecological and soial benefits from forests.
