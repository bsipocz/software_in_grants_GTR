non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including the impact of chronic infection-HIV and hepatitis viruses-on these diseases, across sub-Saharan Africa. With opportunities for research capacity strengthening and training, the partnership provides a unique research framework to design and conduct large scale studies that will provide more reliable and precise information on disease burden and underlying causes of these diseases. The partnership also provides a platform to increase critical mass and help foster research leadership at the institutions within the partnership. Importantly, the proposal brings together institutes with established and nascent research programmes aimed at studying NCDs at the population-level. The overall aim is to develop a sustainable partnership that will facilitate multi-centre research to assess the burden and aetiology of NCDs in SSA to improve the evidence base underpinning potential responses to NCDs, provide a platform for interventional research in NCDs, and to ensure that African populations benefit from the ongoing advances in genomics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The overall aim is to develop a sustainable partnership that will facilitate multi-centre research to assess the burden and aetiology of NCDs in SSA to improve the evidence base underpinning potential responses to NCDs, provide a platform for interventional research in NCDs, and to ensure that African populations benefit from the ongoing advances in genomics.

Specific objectives are to 1) establish a consortium of investigators and research institutes capable of conducting multi-centre research into NCDs in SSA; 2) devise and develop guidelines for research governance and scientific strategy for the NCD partnership; 3) devise and maintain a web-portal for sharing data, research resources (data collection tools and software, e-questionnaires, protocols, SOPs, analytical plans), and research training tools with the wider scientific community; 4) facilitate capacity strengthening, provide research training, and identify mechanisms to develop infrastructure for NCD population based research (observational studies, including genomic analyses, and intervention trials) in SSA; 5) enhance ongoing studies across the partnership by facilitating pooled collaborative analyses across multiple regions of SSA; and 6) develop partnership-wide research funding proposals.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The partnership will provide a platform for research that will allow a robust and accurate assessment of the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and help identify risk factors for infectious diseases and NCDs among populations in sub-Saharan Africa, informing governments and health agencies (local and international). This will primarily be communicated through scientific reports and healthy policy recommendations. This in turn may help inform health service planning and shape preventative and therapeutic strategies for NCDs across the region. Although individual centres vary, there is also some direct benefit to participants in the individual studies conducted at respective collaborating centres in relation to feedback and support for health indices, such as high blood pressure or obesity; however, the current proposal seeks to harmonise and utilise existing data and resources to assess the burden and causes of NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa.

For countries in SSA to benefit from future progress in NCD epidemiology, public health and genomics, there is a need to strengthen research capacity, training and collaboration across the region to ensure researchers can play a full part. The partnership will be underpinned by capacity-strengthening activities, including facilitating and promoting NCD epidemiological and genomic research, mechanisms and infrastructure to share research resources (study protocols, SOPs, e-questionnaires, data access), and training and support for the next generation of research leaders in Africa. As a concrete example, we propose to establish a one week course in the epidemiology and public health aspects of &amp;quot;global chronic disease epidemiology&amp;quot; with particular emphasis on regions undergoing epidemiological transition and the interrelation among chronic infection and NCDs. The development of this course will be led by the University of Witwatersrand and it will be a direct development of an existing course in chronic disease epidemiology embedded within the masters training programmes in epidemiology and public health at the University. To facilitate studies within the partnership, and to provide sustainable capacity building, we plan to develop a bioinformatics hub at the MRC/UVRI Uganda centre to facilitate data storage, management and access across centres. We aim to enhance existing capacity through the expansion of the existing network and server system and with the addition of a full-time data manager.

The NCD research community - particularly researchers working in African centres - will benefit from this investment in training and infrastructure; thus the partnership will provide an excellent framework to develop a sustainable international research programme for NCDs in SSA.

With the development of an international research partnership, including sharing joint resources, samples and data, and to ensure its sustainability (by developing local scientific leadership) and equable access to resources, it will be important to put in place mechanisms for research and resource governance. We aim to formalise such a mechanism within the partnership. Equally, this governance structure will provide a mechanism for the wider scientific community to access data and resources generated through the partnership, including electronic tools for data collection, harmonisation and analyses. More specifically, in the context of secondary research, efforts to harmonise study methods and data across centres, including the development of consensus documents, methods and tools that optimise the ability of contributing centres and researchers to participate and collaborate in cutting-edge science, will be a major focus of this partnership. These efforts will span key research disciplines including ethico-legal approaches, epidemiology, sample handling, genomics, information management systems, and biostatistics.

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into our human origins and the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease.[1 2] In these contexts, Africa represents the ancestral birthplace of modern humans.[3] Populations from Africa have the highest levels of genetic diversity.[4 5] This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene-disease association signals.[3] A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within Africa would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.

The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will importantly extend previous efforts to characterise population genetic diversity in Africa-informing population history and movement, evolutionary adaptation and disease susceptibility across Africa. Importantly, the GDAP will also help develop local resources and research capacity for public health and genomic epidemiological research, including approaches to strengthen research capacity, training, and collaboration across the region. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDAP aims to significantly advance the comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Africa started by the African Genome Variation (AGV) project (African Genome Variation), including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. 

My research team will sequence at low and high depth the whole genome of around 100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group, and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina array data from distinct regions within Africa. In total, we will aim to sequence up to 2,000 genomes. This resource will extend our understanding of our human origins, population history, and patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa. Furthermore, it will provide a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in Africa populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, thus complementing existing genomic resources.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Malawi</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Malawi, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>College of Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>H3A Diabetes</gtr:description><gtr:id>5FD88011-3444-4870-98B0-CCB166204A4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This partnership is still in its early stages.

Specifically we will sequence exomes from 200 individuals: roughly 100 individuals belonging to the 'elite-LTNP' group and 100 individuals from the 'rapid progression' group.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>HIV Genomics Consortium (HGC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>ADC84A60-4338-4866-BE10-B51363F96313</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The specific objectives of 'The HIV Exome Sequencing Study' were as follows:

4. To use fine mapping techniques to identify causal variants.

The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will importantly extend previous efforts to characterise population genetic diversity in Africa-informing population history and movement, evolutionary adaptation and disease susceptibility across Africa. Importantly, the GDAP will also help develop local resources and research capacity for public health and genomic epidemiological research, including approaches to strengthen research capacity, training, and collaboration across the region. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDAP aims to significantly advance the comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Africa started by the African Genome Variation (AGV) project (African Genome Variation), including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. 

My research team will sequence at low and high depth the whole genome of around 100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group, and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina array data from distinct regions within Africa. In total, we will aim to sequence up to 2,000 genomes.

This study design provides a research framework that will allow opportunities to: 1) conduct a detailed examination of T2D and its complications; 2) assess the risk factors associated with T2D and its complications, including environmental, behavioural, infectious and genetic risk factors; 3) examine the population distribution of these risk factors; 4) harness genomic technologies to understand the aetiology of T2D and its complications in SSA; 5) provide a platform for longer-term longitudinal studies of disease incidence; and 6) develop a sustainable resource to align case series of other diseases and traits to the cross-sectional surveys.

1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from Africa accessible to the global scientific community; 
2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across Africa; 
3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across Africa; 
4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci. 

These scientific objectives will be supported by cross-cutting operational activities, including network and management of the consortium, research ethics, and research capacity building in statistical genetics and bioinformatics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546494efc46dd9.63301627-11</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Research groups and institutions, other consortia, and health organisations working in the fields of population health, health service provision, and genomics in Africa will provide existing (biobanked) or new sample collections with appropriate research ethics consent.

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into our human origins and the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease.[1 2] In these contexts, Africa represents the ancestral birthplace of modern humans.[3] Populations from Africa have the highest levels of genetic diversity.[4 5] This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene-disease association signals.[3] A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within Africa would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.

The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will importantly extend previous efforts to characterise population genetic diversity in Africa-informing population history and movement, evolutionary adaptation and disease susceptibility across Africa. Importantly, the GDAP will also help develop local resources and research capacity for public health and genomic epidemiological research, including approaches to strengthen research capacity, training, and collaboration across the region. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDAP aims to significantly advance the comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Africa started by the African Genome Variation (AGV) project (African Genome Variation), including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. 

My research team will sequence at low and high depth the whole genome of around 100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group, and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina array data from distinct regions within Africa. In total, we will aim to sequence up to 2,000 genomes. This resource will extend our understanding of our human origins, population history, and patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa. Furthermore, it will provide a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in Africa populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, thus complementing existing genomic resources.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of Human Virology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Nigeria, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>H3A Diabetes</gtr:description><gtr:id>D4F77B8C-D458-4ABE-95F9-3B6CD1885F79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This partnership is still in its early stages. The general aim of the partnership is conduct a multi-centre population based cross-sectional survey-assessing the distribution and prevalence of a range of risk factors and quantitative phenotypes. We are currently working together to finalise the common study protocol and geographical sampling frame that will be used by all centres, enabling data from each site to combined with data from other centres for analysis.

This study design provides a research framework that will allow opportunities to: 1) conduct a detailed examination of T2D and its complications; 2) assess the risk factors associated with T2D and its complications, including environmental, behavioural, infectious and genetic risk factors; 3) examine the population distribution of these risk factors; 4) harness genomic technologies to understand the aetiology of T2D and its complications in SSA; 5) provide a platform for longer-term longitudinal studies of disease incidence; and 6) develop a sustainable resource to align case series of other diseases and traits to the cross-sectional surveys.

This project has been designed to provide a currently unavailable genome-wide view of common variation and a framework for statistically imputing genetic variants for genome wide association studies in anticipation of future larger-scale whole-genome sequencing endeavours in relevant populations.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>International Centre for Research and Development of Livestock in Subhumid (CIRDES)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Burkina Faso</gtr:country><gtr:description>Genetic Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP)</gtr:description><gtr:id>2742D745-70F9-4091-866E-27A4CAF798DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a recent collaboration and there is no tangible putput yet however our scientific objectives are to:

Importantly, the GDAP will also help develop local resources and research capacity for public health and genomic epidemiological research, including approaches to strengthen research capacity, training, and collaboration across the region. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDAP aims to significantly advance the comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Africa started by the African Genome Variation (AGV) project (African Genome Variation), including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. 

My research team will sequence at low and high depth the whole genome of around 100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group, and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina array data from distinct regions within Africa. In total, we will aim to sequence up to 2,000 genomes. This resource will extend our understanding of our human origins, population history, and patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa.

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into our human origins and the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease.[1 2] In these contexts, Africa represents the ancestral birthplace of modern humans.[3] Populations from Africa have the highest levels of genetic diversity.[4 5] This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene-disease association signals.[3] A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within Africa would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.

The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will importantly extend previous efforts to characterise population genetic diversity in Africa-informing population history and movement, evolutionary adaptation and disease susceptibility across Africa. Importantly, the GDAP will also help develop local resources and research capacity for public health and genomic epidemiological research, including approaches to strengthen research capacity, training, and collaboration across the region. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDAP aims to significantly advance the comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Africa started by the African Genome Variation (AGV) project (African Genome Variation), including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. 

My research team will sequence at low and high depth the whole genome of around 100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group, and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina array data from distinct regions within Africa. In total, we will aim to sequence up to 2,000 genomes. This resource will extend our understanding of our human origins, population history, and patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa. Furthermore, it will provide a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in Africa populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, thus complementing existing genomic resources.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Ibadan</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Nigeria, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>African Partnership for Chronic Disease Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>7A1E821A-84F8-4B22-8905-9486F150FAC4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two successful grant application have resulted so far from this partnership:

This study design provides a research framework that will allow opportunities to: 1) conduct a detailed examination of T2D and its complications; 2) assess the risk factors associated with T2D and its complications, including environmental, behavioural, infectious and genetic risk factors; 3) examine the population distribution of these risk factors; 4) harness genomic technologies to understand the aetiology of T2D and its complications in SSA; 5) provide a platform for longer-term longitudinal studies of disease incidence; and 6) develop a sustainable resource to align case series of other diseases and traits to the cross-sectional surveys.

Specifically, we will aim to: 1) examine the allele frequency spectrum of variants on the chip; 2) characterise patterns of LD and haplotype structure; 3) evaluate optimal study designs for African genomics; 4) investigate imputation-based approaches aiming to increase genetic association study power; 5) identify analytical challenges and develop statistical genetics methods to address them; 6) generate a valuable resource for the scientific community; 7) promote collaboration and synergies among contributing parties; and 8) provide a research framework and resource for additional analyses, for example studies of genome-wide selection, mapping genetic variation to linguistic and demographic differences, and evaluating powerful approaches for trans-ethnic meta-analysis and fine-mapping.

My research team genotyped 100 unrelated individuals from each of several ethnic or ethno-linguistic groups on the 2.5 million SNP Illumina HumanOmni chip. To corroborate our analyses we also included whole genome sequences for three of these groups. This work will inform genomic epidemiological studies in SSA by providing a reference for allelic, haplotype and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure for common variants in populations not covered by the HapMap project. This project has been designed to provide a currently unavailable genome-wide view of common variation and a framework for statistically imputing genetic variants for genome wide association studies in anticipation of future larger-scale whole-genome sequencing endeavours in relevant populations.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Walter Reed Afrims Research Unit</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Nepal, State of</gtr:country><gtr:description>VaccGene - Identifying the genetic determinants of vaccine response</gtr:description><gtr:id>0650BFB1-609C-46FA-A812-CB256B75F5B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Most samples have been collacted and alsyses are ongoing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464b55a172574.88862549-6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Jointly with our team the University of Oxford is guiding the research strategy and analysis design of the study.

1. To conduct a pilot study to identify host and viral genetic variants that contribute to control of HIV infection.
2. To develop a research framework for large scale studies in HIV genomics.
3. To replicate findings from the study within the proposed collaboration.
4. To use fine mapping techniques to identify causal variants.
5. To develop a generic research framework to study genetic determinants of other infectious diseases.

This pilot study has been completed and the data are being analysed in the context of other larger collaborations (HIV Eurocord, International HIV Acquisition Consortium (IHAC)).

Other outputs of the HGC to date have been the following manuscripts:

The workshop was organized by TReND-in-Africa and run from the 30th of November to the 5th of December 2015. Its main objective was to introduce the range of bioinformatics analysis techniques for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, and it was targeted at African research scientists. The participants were researchers from universities in Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Zambia, Uganda and a few other African countries.
Our main objective at this workshop was to liaise with the key people in TReND-in-Africa to explore a potential collaboration with the organization that would have them run programs at the UMIC data centre, being then directly organised by APCDR in partnership with TReND-in-Africa.
As a result of this site visit, it was agreed to run a joined workshop at UMIC in 2017, with APCDR and TReND-in-Africa acting as partners.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9aa2f4c4239.79041337</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UbuntuNet Alliance talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>75C95D5C-6475-4C87-A59B-9B1FEE9AE15E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UbuntuNet-Connect is the Annual Conference of UbuntuNet Alliance that focuses on research and education networking activities in Africa.
