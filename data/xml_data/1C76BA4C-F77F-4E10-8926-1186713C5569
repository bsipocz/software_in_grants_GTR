The chemical controls on volatility from high temperature silicate melts are, however, poorly understood and crude approximations are generally made. For instance, direct measurements of volcanic gas compositions must remove an estimated non-volatile, dust component, while the compositions of pre-planetary materials are estimated by assuming that gases condense and evaporate directly to/from solids (which are well understood) rather than to poorly-understood, but physically more realistic, silicate liquids.

Unfortunately, to explore the latter requires data that we currently do not posses - such as how volatile an element may be above a silicate (magmatic) melt and what the chemical controls upon volatility are. This basic chemical data is required to refine our understanding of key moments in Earth history, such as the impact that led to the formation of the Moon. These planetary scale events are modelled using complex numerical simulations, but to improve the fit between the observed chemistry of the Moon and that suggested by such models requires a deeper understanding of elemental volatility. 

The compositions of pre-planetary materials - the 'building blocks' of the terrestrial planets - are estimated by assuming that gases condense and evaporate directly to or from solids - a process which is, relatively, well understood compared to the condensation and evaporation from silicate liquids. This project will directly address this gap in our knowledge.

Volcanologists will also benefit by having improved models by which to understand the trace element compositions of volcanic gases. Knowledge of the factors that influence volcanic gas chemistry is key to interpreting the outgassing behaviour of terrestrial volcanic systems. The current method, of removing an estimated non-volatile, dust component, may be obscuring important information concerning magma evolution, and, potentially, volcanic hazards. Given the toxicity of many of the volatile elements, this project is important to both volcanologists and risk/hazard assessors.


In this project, I take a novel approach to measuring elemental volatility by firstly measuring the properties of trace components in silicate melts then predicting and testing their expected volatilities under controlled conditions. The immediate aim is to provide a data set of minor and trace element volatilities directly relevant to planetary evolution, volcanic and environmental hazards.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The data will feed into models of gas compositions arising from volcanic and industrially relevant silicate melts. A wide variety of users will interact with this data, ranging from the academic research community - cosmochemists, geologists and geological hazard assessors - to industrial users.

How will users benefit?

1. THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY
From an academic perspective, the lack of fundamental chemical data currently hampers a variety of fields. Firstly, planetary science uses models of planet formation that are based upon condensation of gases directly to solids, rather than physically more realistic scenarios that model element volatility arising from a molten silicate, accreting body. Unfortunately, the influence the silicate melt composition has on elemental volatility is, currently, poorly understood. 
Secondly, understanding what influences volcanic gas chemistry is key to interpreting the outgassing of terrestrial volcanic systems. The current method of removing an estimated non-volatile, dust component may be obscuring important information concerning magma evolution, and, potentially, volcanic hazards. 

This project will provide the essential data that will allow these gaps in our knowledge to be closed. The models developed will be directly applicable to these wide ranging problems.

2. POLICY MAKERS AND INDUSTRIAL USERS
Reducing the volatile, and often toxic, component of industrial fly-ash - a by-product of a variety of smelting operations, is obviously of key environmental importance. Knowledge of the chemical activity of volatile elements in a range of geological and industrial silicate melts, and hence their volatility, would feedback into the various industry standard thermochemical modeling packages (e.g. FactSage). These modeling packages are widely used in industry to predict and minimise the production of volatile rich vapour emissions and fly-ash. For some elements, however, they lack key chemical data such as gas-phase speciation. This project will rectify these omissions by making the data and models produced widely available. Additionally, the partitioning behaviour of a range of trace elements between metals and silicate - a key component of this project - will also expand and refine existing metallurgical models. These models are widely used both in industrial metals smelting processes and in academic research, but data coverage is occasionally poor for potentially important, but rare, elements found in industrial processes.

3. STUDENTS
Undergraduates will benefit directly from our research programme. We will develop small, self-contained 'spin-off' projects aimed particularly at Oxford undergraduate masters projects in Earth Sciences (MEarthSci). These will centre around performing a short series of experiments and using cutting-edge analytical equipment to obtain data.

4. MEDIA AND PUBLISHERS
The Department of Earth Sciences has a strong record of interaction with the media, with coverage of research in the international press, radio, and television. We will seek to capitalize on this and use these channels to promote the output of this project. We will engage with these users through conventional press releases, plus announcements made via the Oxford Science Blog (http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/science_blog/) and our own research group blog and website.

5. GENERAL PUBLIC
The work will benefit the public in terms of UK culture and quality of life. I actively engage with the public from the beginning of work via press releases, talks, and outreach through the University. 

6. MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT
I will further develop links between research groups in the department - in particular the isotope and volcanology groups. The research will be presented in group discussions and departmental seminars enabling the adoption of these techniques and data by other researchers in similar areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>562886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BGS open day -  attending as Nerc anniversary ambassador</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8D8C076-9FD7-47D5-B0DD-7A7A896C6C6A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Open day for the BGS - attended with demonstration of high pressure expt equipment - large audience over the day</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d71577978fb2.76849860</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bgs.ac.uk/news/events/openday/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UNIQ summer school</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A53728E8-5453-4D1D-9BD7-FE5C1D674AC8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UNIQ summer school for students from 'non-traditional' Oxbridge schools (i.e. schools that hadn't submitted or rarely submit an application to Oxbridge) . 15 students attended and I ran an afternoon lab demonstration focusing on how we make 'rocks' in the lab, followed by a mornings tutorial.

Another is in the final stages of preparation for American Mineralogist which aims to refine chemical micro-analyses made by the new generation of FEG-electron probes of geologically and industrially relevant materials. These instruments offer the prospect of high resolution (10's of nm) chemical analysis, but artefacts generated by the analytical conditions are potentially a problem. Here we use an example of solid-state oxygen sensors, often used in geological research, and show how the analyses (and inferences) can be improved.

I've presented research at McGill University, Montreal (invited seminar), Cardiff and Portsmouth Universities (dept seminar), and an industrially focused conference - Microscopy and Microanalysis 2014 - in Boston, US.

The Moon appears very similar to the Earth isotopically, but also very different in key elemental abundances. Previous chemical models of lunar formation have resulted in elaborate scenarios where isotopes of volatile elements were equilibrated between both bodies, but these models have failed to explain all the chemical similarities and differences. 

I have taken a slightly different approach and can show that the Moon is a chemical 'snap-shot' of the Earth immediately prior to the Moon forming event. The proto-Earth was more oxidised than at present, whereas the body that collided with it was a highly-reduced, Mercury-like body. 

This has potentially important implications for how we view the chemical evolution of the Earth and other planets - for instance, the chemical make-up of the Earth's mantle was, essentially, set by chance, rather than some inevitable consequence of planetary accretion. The ability of a planetary surface to retain water for geologically relevant timescales may also be affected by the mechanism of planetary formation, and this is something I am actively working on.

I have also co-presented two advanced electron probe courses that were attended by both students and industry representatives (Sandvik, JEOL, AWE and ITU). A paper is also in the final stages of preparation that investigates the capabilities of modern electron micro-probes to perform very high spatial resolution. chemical analyses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There's evidence of Archaean iron-rich rocks from Northern Canada that *may* represent domains of the early Earth that hadn't fully mixed with the impactor. To test the model they should be analysed isotopically, as their chemistry suggests a more iron-rich, Moon-like, source rather than the current chemistry of the silicate Earth. 

I will also be presenting another advanced electron probe course for Industry in 2015 and am working on refining the new generation of electron probes (FEG-EPMA) for higher spatial resolution and light-element chemical analysis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B264CC05-55E5-4126-BC6D-08173BB98611</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cfb2a24b890.18073280</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Chemicals,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Fundamentals Of EPMA - an EMAS Short Course</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>95A07813-3A2B-47B1-8457-B181C2102742</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e12d87659779.50602973</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/activities/fundamentals-of-epma--an-emas-short-course(eb95e3b8-1155-46d8-a8bc-c8a6b9b1cb0e).html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advanced Course on electron microbeam methods</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8E30C5B6-0007-471B-BDB3-654B83BA7F32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The course aims to give a deeper understanding of microanalytical techniques commonly used in Earth sciences, as well as materials.

The course follows up this three day series of lectures and demonstrations with three days of 'hands on' experience at various institutions. I hosted 6 attendees here in Oxford where we investigated the application of modern computer simulation techniques to real world analytical problems as well as high precision analysis using the EPMA here at Oxford. Feed back was good and as a result the course has been funded again for the next two years.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7f9a2a24794.06810498</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>37F8E355-3053-4D25-ADDE-DCA0631570CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>FEG-EPMA of Solid State Redox Sensors - the Effect of Secondary Fluorescence on Analytical Precision</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Microscopy and Microanalysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8eec587be914226f1bb19c5a4054d431"><gtr:id>8eec587be914226f1bb19c5a4054d431</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wade J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>14358115</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bb2e8430b852.91022488</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DED25DCA-3F5A-42E9-8E37-26B23002ECEE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constraining magma storage conditions at a restless volcano in the Main Ethiopian Rift using phase equilibria models</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a21b5aafe217e0bc94c641edd9206987"><gtr:id>a21b5aafe217e0bc94c641edd9206987</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gleeson M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b75288c0a5f3.77437494</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>304C4C3B-B308-4F34-81BD-2E5D3FCBA81E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The oxidation state and mass of the Moon-forming impactor</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8eec587be914226f1bb19c5a4054d431"><gtr:id>8eec587be914226f1bb19c5a4054d431</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wade J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d7138c8efd80.90042653</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>423D9EF0-EF59-4C13-ADCD-99D33C9D2CA5</gtr:id><gtr:title>The divergent fates of primitive hydrospheric water on Earth and Mars.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8eec587be914226f1bb19c5a4054d431"><gtr:id>8eec587be914226f1bb19c5a4054d431</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wade J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-0836</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a6f2f2bf3f271.65606372</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4B0612CF-A226-45DD-91F6-0C70B5BA2D70</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mitigating Thermal Beam Damage with Metallic Coats in Low Voltage FEG-EPMA of Geological Materials</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Microscopy and Microanalysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a1d28c77ba64b531ce590dbcc1a3ed61"><gtr:id>a1d28c77ba64b531ce590dbcc1a3ed61</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kearns S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>14358115</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bb2ed24cd859.06731491</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/K009540/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E4C03353-6311-43F9-9204-CFC2536D2017</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atmospheric phys. &amp;
