This study is in response to recent calls by a government interdepartmental group to explore the possibility of developing a short-term scheme for the surveillance of pesticide-related illness. The study will use general practices to find people who have reported recent pesticide exposure, with or without current symptoms, and those who have symptoms that their GP considers could be related to a recent pesticide exposure. The study will estimate the national incidence of pesticide related illness and present the incidence data by health effects, exposure circumstances, pesticide type and pesticide function. It also aims to advise on whether there are links between specific products and diseases and recommend on the potential for a permanent pesticide related health-monitoring scheme. The study will recruit 5000 patients with possible pesticide related illness over a 12-month period.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Pesticides are used widely in both agricultural and non-agricultural settings. Under the Food and Environment Protection Act (FEPA) 1985, a pesticide is defined as any substance, preparation or organism prepared or used, among other uses, to protect plants or wood or other plant products from harmful creatures; or to render such creatures harmless. Herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, rodenticides, wood preservatives, plant growth regulators and soil sterilants are among the many groups of substances classed as pesticides.||This study will estimate the incident of pesticide-related illnesses presented to and diagnosed by General Practitioners (GPs) in great Britain. The aims of the study are to: assess the nature and extent of pesticide-related illness seen by GPs in great Britain, and establish the potential for cost of a GP-based system for collecting data on pesticide-related illness. The main objectives were to: estimate the annual national incidence of illness diagnosed by GPs as pesticide related; estimate the annual national incidence of illness presented to GPs by patient s pesticide related; present the incidence data by health effects, exposure circumstances, pesticide type and pesticide function; advise on whether the initial analysis suggests any associates between specific pesticide products and disease, symptoms or syndromes; make recommendations on the potential for, feasibility of and costs of, setup permanent arrangements of collect data on pesticide related illness from this source; disseminate the findings through presentation and publication.||The study was conducted in collaboration with general practices that are members of the MRC General Practice Research Framework. Participating GPs identified patients with possible pesticide-related illness and/or exposure. These patients were interviewed by a research nurse when detailed information on pesticide use in occupational and home environments and data on potential confounding and other related factors were collected. The target was to identify and interview 5000 patients with possible pesticide related illness. Information for the main study will be collected over a year to allow for seasonal effects.||This study has been commissioned by the HSE and is being carried out by the MRC institute for Environment and Health (IEH) in collaboration with the MRC General Practice Research framework (GPRF).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>251680</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6A8F063E-794B-4B97-97E7-B7AB5C172732</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pesticide-related illness reported to and diagnosed in primary care: implications for surveillance of environmental causes of ill-health.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC public health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8988d10980780e81c3b7b9ce4d4c63b7"><gtr:id>8988d10980780e81c3b7b9ce4d4c63b7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rushton L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2458</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>CukjKkipzVs</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U122785834</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
