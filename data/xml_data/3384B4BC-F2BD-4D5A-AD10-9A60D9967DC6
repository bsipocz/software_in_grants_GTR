The Creative Practices of Anger is a multi-disciplinary network, drawing together a team of early-career researchers, working in a number of different fields - both creative and critical - and a series of research activities and case studies that together form a research project on what the role and potentialities of anger might be in communities. Drawing on a range of methodologies and including cross-diciplinary approaches, the project will undertake research with a number of communities, representing different ages and locations, experiencing rage and anger (of different kinds for different reasons). The research asks questions about what brings people individually, or collectively, in community, to experience their anger in productive or transformative ways and create, what Bourdieu terms, new &amp;quot;cultural capital&amp;quot;. 

The activities and analyses that make up this project, have been framed by the investigators' existing research interests, their disciplines, their critical (and in some case creative) practice, and their engagement with communities. Bringing this network of scholars together enables the exploration of patterns of relating/being with anger across the different communities and contexts. It does this by understanding the role of anger in acknowledging and transforming social and structural injustices across a range of communities and contexts. It is hoped that new understandings about how anger can be reconceptualised as a positive force will come about through bringing together these diverse experiences through the proposed knowledge exchange events and final community reflection and consolidation event.

Activity title: 

Performing Rage: young women and their expression of anger - led by Dr Helen Limon

In Angry Tongues: creative practices of anger in politicised poetry, song writing and performance - led by Dr Geoff Bright 

Narrating Injustice Artfully: how anger towards animal cruelty and species loss is enacted and told through story - led by Alex Lockwood 

Sikh-ing Understanding: expressions of 1984 - led by Dr Jasjit Singh 

The Angry Brigade: service veterans and the Aden conflict - Led by Community Co-I Colin Hutchinson with Dr Limon and Alex Lockwood</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A range of groups and individuals from non-academic communities will benefit from (co)creating, and engaging with this project. This includes the people in the engaged communities, representatives from public services and policy makers, community artists, those concerned with community development and members of the public. Each research activity engages with a specific community through creative consultation, facilitated conversation and public discussion. The following lists sets out the component elements of the project and the communities with which that project will engage.

 
&amp;quot;In Angry Tongues: creative practices of anger in politicised poetry, song writing and performance&amp;quot; - community leaders, political activists, members of political groups and performers such as The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, The Miners List, and the union, Unite.

&amp;quot;Performing Rage: young women and their expression of anger&amp;quot; - young women and girls, librarians, teachers, social workers, youth leaders, and representatives of the social justice network convened by Newcastle University. The holders of the archive, Open Clasp, will also benefit by engaging with material that they have not seen as an 'archive' as asset with the capacity to support new work.

&amp;quot;Narrating Injustice Artfully: how anger towards animal cruelty and species loss is enacted and told through story&amp;quot; - Members of the animal and eco-activist communities in the UK and USA who are looking for effective methods of non-violent protest. Creative writers and visual artists who are seeking to engage with anger and rage in their own work. 

&amp;quot;Sikh-ing Understanding: expressions of 1984&amp;quot; - participants and audience at Saffron Mic, an annual Sikh community event in London. Dr Singhs participation in this event will be filmed and the work will be presented at the project's final community event in Newcastle.

&amp;quot;The Angry Brigade: service veterans and the Aden conflict&amp;quot; - British Service Veterans, and the network of veteran support agencies linked with Forward-Assist. This includes other veterans charities in the UK and abroad, policy makers, social support services and organisations concerned with social justice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33655</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A young designer was asked to create an image (logo) for (r)agency based on her understanding and research of the contemporary social construction of and discourse around &amp;quot;rage&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>910EA069-5F5D-48AE-9F41-C66186B9A75B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The young designer felt that her professional practice had been developed as a result of engaging with the ideas around rage and the requirement to respond to such an ambiguous prompt.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56af7b0337a5c8.71083712</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>logo design (r)agency</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://ragencyproject.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A collection of seven short stories about creatural lives.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8AC3E8D8-328E-4748-9BF8-17AE67ED428A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none recorded to date</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56af4f96d60417.31898004</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Seven human-animal stories</gtr:title><gtr:type>Creative Writing</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://zoomorphic.net</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Seven digital self-portraits plus text by young women participating the (r)agency project reflecting on their feelings about rage and anger</gtr:description><gtr:id>E8E3805A-B3E6-407F-9EE8-5F2346920F9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Change in feelings and capacity to reflect and talk about their own anger</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56af52a9724634.92516012</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Angry Young Women photographic exhibition</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ncla</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A small group of young Sikh artists in conversations with Dr Jasjit Singh talk about how their anger has provided the material and motivation for their creative work.

The findings from the work with veterans has led to a change in the status of the community co-investigating organisation, Forward-Assist who have won a national award from the Centre for Social Justice for their work and are now members of a national partnership of service providers to military veterans. They are developing gender-specific services for female ex-service personnel together with the PI for this project, Helen Limon. An application to the AHRC for research activity underpinning the development of this new service in in preparation. 
This is verbatim from the community Co-I Colin Hutchinson from Forward-Assist:

'Forward Assist veterans engaged fully with the Illustrated Soldier Project. The 'book hack' involved veterans from the Navy, Army and RAF looking at the portrayal of the military in Children's Picture Books. The books included The Conquerors by David McKee, A Child's Garden: A Story of Hope by Michael Foreman and The Enemy by Davide Cali, Serge Bloch as well as a range of sticker books portraying the military. 


The veterans were enthused that their opinions in regard to how the military was depicted in the books, was given a voice. The views and opinions were forthright and it was also enlightening as each book brought forward real stories of how they coped and reacted to deployment on operations throughout their military careers. Opinions were divided about each of the books but the facilitation of each session enabled all opinions to be heard. 


The book that divided opinion the most was A Child's Garden of Hope but the frank views expressed about the book enabled Debbie Beeks from Seven Stories to re-evaluate her thoughts on a children's book that she had used extensively in her work with children. 


At times during the sessions the stories brought forward through reflection on each of the books were cathartic for each of the veterans taking part as they developed a rapport that enabled them to share their experiences in a safe environment. 


Throughout the project the veterans also found it enlightening to be introduced to Seven Stories and as some are absent parents it gave them an opportunity to engage with the Centre along with their children. 


Forward Assist was delighted to be engaged in the project and the recordings and animations made as a result of the project were gratefully received. We look forward to screening the animations for all that took part at a later date. The delivery of our findings at The NAWE Conference was also a privilege to be part of as the voice of the veteran was also heard by an audience which would not necessarily engage with veteran opinions. 


The major change that has occurred through the project is that veterans have been able to express an opinion and had the opportunity to engage with two organisations; Newcastle University and Seven Stories that they would otherwise not have had the opportunity to work with or indeed think about working with. This may seem trivial to the outside world but when living in a hostel style environment it has enabled the veterans to look at where they are and reassess what hostel style environment it has enabled the veterans to look at where they are and reassess what they want to do to move on.
