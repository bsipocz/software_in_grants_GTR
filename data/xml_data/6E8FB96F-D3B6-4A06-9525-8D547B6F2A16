This is due in part to the variety of governance structures; for example, amongst other possibilities, museums may exist as a company or charitable trust, or both, or may be under local authority control. Objects in the collection may be on loan, or they may be held on trust, or owned by a company, or by a local authority. Furthermore, whereas special legislation applies to national museums, different statutory sources need to be considered in relation to local authorities. Yet there is no book covering both law and museum ethics to help guide museums in relation to the management of their collections. 

Museums strive to maintain public trust and confidence in a challenging financial climate and the need for information to assist them in arriving at informed judgments has never been stronger. 

The results of this project will include, amongst other outputs, a book discussing how legal and ethical principles apply to museum collections, and a Report on the Legal Status of Museum Collections. The book will make a unique and scholarly contribution to the fields of law, museum studies and cultural studies.

The book will provide information and practical advice for museums. A number of public bodies in the museum and charity sector have expressed strong support for this work and I will consult these bodies, and others, as this work progresses. I will provide opportunities for professionals to raise issues which concern them, such as by participating in the Museums Association's annual conference and at other national and regional conferences and workshops. This level of consultation will ensure that the contents of my outputs remain relevant. 

Museums currently have insufficient guidance on a number of topics. For example, many museums possess items which were collected in the past but where no record exists in relation to their acquisition. This is a problem which has created immense difficulties for museums. The book will address these pressing concerns, providing legal and ethical guidance for curators, managers and governing bodies. In this context, it will explore the possibilities for law reform, examining recommendations made by the Scottish Law Commission and considering the potential for a more limited legislative reform for all museums in the UK. 

In a fast-changing world, museums are expected to develop new strategies to enhance public access to their collections. This research will therefore cover legal and ethical issues relating to art loans, providing guidance and discussing pitfalls. It will also provide impartial information relating to legal structures. For example, charitable status may offer independence, financial advantages, and better protection to the collection. The recent court decision involving the Wedgwood Museum Collection has highlighted the risks involved where a public collection is affected by a company insolvency. The decision demonstrates how important it is to disseminate information about the law to ensure that there is responsible decision making. 

Although this project is ambitious in scope and addresses entirely underresearched areas, it is manageable because it builds upon my accumulated expertise. I acquired knowledge relating to deaccessioning and sale of objects from museum collections, together with experience of working with public sector bodies, during the course of a 50% AHRC Placement Fellowship. I have written on the law relating to acquisition of cultural items by museums in a book discussing strategic measures to combat the illicit trade in art and antiquities. Some matters, such as the law relating to insolvency and corporate governance, involve drawing on expertise gathered when I wrote a substantial book on the law of commercial fraud. However, the outputs from this new project will also involve a close examination of museum ethics and how these principles interact with the law.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Various bodies in the museum sector, as well as the Charity Commission, were involved in the preparation of a 32 page booklet entitled Report on the Legal Status of Museums Collections in the United Kingdom. It was edited by Jeremy Warren at the Museums and Galleries Commission, and published in 1996. Although museums have relied upon this Report in the past, it is now out of date. The museum sector and public bodies need a new Report, which takes account of recent legislation and other changes in law and practice, and which has a wider scope to include not only company, charity and trust law but also linked issues relating to ownership and good governance. One output from this project will be a new Report on the Legal Status of Museum Collections. The Museums Association (&amp;quot;MA&amp;quot;), the Arts Council and the Collections Trust are keen to provide input as I progress. The Report can be made available for any museum to freely download, or any other interested person, from websites such as those run by the MA and the Collections Trust. 

However, museums and public sector bodies need more than a brief summary of key elements of the law relating to museum collections. This project will therefore include the production of a book which explains how the law applies in particular situations. Using the electronic discussion forum on the MA's website, or taking advantage of regional meetings of the MA and other public bodies, or consulting individual museums, I can collect a series of hypothetical case studies to use in the book. As the royalties will be paid to the MA, museums will have an incentive for engaging in dialogue and contributing ideas. I hope that they will see the book as &amp;quot;their&amp;quot; book in the sense that they will have influenced its direction and content. 

As ethical principles play such an important role in museum practice, the book will disentangle legal principles from ethical ones, subjecting them both to equal scrutiny, and discussing how both would apply in particular situations. As a consequence, the book and other outputs should have a provocative effect in stimulating debate in relation to law and museum ethics within the museum sector.

The wide-ranging nature of this project, covering many different areas of law and their relationship with ethical principles, means that I will be in a position to respond to new issues as they arise. For example, I am discussing with the MA whether we could have a Question and Answer session on legal and ethical issues surrounding collections at their annual conference. I could sit on a panel of experts and we can solicit questions in advance via Twitter as well as during the session. The wide and ambitious scope of the project provides a great impetus for running and participating in conferences, seminars and workshops. For example, I will be running a two day conference on Vulnerability and Cultural Heritage on 9 and 10 May 2013 with a specific focus upon strategic measures to combat heritage crime. The conference will draw a number of interested people together, including not only academics from abroad, but also representatives from the museum sector and charities such as English Heritage. I plan to run a conference and workshops in 2014, bringing museums, public sector bodies and academics together to discuss specific issues. These debates will be part of a process of enhancing knowledge and understanding of the principles and values which do or should guide museums in dealing with their collections. 

This project will be helpful to international networks such as the International Council of Museums and the Network of European Museum Organisations as well as museums overseas, which often need to grapple with the same problems as their UK counterparts. This pioneering research will put the UK at the leading edge in museum practice. and may stimulate similar initiatives by academics overseas, thereby benefiting museums in other countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>131273</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Heritage Lottery Fund</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Curatorially motivated disposals and guidance on closures of museums</gtr:description><gtr:id>D8DEAD30-4A4B-4659-8405-35C08BB0E1F1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The guidance will be published in May 2017 and is expected to have a significant impact in the museum sector.

In particular, we discussed our concerns about disposals of objects which had originated from abroad, such as the Middle East.
If the disposal of an object is by way of a transfer to another museum, there is usually no difficulty. However, if there is a proposal by a museum to sell an object it may become highly controversial, taking up the time of various public bodies (such as the Arts Council England and the Art and Antiques Unit of the Metropolitan Police). It is therefore important to formulate guidance in a way which encourages museums to reflect and to conduct themselves with care.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have only had one lengthy formal meeting with the Head of the Art and Antiques Unit of the Metropolitan Police, in 2014.

I have had several lengthy meetings at the London offices of Arts Council England with Scott Furlong, Director of Collections and Cultural Property, early on in my AHRC Leadership Fellowship, to discuss what needed to be included in the pdf guidance for the museum sector. We have kept in touch since then by e-mail, telephone and by conversations at conferences. 
I have supplied Scott Furlong and Isabel Wilson with a number of articles which I have written and which we have discussed. On the basis of these publications, we have discussed legislation in two areas in particular:
(1) altering the status of local authority museum collections so that their status is charitable to ensure that any sales are well considered and acceptable to the sector. This recommendation is linked to my ESRC 50% Placement Fellowship (Ethical and Legal Aspects of Sales from Museum Collections)
(2) enabling accredited museums to acquire legal title to objects in their collections where there is uncertainty over ownership (orphan collections, deposited objects, and uncollected loans). This recommendation is linked to my AHRC Award (the Status of Museum Collections).
I am currently discussing both law proposals with the DCMS and the English and Scottish Law Commissions

Isabel Wilson from ACE and I are part of a team engaged in drafting ethical and legal guidance which will be published in May 2017 which will assist the governing bodies of museums facing closure. This further project is based upon research carried out as part of my AHRC Award (the Status of Museum Collections).

The article recommends that accredited museums should be able to acquire legal title to objects in their collections where the ownership is uncertain. We discussed the proposal for law reform in detail in 2016 before I contacted the Law Commission for England and Wales. This law proposal, if enacted, would save museums money and help to make them more sustainable.

Although I was well aware of the risks which reckless metal detecting posed to our heritage, I was pleased to learn more. Equally, it was very interesting to hear more about the role of enforcement agencies in different countries and their ability to confiscate objects which had been illicitly imported (as this is a particular risk for museums which purchase without carrying out sufficient due diligence).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5450bf1f7b36e1.50602346</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of a paper on professional codes of ethics at a conference on &quot;Risk Management in the Art and Antiquities Market.&quot; at K&amp;L Gates LLP solicitors</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9FE65475-D64E-462C-BA47-7A5DA9666716</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I provided a talk regarding &amp;quot;Professional codes of ethics, combating the illicit trade in art and antiquities, and new regulatory challenges on the horizon.&amp;quot;.The conference was entitled, &amp;quot;Risk Management in the Art and Antiquities Market.&amp;quot; The conference was held at a firm of solicitors, K&amp;amp;L Gates LLP on 7 February 2017.

This was a particularly valuable session because of the discussion which followed. Up until this point, it had not occurred to me that museums would expect guidance on situations where an object had been deposited on loan and had not been collected at the end of the loan.

I explained that my new draft guidance would also include acquisitions as well as disposals. A museum professional reported that the governing body of her museum contacted the local police when a family, whose father had died, had offered to donate his religious artefacts to the museum. The museum suspected that the artefacts had been smuggled into the country. She reported that the police were very heavy handed, visiting the family in a very public way, so that the visit drew attention to them. It was featured in the local paper. The way it was handled damaged the reputation of the museum unfortunately.

The workshop was organised by UCL in response to demands from members of two &amp;quot;action groups&amp;quot; who had worked to challenge local authority decisions to sell objects from their museums' collections. The action groups consisted of ordinary members of the public, who were concerned to challenge Northampton Borough Council's sale of the Sekhemka statue and Croydon Council's sale of ceramics. These action groups were keen to have an interdisciplinary workshop where the law and ethics and other matters could be discussed because they had felt that public bodies, such as the Arts Council, should have done more to prevent these sales. A representative from the Arts Council was present to provide that organisation's view and I was involved to help these people understand the law. 
During 2014 and 2015, I had helped the Sekhemka action group by explaining legal terms to them so that they could understand the process. Even so, I was careful to remain impartial in the same way as the Arts Council and the Museums Association. It was important to remain neutral in a complex situation where local residents were in conflict with their local authority. In the end, Northampton Borough Council's museums were stripped of their accreditation by the Arts Council due to the sale of the Sekhemka statue: the sale was declared unethical and in breach of the Museums Association's Code of Ethics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9e40807f0a9.12319943</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Esm?e Fairbairn Collections Fund Network Day, London.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E412AEF9-9966-44BF-A0E2-BD7752119911</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented a paper on 'Disposals: Ethics and the Law' at the Esm&amp;eacute;e Fairbairn Collections Fund Network Day, London, in 28 March.

I was the only lawyer and I was asked questions on museum ethics. Ironically, a previous speaker was an expert on museum ethics and was asked questions on the law.

This would be another example of a Leadership activity, where I was invited to participate as one of the country's experts on the protection of cultural property.

I revised the booklet in 2016 in response to changes in the law and is now 59 pages long. The booklet is available on the Museums Association's website.

I have explained the current law and argued in favour of law reform.
1) New legislation allowing accredited museums to acquire legal title to objects in their collections where ownership is uncertain. &amp;quot;Frozen in Time: Orphans and Uncollected Objects in Museum Collections&amp;quot; International Journal of Cultural Property (2017) 24, 1-28. 
2) New legislation providing that local authority museum collections should be held on charitable trusts. My publications not only cover this issue but also provide a background context: 'The Sale of Items in Museum Collections' chapter 11 in N. Hopkins (ed), Modern Studies in Property Law, Volume 7 (2013, Oxford: Hart Publishing), 217-241; &amp;quot;Dealing with UK Museum Collections: Law, Ethics and the Public/Private Divide&amp;quot; International Journal of Cultural Property (2015) 22, 177-204.
The Law Commission has asked for copies of all my publications, including my pdf. booklet, in order to enable them to take instructions from the DCMS to change the law. 
There is no other law academic writing in this field. One can truly say that the support of the funding bodies is transforming this area of law.

I have been told by one DCMS official at the Museums Association's annual conference that, in the light of the research which I have carried out as an AHRC Fellow may mean that the DCMS can proceed directly towards instructing Parliamentary Counsel in relation to the first piece of proposed legislation. In other words, my AHRC supported research, together with work carried out by the Scottish Law Commission, may be sufficient, without the expense of involving the English Law Commission. 
I have told the DCMS that, in my view, the English Law Commission should be involved in relation to the second proposal. This is because there is more research which could be done (which would have been well outside the scope of my 50% Placement Fellowship) in relation to local government legislation. There is no special legislation governing museums and cultural objects and I would suggest that there should be.. 

These proposed changes in the law were discussed at a meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cultural Heritage at Westminster on 8 February 2017. There was time to discuss the first proposal (relating to legal title) properly and there was unanimous support for the proposal. A member of the DCMS (Lisa Ollerhead) attended the meeting and I have kept in contact with her since. We ran out of time and could not discuss the second proposal on local government collections in sufficient detail: it will be discussed at a later meeting this year.

I am part of a team engaged in drafting ethical and legal guidance which will be published in May 2017 which will assist the governing bodies of museums facing closure.This further project is based upon research carried out as part of my AHRC Award (the Status of Museum Collections).

I am currently consulting the museum sector about these proposed changes in the law at conferences. I pass back my findings to the English and Scottish Law Commissions (Property Sections) and the DCMS.
As part of my application for an AHRC Fellowship, I promised to be a &amp;quot;bridge builder.&amp;quot; I am engaged in doing precisely this, liaising between different public bodies and ensuring that everyone is being kept informed. For example, I have contacted the Charity Commission in relation to the proposal that local authority collections should enjoy charitable status.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>44493C96-4D8D-4A82-A947-0E993C554C89</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e07544497e62.57225794</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I consider that the UK needs legislation:
1) Legislation which enables museums to become owners of objects in their collections which they have had in their possession for many years but where either ownership is unknown (due to lack of acquisition records) or where the loan was for an indeterminate period of time and the owner cannot be found. 
2) Legislation which would restrict sales of objects from local authority collections to prevent irrational and reckless sales. I have suggested that local authorities should hold accessioned collections on charitable trusts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I have provided the museum sector with a lengthy pdf. booklet which is freely available and which provides detailed explanations on the law in relation to key points on which many people were uncertain. For example, one common problem for many museums has been the receipt of a claim for an object's return long after that object has been donated; typically, they receive a letter from a relative who alleges that the benefactor only gave the object on loan and that they want it returned now that the benefactor has died. I have been told by museum professionals that the booklet gives them confidence in dealing with such claims. 
As promised in my application, my guidance is written in a style which museum professionals can understand. However, it does have copious footnotes because some of the areas covered are not well understood by solicitors. The booklet provides a bridge between museum professionals and solicitors and barristers.
I have answered many questions in my booklet and publications which have not been covered in any law book. I have been involved in numerous engagement activities, and also informally discussed problems with museum people, since receiving the AHRC Leadership Award. The booklet has become increasingly important in providing guidance regarding the status of collections where museums are facing closure. For example, I had a lengthy meeting with a councillor, a legal representative and museum professionals at Lancashire C.C. in August 2016 to discuss their planned closure of 5 museums. My pdf guidance on curatorially motivated disposals was referred to at various points. I am involved in a working group to provide guidance to governing bodies of museums facing closure. Members of the working group were told that my involvement and the guidance was seen as invaluable because Lancashire CC is trying to follow best practice in carrying out these closures. 
My work as an AHRC Leadership Fellow has transformed people's lives making both museum professionals and public bodies more self-assured. It has meant that the public bodies can identify more accurately where law reform is needed. The DCMS carried out a Museum Review towards the end of 2016 and my work has meant that bodies such as Arts Council England and the Museums Association are in a better position to call for new legislation to deal with objects where legal title is uncertain and new legislation in relation to the status of local authority collections.
I am currently carrying out engagements where I discuss law reform. As soon as I have made my submission to ResearchFish, I will be drawing up a document to provide feedback from a conference presentation which I carried out on 10 March 2017. It will be sent to various bodies: the DCMS, the Law Commission, the Scottish Law Commission, the Scottish equivalent of the DCMS, the Museums Association, the Arts Council and the Collections Trust. I have two more booked engagements where I will be carrying out this type of consultation but I envisage that far more will be carried out during the course of this year. This consultation involves an immense amount of hard work. It might be that the DCMS eventually instructs the Law Commission to carry out this work instead of me (I know that they will be having a meeting later this month about law reform for the museum sector). If so, I will check with the Law Commission to find out how I can help them further. In summary, I have such an extensive expertise in this field now that I think it is appropriate to help any public body which needs that special expertise. 
I also plan to continue publishing in the area of cultural property. I have two Ph.D. students who are carrying out research in relation to museum collections and disposals and I have been responsible for two visitng Ph.D. students researching collections. I examined a Ph.D. student at the University of Aberystwyth in 2016 on cultural property (indigenous rights) and I will be acting as an examiner this year for a Ph.D. student at King's College London (illicit trade in cultural property). I co-run the Art, Culture and Heritage stream at the Socio-Legal Studies Association's annual conference. 
In summary, I intend to continue supporting and encouraging students and academics to carry out interdisciplinary research in the heritage sector. At the same time, I plan to consult and listen to public bodies in the museum sector in areas where I can be helpful.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9E4A4C38-5D35-4AA4-AB4C-A02E757C74E8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e07e6c55e806.18662002</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in discussions of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cultural Heritage at the Palace of Westminster</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>35C1050A-A12B-49C3-ADE6-6652FD6215B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have been attending the meetings of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cultural Heritage since 2016.

A representative from the DCMS was present and we discussed the proposal further at the end of the meeting.
We also briefly discussed another proposal relating to the ethical and legal aspects of sales from museum collections (which was the subject of my ESRC/AHRC Placement Fellowship).
