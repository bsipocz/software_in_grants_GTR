To support these impacts, the project includes a proactive outreach programme, designed to highlight the biophysical environment as a fundamental determinant of health, and one critically affected by environmental and health-related behaviours. The main focus of the impact activities will be non-academic and, specifically, the UK policy community. 

The impact activities will be coordinated on a day-to-day basis by Saskia Walcott and Susannah Randall, of Walcott Communications, who have extensive expertise in communicating social and health research to wider audiences. This includes working with the Wellcome Trust and the ESRC.

We will deliver a programme of presentations at health conferences/events at national and regional level (e.g. Midlands and south of England) to take advantage of the major policy shift of NHS responsibility to local authorities in April 2013. We will make use of the press and social media, together with mobile displays, articles in professional magazines and a commissioned film, to ensure two-way knowledge transfer with practitioners and other stakeholders groups and - importantly - win public support for joint approaches to population-ecosystem health to promote the health of future generations. These will be targeted at socio-demographic and policy groups with heightened sensitivity to children's health futures, and faciliated by the project's research and policy leaders groups. 

Finally, we will exploit the academic relevance of the work by publishing in a broad range of peer-reviewed papers aimed at social and health scientists (e.g. British Medical Journal, Sociology of Health and Illness, Social Science and Medicine, Health Policy) and ecosystem scientists (Ecosystem Services, Environmental Health, Environmental Health Perspectives, EcoHealth), as well as taking opportunities to present our work at relevant international conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199271</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>presenter at 'Natural Capital &amp; Health' session of Natural Capital Initiative conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8230CE6B-96DC-4A6D-A38F-46E9FCB6D902</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk sparked questions and discussions afterwards.

The meeting drew on the 2014 IPCC report and considered how to communicate the health implications for environmental and health professionals. It involved over 30 experts and representatives from European countries who gathered to examine and communicate the health implications of the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

In the main, the two communities operate separately, with joint working led by a small handful of policy leaders who work across the health/environment interface. 

Impact has therefore required building and strengthening pathways between the two communities. The HOPE project has supported the development of these pathways by focusing its research on issues that connect directly to both health and environmental policy. 

Examples include:

1. Our research on inter-generational time preferences and, in particular, our study of the relative weight that UK adults give to policies to protect current and future generations. 

This work has been directly informed by policy leaders working across health and the environment, including via the project's Policy Leaders Advisory Group. Under their guidance, we have investigated inter-generational time preferences in Britain relating to health policies (saving lives) and environmental policies (flood protection) [3, 4]. This approach was chosen because it connects to the use of discounting in the economic evaluation of policy options (a key issue for health policy leaders) and around linking environmental and climate change policy to people's shared values (a key issue for environmental policy leaders). 

We have been able to feed our findings into a range of policy events, including an invited Dept of Health/Dept of Climate Change meeting (2013), an invited WHO meeting (2014) and a webinar for the Environment Agency (2015). Our findings have also informed inputs to the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change (5) and the Commission's 'Countdown to 2030' (6), where Hilary Graham is co-leading monitoring of public opinion and policy. In discussion with policy leaders, the HOPE team has been extended to investigate people's willingness to pay for policies to protect future generations, again through a dual public health/environment focus (this time heat deaths related to climate change). The survey and analysis are complete. Findings have been fed back to the climate change lead at the Dept of Health and we are currently preparing a journal paper.

2. Our work on behaviours which impact on both individual health and the environment. 

Again, policy interest has been a major driver of this work. Across the health, environment and climate change fields, there is growing policy interest in behaviours with potential for health and environmental 'co-benefits'; there are, however, few studies which have investigated the patterning of these behaviours. Informed by our review of studies with evidence on both sets of behaviours [7], we worked with the Director of the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Environmental Change &amp;amp; Health to run a workshop that brought environmental and health researchers in dialogue with policy advisors, representatives from research funding bodies and those with oversight of key UK's data sources [8]. 

This event made clear that the UK data infrastructure offers exciting opportunities for analyses to inform policies to promote sustainable healthy lifestyles, including co-benefit behaviours [8]. Working with policy and research experts, we have developed a searchable e-resource of UK data sources that contains measures of environmental and health behaviours [9]. We have also secured research funding from the DH Public Health Research Consortium (DH Policy Research Programme) for a review of evidence from qualitative studies on the influences on travel behaviours with health and environmental impacts [10].

Does the public prefer policies bringing greater benefits to them than to future generations? (paper in preparation)

Background: Standard policy evaluations, including those by NICE, are based on the assumption that people prefer policies bringing immediate benefits to them to ones bringing longer-term benefits to future generations. In economic parlance, they 'discount' the future. We found very little evidence to support this assumption. We therefore tested it in surveys (2013-15) of the British public; we asked people about policies to save lives and to protect against disastrous flooding. 
Key findings: When asked to choose between policies bringing unequal benefits across theirs, their children's and their grandchildren's generation, only a minority chose the policy that most advantaged their generation. The majority chose a policy bringing equal or greater benefit to future generations. Patterns were similar for both policies.
If confirmed by other studies, the finding raises important questions about standard policy evaluation. It suggests that discounting practices may not accord with public preferences: our study indicates that people have a strong antipathy to benefiting current over future generations and a strong preference for policies that benefited their children and grandchildren more. 

2. Can an ecosystem services approach provide a way of integrating research and policy on the natural environment and human health? (paper under review)

Background: Environmental change is undermining the conditions for people's health. Ways of working across science and policy are urgently required. An ecosystem services (ES) approach could provide this bridge. Increasingly used in environmental research and policy, it focuses on the benefits ('ecosystem services'), including health, that people obtain from the natural environment. We searched for ES frameworks using standard search procedures and assessed how the frameworks represented the drivers of and links between ecosystem and human health.
Key findings: Of the 84 frameworks we identified, the large majority did not include human health, human/ecosystem health feedback mechanisms or time. We are currently reviewing the health frameworks used by the public health research and policy community before refining an integrated framework for ecosystem and human health that can inform 'joined up' research and policies on environmental change and public health.


3. What are the patterns of active travel in rural and urban communities in the UK? (paper published)

Background: Undertaking short journeys on foot or by bicycle ('active travel' - AT) can provide health and environmental co-benefits. However, the poorer transport infrastructure in rural areas, together with fewer amenities within walking distance, creates barriers to AT for rural communities. We investigated rural/urban patterns of AT using the UK Household Longitudinal Survey. 
Key findings: We confirmed that AT is less common among rural residents (33%) than urban residents (46%). It was also less socially patterned. In both rural and urban communities, the odds of AT were higher among young adults, men, those without full-time employment and with a lower income. In addition for urban residents, those with a degree and without children were more likely to travel actively.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Finding 1 (the British public express a strong preference for policies that benefit future generations - a finding contrary to assumptions built into standard economic evaluation). The project's Policy Leaders Group - which includes members in senior positions in NICE, Dept of Health, Environment Agency, Natural England etc - recognised the importance of these findings. While preliminary at this stage, they are directly relevant to policies to secure environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation, where urgent action is needed now to secure benefits for future generations. 

Finding 2 (human health and time are poorly represented in frameworks expressly designed to capture the human benefits of ecosystem services). This finding will help inform the selection of appropriate frameworks by those working across public health and environmental protection/sustainability. Frameworks play an important role in building common understandings and approaches across policy sectors. 

Finding 3 (patterns of active travel vary between rural and urban communities). This finding can be taken forward by local and regional agencies seeking to promote active travel for health and/or environmental reasons. While the majority of UK live in urban areas, the distinctive patterns of active travel in rural areas points to the need for separate strategies to support walking and cycling in rural communities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>63E2C7FB-5870-4C52-97FB-64E64110F30D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>554cab3c85e8f6.22435532</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/research/public-health/projects/hope/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>THE DATABASE
It is increasingly recognised that the lifestyle factors responsible for the major burden of ill-health, nationally and globally, are also ones which are damaging the environment. 

However, behaviours that affect health and behaviours with environmental impacts are the focus of separate research and policy fields, each with its own community, perspectives, priorities and data sets. This separation makes it hard to build up an evidence base on behaviours with the potential to both improve health and protect the environment (for example, switching from a high to a low-meat diet and switching from commuting by car to commuting by bicycle).

A workshop was organised in autumn 2015 to bring together researchers and policy makers across public health and the environment. The workshop agreed that a unified database of UK datasets with information on health behaviours and environmental behaviours was an important resource. It would improve the evidence base and aid policy linkages across public health, environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation.

As a result, a database has been developed, building on data sources suggested by workshop attendees. The database:

? contains more than 30 datasets with information on health and environmental behaviours
? provides information on survey and sampling methodology and population coverage, both socio-demographic and geographic. 
? includes search functionality, enabling users to quickly identify suitable datasets to inform current and future projects and interventions

SEARCH AND SCREENING FUNCTIONALITY

Users can identify candidate datasets by filtering against the following criteria:

? Type of survey: longitudinal or cross sectional
? Year of most recent data 
? Sample size
? Inclusion of adults and/or children
? Presence of an ethnic minority boost in the sampling strategy
? Geographical coverage: UK; Britain; England; Wales; Scotland; Northern Ireland
? Health behaviours: smoking; alcohol consumption; physical activity; diet
? Environmental behaviours: commuting; other travel; diet; greenspace use; other

In addition, supplementary information is provided for each dataset to help users determine its potential usefulness:

? Full date range covered
? Sampling methodology, e.g. household or individual
? Frequency of surveys for longitudinal studies
?
