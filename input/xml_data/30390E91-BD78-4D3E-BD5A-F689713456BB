Once it has spread, it is very hard to treat and even with newly licenced treatments the long-term outlook is poor. One of the most promising new treatments is adoptive cell therapy (ACT). This uses the patient's own immune cells as a treatment. Immune cells that can recognise and destroy the cancer are found within the tumour itself (tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and can be isolated from a sample removed by surgery. These cells are expanded in a laboratory under carefully controlled conditions to increase their number. Around 10,000 million cells are given to patients along with chemotherapy and interleukin-2 (IL2). Preliminary studies indicate that this treatment is very successful in shrinking and controlling tumours for long durations. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of this treatment and the need for IL2. IL2 adds to the side effects of treatment and it is uncertain if such high doses are needed. This trial will determine if a lower dose is as effective but reduces the side effects of the therapy. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive the cells with either high dose IL2 (HD-IL2) or low dose IL2 (LD-IL2). In total, up to 90 patients will enter the study with up to 45 in each arm. The trial will focus on how frequently the treatment results in tumour shrinkage, but will also look at how long the tumour is controlled and how long patients live. It is anticipated that the treatment will produce tumour responses in 40% of patients and that in many the benefits will be long lasting. It is also hoped that the trial will suggest that LD IL2 will be of similar effectiveness to HD IL2 but have less side effects. The optimal regimen will be used in future trials and potentially become a standard treatment. Specialist expertise and facilities for the manufacture and administration of this treatment are already operational in Manchester. The cost of therapy is substantial but it is a one-off, short-term treatment and it appears to benefit a large proportion of patients and to provide long term benefits and so overall it is cost effective. The research will also undertake laboratory analysis to try to identify patients who are more or less likely to benefit from therapy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Research design: A propose a randomised phase II trial with two parallel arms to evaluate the efficacy of standard TIL therapy with HD-IL2 or with LD-IL2. Study population: Patients must have confirmed malignant melanoma which is refractory to standard therapy. They must have a metastatic lesion which can be excised to produce an adequate specimen to culture the TIL. Planned interventions: Both arms of the trial will include TIL with standard pre-conditioning. The control arm will include standard HD-IL2 at a dose of 600,000U/Kg. The patients randomised to the LD-IL2 arm will receive 100,000U/Kg. Proposed outcome measures: The primary objective is to establish feasibility and tolerability of TIL therapy and the RECIST response rate to TIL therapy with both standard HD-IL2 and LD-IL2 and to confirm that the response rate is likely to be greater than 20%. Secondary objectives: To include the evaluation of the duration of remission in both arms, the overall survival in both arms and the examination of toxicity and cost in relation to benefit. We will also explore potential tumour related or immunological biomarkers of response to facilitate better patient selection in the future. Assessment and Follow up: During admission the patients will be carefully and intensively monitored. After discharge the patients will be assessed clinically at least 2-weekly for until 6 weeks, then monthly for six months and then three monthly. They will have disease assessment by CT scans at 6 weeks, 3 months and then 3 monthly. They will be followed for toxicity until progression and for survival thereafter. Proposed sample size and Statistical analysis: The study design is for two parallel Simon 2-stage studies, one for LD-IL2 and one for HD-IL2. Patients will be randomised to either arm - each arm will have 24 patients in the first stage and if there are at least 6 responses then 21 further patients will be recruited to that arm (there will be a minimum of 2x24=48 patients and a maximum of 2x45=90 patients). The study design regards a response rate of &amp;lt; 20% to be not worthy of further consideration. After the second stage if there are more than 13 responses out of the 45 cases in an arm, that arm will be considered worthy of further consideration. If both arms meet this criterion then their respective response rate estimates will be weighed against toxicity to decide on the ?best candidate? for further study. Project timetables including recruitment rate: We anticipate the study can commence July 2013. All the processes are in place but full approval by MHRA/Ethics and institutions will be required. The recruitment rate will rapidly increase to 2-3 per month and we anticipate recruitment to be 12, 24, 24, 24, 6 in successive years. This will leave time for completion of all clinical and laboratory analyses within 60 months.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>111710</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Many patients were aware of the trial and it is a great shame that the excess treatment costs issues could not be solved.
