The media frenzy surrounding NDiaye's prize and its apparent significance (she is the first 'black' woman to receive the Goncourt) was exacerbated both by her polemical remarks regarding the 'monstrous' nature of Sarkozy's France and by her self-imposed exile to Berlin. While her spat with the Elysee and its gleeful reporting might seem, at first glance, indicative of no more than a slow week for news, they can, in fact, be theorized as a crass symptom of the complex cultural position this singular writer has quietly occupied ever since the publication of her first novel, aged eighteen, in 1985. Much of the confusion emerging in the public arena around the increasingly visible NDiaye resides in the thorny question of how to understand her place on the French literary scene. She is frequently evoked by critics, journalists, and even politicians, as simultaneously troubling/troublesome 'foreign body' _and_ as resplendent, Frencher-than-French genius (in 2003 she became only the second woman playwright whose work entered the repertory of the Comedie-Francaise). This maddening cultural paradox is precisely what her fiction and theatre have been grappling with for two and a half decades. This monograph will be the first full-length study in English devoted to Marie NDiaye and her remarkable corpus (ten novels; seven plays; one collection of short stories; three children's books; and a co-authored film screenplay). It structures readings of NDiaye's work around the author's repeated representations of monstrous cultural situations in which (often unspeakably) stigmatized characters find themselves compelled to undergo a series of (often barely representable) transformations, in order to secure an unattainable guarantee of acceptability and integration. Always unequal, in the final analysis, to the nightmarish challenge of institutional legitimation, the subjects in question will (often literally) come apart at the seams, their would-be-ameliorative displacements and modifications proven (at best) only ever provisional. NDiaye's panoply of wretched heroines and heroes are, for the most part, quite powerless to prevent their own gradual erosion. She presents human transformation into ghoulish shadow (_En famille_, 1990), barely perceptible 'emanation' (_Un temps de saison_, 1994), and (less fantastically) death-bound migrant (_Trois femmes puissantes_, 2009). But, this book argues, the extremity of these metamorphoses in no way offers transgression or transcendence of the social processes of glorification, supremacy, humiliation and oppression of which they are the deranged symptom. NDiaye's writing removes every possibility of an oppositional or 'progressive' agency within the metamorphosis the subject experiences. The loss of human bodily contours is nothing more, NDiaye's texts often seem to suggest, than the world's final abuse of that body after a long series of terrifying over-exposures and over-determinations. This book attempts to address a number of literary and wider cultural questions regarding stigma, identity, realism, the fantastic, strangeness and the unspeakable. What might be the basis or justification of an ethico-political reading of NDiaye's oeuvre? To what extent do NDiaye's representations of metamorphosis as the corollary of social stigma develop a Kafkaesque aesthetic for the contemporary 'non-white' European subject? How does the reader of NDiaye avoid the twin traps of reading 'race' into everything or else ignoring it altogether? How might NDiaye's literary and theatrical work contribute to a robust postmodern ethics of self-reinvention? And how might we use the relentless 'negativity' ofNDiaye's depictions of a perpetually disintegrating subject in a 'positive' manner?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The monograph emerging from this research project, as well as the conference papers I shall be giving in the course of it (e.g. San Francisco, April 2011; Mannheim, June 2011) will benefit researchers working in the fields of French studies; literature; cinema; and theatre studies, as detailed in the Academic Beneficiaries section. However, given the work's focus on identity (specifically hybrid identity) and NDiaye's fantastical writing of metamorphosis as a possible 'response' to that identity and its potentially traumatic dimensions, the work will also benefit scholars researching wider questions of race, representation, society and psychology. NDiaye's brother, the increasingly visible French sociologist of race, Pap Ndiaye (sic), whose recent work _La Condition Noire_ (Paris, 2007) has broken new ground in France, does not come from a literary perspective, yet he will be speaking at the same conference in Mannheim as myself later this year. This is a demonstration of an exciting inter-penetration of literary and sociological approaches. If sociologists of race begin to interact with artists and literary theorists working on creative responses to racialized conditions, the potential for new breakthroughs in our understanding of complex identities and their possibilities both in art and in 'real life' will clearly be maximized. The research centre I co-direct, Birkbeck Research in Aesthetics of Kinship and Community (BRAKC, http://www.bbk.ac.uk/brrkc/) is dedicated to precisely this cross-fertilization of the arts and the social sciences, bringing together as it does different 'kinds' of experts in the configuration of families and groups, so that the perspectives of everyone involved in the dialogue can expand. I shall be presenting my research on NDiaye at BRAKC in the course of my proposed research leave (more details of my planned 2012 symposium in Pathways to Impact). Since the establishment of BRAKC (membership of which includes NDiaye scholars Prof Shirley Jordan and Dr Marie-Claire Barnet, who is also external examiner for the associated MA in Aesthetics of Kinship and Community, which I co-founded and co-direct at Birkbeck), I have consistently witnessed the direct interaction of scholars working on kinship and community (in literature, theatre or film) with people working at the heart of 'real' families or communities, and who have carried their communication with academics back to their 'hands on' activities. This takes place at the level of the symposia I organize (e.g. June 2011: 'Trans-Generational Trauma in Enslavement Narratives') but also my teaching, where my MA students, all of whom are involved in community work (from 'cared for' children centres to asylum seeker aid and advice), take their research at Birkbeck in kinship/community aesthetics (my emerging specialism) back with them to the street, as it were. The charities and care/advice organizations with which I am connected through Birkbeck students will thus benefit from my research on NDiaye, with its emphasis on mixed-race identity, multi-cultural kinship and its vicissitudes, psychological integration and disintegration, and creativity. I am able to disseminate that research via my teaching *and* the highly active BRAKC research centre, which is increasingly involved with 'the real world'. At our international conference in June 2011, 'Visions of the Coming Community', for example, not only will scholars working on theories and representations of community be involved in the two-day discussions, but so too will artists and care workers (e.g. Orly Orbach and Hannah Eaton), whose daily existence is devoted to the nurturing of children at the interface of different communities. The edited volume that will emerge from the conference will contribute directly to a greater understanding of the possibilities for interaction between scholars of community an</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62678</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I wrote a book, Marie NDiaye: Blankness and Recognition, which is the first critical study in English to focus exclusively on the work of Marie NDiaye, born in central France in 1967, winner of the Prix Femina (2001), the Prix Goncourt (2009), shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize (2013), and widely considered to be one of the most important French authors of her generation. In the book I argue that at the heart of NDiaye's world lurks an indefinable 'blankness' which makes it impossible for the reader to decode narrative at the level of psychology or event. NDiaye's texts explore social stigmata and familial disintegration with a violence unmatched by any of her contemporaries, but in doing so they remain as strangely affectless and 'unrecognizable' as their dissociated protagonists. Considering each of NDiaye's works in chronological order (including her novels, theatre, short fiction and writing for children), I assessed the aesthetic, emotional and political stakes of NDiaye's portraits of impenetrable selfhood. My book provides an original and provocative framework within which to read NDiaye as a simultaneously hybrid and hyper-French cultural figure, fascinating and fantastical practitioner of the postmodern - and reluctantly postcolonial - 'blank arts'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My book has resulted in a number of extremely positive reviews in both English and French, suggesting that my findings are being put to use by others. I include some extracts from English-language reviews below:

Prof Lydie Moudileno, University of Pennsylvania: 'Marie NDiaye: Blankness and Recognition is a beautifully written book, obviously inspired, with analysis which makes you want to read all of the work of NDiaye.' (French Review, 2016) 

Prof Shirley Jordan, Queen Mary University of London: 'Andrew Asibong's erudite and spirited book will be a landmark in studies of Marie NDiaye's writing. Asibong writes with verve, and with an involvement which is contagious. His book is the product of a fervent personal engagement with the unnerving cruelty of NDiaye's vision. He is courageous enough to let this surface in ways which serve only to strengthen the value of his study and the pleasure to be derived from it. It seems fitting that the first extended monograph on this major writer should offer such a sharply responsive account of her work, and that its own winning obsessiveness should match that of its subject.' (Modern Language Review, 2015)

Prof Dominic Thomas, UCLA: 'Andrew Asibong's &amp;quot;Marie NDiaye: Blankness and Recognition&amp;quot; is the authoritative study of one of France's most intriguing and pioneering contemporary authors, indeed of an author whose work compels us at every turn to rethink the ways in which identity, literature, and nationality have heretofore been conceptualized.'

Prof Michael Sheringham, the late Marshal Foch Professor of French, University of Oxford: 'A highly intelligent and distinguished book that will be seen as a milestone in the well-deserved critical recognition of a major
