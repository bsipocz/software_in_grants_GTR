In this project an integrated framework for improved performance of extrusion processes will be developed through advances in process modelling, inferential measurement and a more intelligent approach to control of the process. This will require the development of transparent on-line models integrating first-principles' models with analysis of observable on-line data. It will enable inferential measurement of key performance indicators; identification of process faults; on-line optimisation of settings; and an ability to self-tune to changing feed materials and conditions. The end result will be a novel methodology for extrusion control which will provide a comprehensive framework for accurate, efficient and flexible extrusion processing. Such a device would have a major impact on achieving higher product quality and greater potential of recycled feed material while reducing downtime, energy consumption and wastage of valuable polyolefin resources. In order to develop this system, pivotal research is required in a number of areas. These include new theory (development of novel modelling techniques; robust on-line system identification for feed material changes); innovative practical measurements (real time data acquisition and processing of high frequency signals) and innovative data analysis for interpretation of complex data (correlation of data with non-homogenous melting, identification of material degradation, integration in a robust, adaptive control strategy). The development of techniques in this research will also provide an ideal platform for achieving greater success in emerging complex processing applications, for example in reactive extrusion, micro-extrusion and compounding of nanocomposites.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>280831</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Consultancy work for GSK</gtr:description><gtr:id>99DB2790-1BC8-40C6-B029-D2D70ED57D8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Initial meetings and discussions have been made.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db1b0f2d6560.55292421-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>GSK will provide consultancy fee to the university.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The work on extrusion has attracted the interest from GSK which has requested consultancy work for a new production process where extrusion control is a critical part.

Based on two previous EPSRC and one POC projects, this novel award winning energy and health monitoring system has been developed for polymer processing and can be directly applied to other manufacturing areas. The system monitors energy consumption at deep level through non-invasive sensing technology. No modification to the existing processes is required, providing a flexible and non-intrusive metering solution. The acquired data is sent wirelessly to a remote data server through the 3G/4G network and useful information is extracted. Users can also access their data and key information through a web browser. The main advantage of our system compared to other alternatives is that information at different granularity levels is collected and linked to energy consumption. This provides better insights into energy usage and leads to substantial opportunities to save energy for energy intensive manufacturing industrial sectors.

This has been achieved via knowledge sharing, brain-storming, knowledge transfer trainings and social networking events. It will also contribute significantly to the capacity building of early career researchers through mentoring scheme and training, and encourage high-impact joint publications and help to foster long-term collaborations of researchers and industrialists through joint application of research grants and formation of a research consortium. Ultimately, it will help achieve the strategic plan of developing all around UK-China collaborations in science and technology in delivering impact, shaping capability and training future leaders. The whole event was attended by over 90 people from UK and China, across different sectors. The workshop covered a wide range of topics, and sparkled a lot of debates, and a UK-China consortium on shaping low carbon energy future has been formed.

The polymer industry makes a major contribution to the UK economy, and extrusion is a fundamental polymer processing stage. However, considerable waste of both energy and raw materials can occur during lengthy change-over and start-up periods, and conservative operating conditions make this situation worse. Furthermore, the extrusion process is highly complex, and incomplete melting of the polymer may occur at inappropriate processing conditions that give rise to poor mixing and localised hot and cold spots, which in turn lead to pulsations in the throughput. As the key melt indicator, viscosity is difficult to monitor online, and as a result of this and the process characteristics described it is difficult to control the quality of an extrudate material and hence the final product. The aims of this research were to advance the state of the art in monitoring and control of polymer extrusion so as to reduce set-up times, waste and energy consumption and improve product quality. Considerable achievements have been made, new technologies developed have taken into account the industrial environment, and close collaborations with other leading research groups in the UK and with local industrial companies have created the potential of direct application of the techniques developed to maximize the impact. Theoretical results have been published in high quality peer reviewed journals, such as Polymer Engineering and Science, Control Engineering Practice, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, and Journal of Process Control, and in leading conferences. The publication record (11 journal papers and 16 conference papers, together with 1 PhD thesis , 1 MEng final year project report, and a few more in the pipeline), the award of an international conference prize, and a number of invited seminars and presentations have very effectively demonstrated the high quality of the research outputs.

Contribution Method: Considerable achievements have been made: 1) We have investigated the pressure model incorporating changes in the machine/die and material properties. 2) We have developed a model identification procedure based on grey-box modelling with a genetic algorithm for viscosity modelling, and further improved a soft sensor approach with a feedback structure to enable the online adaptability of the viscosity model. 3) We have developed a model free fuzzy controller to minimize the variation in melt pressure and temperature. 4) We have developed torque signal acquisition methods and investigated an inferential monitoring approach to the screw load torque signal in an extruder. 5) We have developed a nonlinear model to predict the die melt temperature profile. The model was then used to identify the effects of individual processing parameters on the die melt flow homogeneity and to further identify the optimal process settings to minimise melt temperature variance across the melt flow. 6) We have explored energy constraints and developed a strategy for responding to process instabilities. We have further developed a fuzzy controller for the control of the polymer melt quality including viscosity. 7) We have developed a novel nonlinear multivariate statistical approach based on neural networks for fault detection in polymer processing. 8) We have further proposed novel algorithms for the construction of neural networks and fuzzy neural systems, and nonlinear system modelling and classification. All these new developments have taken into account the industrial application environment, and close collaborations with other leading research groups in the UK and local industrial companies have created a potential of the direct application of the techniques developed to maximize the impact. Theoretical results have been published in high quality peer reviewed journals, such as Polymer Engineering and Science, Control Engineering Practice, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, and Journal of Process Control, and in leading conferences. The publication record (11 journal papers and 16 conference papers, together with 1 PhD thesis , 1 MEng final year project report, and a few more in the pipeline), the award of an international conference prize, and a number of invited seminars and presentations have very effectively demonstrated the high quality of the research outputs.

However, considerable waste of both energy and raw materials can occur during lengthy change-over and start-up periods, and conservative operating conditions make this situation worse. Furthermore, the extrusion process is highly complex, and incomplete melting of the polymer may occur at inappropriate processing conditions that give rise to poor mixing and localised hot and cold spots, which in turn lead to pulsations in the throughput. As the key melt indicator, viscosity is difficult to monitor online, and as a result of this and the process characteristics described it is difficult to control the quality of an extrudate material and hence the final product. The aims of this research were to advance the state of the art in monitoring and control of polymer extrusion so as to reduce set-up times, waste and energy consumption and improve product quality. Considerable achievements have been made: 1) We have investigated the pressure model incorporating changes in the machine/die and material properties. 2) We have developed a model identification procedure based on grey-box modelling with a genetic algorithm for viscosity modelling, and further improved a soft sensor approach with a feedback structure to enable the online adaptability of the viscosity model in response to modelling errors and disturbances, hence producing a reliable estimate of viscosity. 3) We have developed a model free fuzzy controller to minimize the variation in melt pressure and temperature, thus reducing the variation of viscosity. 4) We have developed torque signal acquisition methods and investigated an inferential monitoring approach to the screw load torque signal in an extruder. 5) We have employed a thermocouple mesh technique developed by the University of Bradford to measure the die melt temperature profile of a single screw extruder and developed a nonlinear model to predict the die melt temperature profile from readily measured process parameters. The model was then used to identify the effects of individual processing parameters on the die melt flow homogeneity and to further identify the optimal process settings to minimise melt temperature variance across the melt flow. 6) We have explored energy constraints and developed a strategy for responding to process instabilities, then investigated a model based fuzzy control approach to maintain the die melt temperature variance across the melt flow while achieving the desired average die melt temperature. We have further developed a fuzzy controller for the control of the polymer melt quality including viscosity. 7) We have developed a novel nonlinear multivariate statistical approach based on neural networks for fault detection in polymer processing. 8) We have further proposed novel algorithms for the construction of neural networks and fuzzy neural systems, and nonlinear system modelling and classification. These methods have also been applied to the modelling and control of injection stretch blow moulding. All these new developments have taken into account in the industrial environment, and close collaborations with other leading research groups in the UK and with local industrial companies have created the potential of direct application of the techniques developed to maximize the impact. Theoretical results have been published in high quality peer reviewed journals, such as Polymer Engineering and Science, Control Engineering Practice, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, and Journal of Process Control, and in leading conferences. The publication record, the award of prizes, a number of invited seminars and presentations, and the deployment of award winning Point Energy technologies (http://www.pointenergy.org/) have very effectively demonstrated the high quality of the research outputs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The award winning Point energy technology developed through this project and subsequent EPSRC project on thermal energy management is able to offer low-cost component level energy monitoring, providing actionable insights that reduce energy costs and optimise manufacturing processes.

This was achieved via knowledge sharing, brain-storming, knowledge transfer trainings and social networking events. It contributed to the capacity building of early career researchers through mentoring scheme and training, and encouraged high-impact joint publications and help to foster long-term collaborations of researchers and industrialists through joint application of research grants and formation of a research consortium. Ultimately, it will help achieve the strategic plan of developing all around UK-China collaborations in science and technology in delivering impact, shaping capability and training future leaders. Attendees also include Consul General and Minister Counsellor from Chinese Embassy and NSFC Head of Department, who have since the workshop promoted the UK-China partnership on energy research. The workshop has trained a number of early career researchers, and a network has been established among attendees.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c75775b02437.35426627</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ukchinaenergy.com/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A model identification procedure based on grey-box modelling with a genetic algorithm for viscosity modelling, and further improved a soft sensor approach with a feedback structure to enable the online adaptability of the viscosity model in response to modelling errors and disturbances, hence producing a reliable estimate of viscosity.</gtr:description><gtr:id>52537D62-5E7E-4D65-BD18-7EFA23A0D057</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Soft sensor technology for measuring the melt viscosity of polymer extrusion has won a Third prize in 2012 China (International) Transducer &amp;amp; Sensor Innovation Contest.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7556c055fb7.36670229</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Viscosity inference</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Polymer extrusion is regarded as an energy-intensive production process, and the real-time monitoring of both energy consumption and melt quality has become necessary to meet new carbon regulations and survive in the highly competitive plastics market. The use of a power meter is a simple and easy way to monitor energy, but the cost can sometimes be high. On the other hand, viscosity is regarded as one of the key indicators of melt quality in the polymer extrusion process. Unfortunately, viscosity cannot be measured directly using current sensory technology. The employment of on-line, in-line or off-line rheometers is sometimes useful, but these instruments either involve signal delay or cause flow restrictions to the extrusion process, which is obviously not suitable for real-time monitoring and control in practice. In this paper, simple and accurate real-time energy monitoring methods are developed. This is achieved by looking inside the controller, and using control variables to calculate the power consumption. For viscosity monitoring, a 'soft-sensor' approach based on an RBF neural network model is developed. The model is obtained through a two-stage selection and differential evolution, enabling compact and accurate solutions for viscosity monitoring. The proposed monitoring methods were tested and validated on a Killion KTS-100 extruder, and the experimental results show high accuracy compared with traditional monitoring approaches</gtr:description><gtr:id>0B87F0A6-0786-4162-A9FB-3859A6FB62C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The method has led to the development of Point Energy technology which has won several awards and currently been implemented in several industrial companies for energy saving.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c754a9c04fe8.45639460</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Low-cost process monitoring for polymer extrusion</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.pointenergy.org/</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Point energy technology has been developed to offer low-cost component level energy monitoring, providing actionable insights that reduce energy costs and optimise manufacturing processes (http://www.pointenergy.org/).
