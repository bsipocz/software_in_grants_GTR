Ideas</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/H042741/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>We live in an age of burgeoning information, and increasingly fast information access. The WorldWide Web has allowed us to make many positive changes in our society and environment, for example through social networking and e-publishing, but it also presents problems, by its very nature. There is now so much information being spread so quickly that it is becoming impossible for individuals to be aware of enough of it to enable them to take advantage of it.What is more, because of the information overload, we are having to rely more and more on search tools to find what we want. While existing search tools work quite well, after a bit of practice in using them, they are only able to give us information directly matching keywords in what we ask for. This is clearly useful, but its down side is that we are less likely than before to notice peripheral things, situations or people who are relevant to us, in the kind of serendipity or happy accident that led, for example, to the discovery of penicillin. It's becoming harder to notice such connections, partly because we are more narrowly focused in how we search for new knowledge, and partly because the search systems we use are very literal and not imaginative at all.This project aims to design a Serendipity Arena, called SerenA, which will proactively search information available in users' documents and on the Web to identify relevant knowledge and connections related to their work and their environment. The aim is not merely to search for shared keywords, like existing systems, but to use state-of-the-art technology from automated reasoning and computational creativity to identify things that users did not know they needed to know, using more advanced search based on metaphor and analogy. SerenA will be implemented as a physical presence in the working environment, and via personal technology, such as smartphones. With its users' permission, SerenA will proactively search for people and information in a user's local environment, both physically and virtually, allowing it, for example, to suggest that people who don't know each other might find some value in meeting (perhaps because they share an interest in particular aspects of the academic world), or to suggest a paper omitted by keyword search in a particular e-journal (because it has connections with other things of interest to the user who is searching).SerenA will have its own document-analysis technology, but it will also take advantage of the increasingly rich information available via the Semantic Web. The project will include development of a test-bed of information about music and musicology, as an exemplar of an academic field that can benefit from this enabling technology. Importantly, SerenA will have specially designed and carefully validated user interfaces, to make it intelligible to everyone interested in learning and discovery, of whatever kind.SerenA aims to draw man and machine closer together than ever before, enhancing its users' knowledge and their ability to interact with people likely to be important to them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>SerenA will provide impact to public sector organisations with research as a core activity (e.g. libraries), museums and galleries on a national and regional level. SerenA will facilitate public engagement with their contents and artefacts and create new links for users that would not otherwise have occurred. Commercial private sector beneficiaries will include businesses whose work is related to information search, visualisation or dissemination, such as professional research organisations. In addition, internet industries will benefit from the development of novel algorithms for proactive serendipity. Industries that develop and anticipate future technologies will benefit from using SerenA by establishing and extending links for those within their organisation to inspire the creation of novel interaction tools, systems and devices. The wider public will benefit as they view and user SerenA in public spaces. There will also be a range of indirect impacts as the algorithms developed in the project may lead to benefit in industries not directly concerned with research practices, such as the advertising industry or government agencies. The users of SerenA will benefit within a reasonably short timescale of the project start (i.e. one-three years) and the impact both of the algorithm development and the implementation of ideas generated by SerenA will endure for the longer term. Staff working on SerenA will develop skills ranging from computational algorithm development, integration of mobile and large screen technologies and networks, and application of evaluation methods in requirements specification and system design. The multidisciplinary team of researchers and investigators will all develop research skills in writing, presentation, preparation of public exhibits and technology integration. It is anticipated that all researchers working on the project will develop transferable skills that could be applied in industry, but that could also form the basis of an academic career. A series of engagement activities are integral to the SerenA project. SerenA will be implemented into two types of environments: Research environments (e.g. Horizon DTC) and Public spaces (e.g. Dundee Contemporary Arts, Sensation, Media City). These implementations will ensure engagement with SerenA during the lifetime of the project. We will also run specific dissemination activities with the public and with wider industry. We will run annual workshops that will showcase SerenA outputs, obtain key stakeholder input into SerenA developments, and obtain feedback from industry as to how best exploit SerenA results. In addition to engagement and dissemination activities, we will conduct specific dedicated activities to ensure that SerenA is publicised and delivered into the public and business community as quickly as possible. We will work with knowledge transfer experts at our own universities, with particular support from the Horizon digital economy hub. We will engage in media relations activities via our university press offices and also through a professional quality project website. All researchers on the project will be given the opportunity for training in public engagement, with those researchers who have a particular aptitude and interest in engaging with the public being provided with additional training. To maximise outreach activities we will work with two of the six Beacons of Public Engagement at UCL and Edinburgh. We have secured collaboration with Dundee Contemporary Arts and MediaCity and will work closely with KTN on Photonics and Plastic Electronics. The SerenA investigation team has extensive experience of liaising with the media, supporting start-ups and running conferences and workshops.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1538294</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Booksight is a library information visualisation, designed to curate the real-time flow of book requests which represent the titles and authors of books in a way that offers the viewer novel connections between words and concepts.

Our research conducted on the nature of serendipity, has found that there are several actions and attitudes of mind that can increase the likelihood of serendipity. These include varying routines, being observant, making mental space, relaxing boundaries, drawing on previous experiences, looking for patterns and seizing opportunities.

The workshop commenced with a 'making connections' session which allowed participants to verbally introduce themselves whilst making a web of connections. The salon moved on to learn about the actions and attitudes of mind and apply them (as part of a Design Challenge and co-creation session) to the design of novel digital products, systems or services aimed at creating opportunities for serendipity.

The workshop will concluded with a plenary discussion, with presentations which aimed to contribute to the themes of 'Serendpity City', 'Smart Citizen', 'Discovery Engine' and discuss the challenges of designing to create opportunities for serendipity along with exciting future opportunities for doing so.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54638be4bffc22.56762945</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.serena.ac.uk/2013/03/serendipity-salon-workshop-at-future-everything-21st-march-2013</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Storystorm - Building an 'Autobiography of Dundee'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E983AD9-14F8-473C-8A6E-0C63AB7333AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop featuring experts from across the UK was held in Dundee Contemporary Arts on Thursday November 28th and is inviting contributions from everyone, from designers and architects to collectors of Dundee `stuff' and those who simply had a story to tell about the city.

These data were collected in the form of a guest book and mini questionnaires.

Particularly, the Castle Museum area was the area that our festival participants focused their navigation. It provided an excellent location to demonstrate and provide a hands-on experience of the SerenA prototype because it offered a great environment full of a wide range of stimuli. It furthermore, accommodated a setting of opportunities for fun and educational activities and for promoting the local heritage. 
The event sparked new connections with the Castle stakeholders (contacts that are still maintained and contributing to The University of Nottingham's collaborations (e.g. through EU funding application proposals)). Furthermore, participants that engaged with our event, became attuned with the goals and objectives of the project (and particularly with the notion of serendipity in cultural sites) and became involved in further research opportunities that explore serendipity in culture. Participants also reported that they became more aware of what the Castle Museum had to offer (by for example, getting suggestions to artefacts that they didn't even know that existed) , while the process also helped them to bring back memories and reflections to them.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545f7c30a286a1.07085311</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-and-events/events/festival/events-archive/general-2013/making-connections.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prototype Demonstration: Chance Encounters in the Space of Ideas at CIRCLE Perimeter symposium.

New methods and evaluation techniques were devised to support serendipitous interactions in the research arena. Our research has shown these methods, tools, systems and technologies have had direct research impact in Information Science and Technology, Computer Science, Knowledge Management, Art, Design and Digital Culture and Architecture.

1) Research Impact and Scope
Our initial focus on understanding serendipity had impact beyond researchers. The general public responded to our call for everyday 'stories of serendipity' [1]. In an organisational setting, through knowledge mobilisation with KMb [2] and knowledge exchange sessions with Knowledge Innovation Network (KIN) our research was presented to SME's business, third sector and civil service/government as well as in diverse settings such as libraries, healthcare, law, crime and security. We saw an increase in institutional use of the term and evidence of it's application in practice, from NESTA's 'Productive Coffee Breaks' to Lancaster University's adoption of 'Serendipity Caf&amp;eacute;' workshops. 

2) Process Model and Evaluation
Technology has great potential to create opportunities for serendipity - not simply by providing users with unexpected and potentially valuable experiences 'on a plate' but by supporting them in a number of different ways. Serendipity, as evidenced by grounded in realworld examples, is when a new connection is made it involves a mix of unexpectedness and insight. Projections are made on the potential value of the outcome and actions are taken to exploit the connection, leading to (unanticipated) valuable outcomes. Our process model of serendipity used to define design and engineering challenges identified opportunities to 'support' serendipity. The classification framework used elements of unexpectedness, insight and value was constructed for subjectively analysing an experience as serendipitous. Our empirical research found the following key insights:

Our empirical research resulted in 'serendipity strategies' which included 1) varying one's routine 2) relaxing one's boundaries 3) being observant 4) making mental space 5) drawing on previous experiences 6) seizing opportunities. These strategies have important implications for addressing design of digital tools by component of the process aimed at supporting people to experience serendipity

Information seeking behaviour can be goal driven, or simply encountered and tools to support the generation of ideas and inspiring thoughts, with the potential to trigger follow-up actions are strongly connected to contextual factors (location, activity and focus). 

The prototype research tool 'Semantic Notebook' used reminders that helped people be more receptive to experience instances of potential serendipity or pseudo-serendipity. 

3) Technology
We developed prototype technologies to test our model and strategies to support people experiencing serendipity. 

The Semantic Notebook is a mobile app that supports idea incubation by uniquely combining traditional note taking with novel computing techniques to make meaningful and serendipitous connections to people and information by discreetly extracting terms from the users notes using manually assigned keywords, NLP with semantic reasoning to traverse RDF data to find new and unexpected connections between people and ideas presented as Suggestions.

In order to support the role of the library in the digital age we developed, prototyped and evaluated Booksight library information interactive visualisation. The prototype demoed at The British Library and presented at British Computer Society, won the Imperica Prize 2013 at EVA Conference. It took on the design guidelines to support serendipity such as concepts of reflexivity, playfulness, ambiguity and delight were employed.

SerenA built an underlaying multi-site, pervasive, agent environment to present serendipitous discovery in research using semantic web as a resource to assist. Key findings were:

There is more to be discovered than the things that a user might deliberately search for in attempts to assist researchers by presenting them with information that they did not know they needed to know about their research.
SerenA's underlaying distributed multi-agent system technology, in our knowledge, has not previously been deployed at this scale. 
Future work 
Filtering rather than finding information remains a major struggle in research.
There are possibilities for emergent behaviour, yet to be enabled. Detecting and enhancing such behaviours will be the focus of future work. 
Whilst evaluation of individual technologies (semantic notebook, booksight) has occurred, howver formal evaluation the agent system has not yet fully taken place. However learning and know-how from the system has been incorporated into a follow-on EU project. 
Playful, explorative, ambiguous and delightful interfaces and languages have an influence on the way in which people notice, perceive, interact and potentially retain information, particularly in mobile applications. This has implications for the design of new applications and experiences for research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>x</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6AFA780E-B916-4A6B-93F7-E7AA3FF7B94C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ea726208972.28464007</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.serena.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Android app.</gtr:description><gtr:id>406128D9-06D7-452A-B067-D8E765145C70</gtr:id><gtr:impact>xx</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464bbddd5e743.89752612</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>SerenA Semantic Notebook</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~jamief/archive/serena-android-notebook.tar.gz</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The software developed by Rob Stewart 'Discover me Semantically' is a web tool enabling authorship and download of RDF, and RDF visualization in Linked Open Data</gtr:description><gtr:id>FD97C05C-D49C-488A-9846-3602B9300807</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It was subsequently refactored and incorporated in the development of semantic agent system software and used as part of the evaluation for 'SerenA'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464b100496a97.59427626</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Discover Me Semantically</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://github.com/robstewart57/discover-me-semantically.git</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C0F7049C-D73B-4D39-B06E-5BA262D9E8E9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Designing a semantic sketchbook to create opportunities for serendipity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e6ed02be8ed26e6a69b3c9a1a14241a5"><gtr:id>e6ed02be8ed26e6a69b3c9a1a14241a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Maxwell.
