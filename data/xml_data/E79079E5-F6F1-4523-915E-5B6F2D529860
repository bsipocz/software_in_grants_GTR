The incredible economic growth of China and India in the last decade has led many commentators to suggest that the 21st Century will be an ?Asian century?. This shift in relative power to the East is predicted to have a profound effect on the ethical norms of international society. Understanding Chinese and Indian attitudes to that society, and the norms they promote, is therefore of fundamental importance to theorising what forms of order and ideals of justice will prevail in the coming decades.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This theme will be addressed over three one-day workshops.The first explores the historical record on managing the aspirations of rising powers and seeks to identify Chinese and Indian attitudes to international society. The second examines their views on normative challenges to that society, including the legacy of the American exception, deepening international criminal law, and the expansion of global civil society. The third looks at how the international community could respond to these challenges by reforming global institutions and adapting civil society to encompass non-Western values. It welcomes contributions from across the methodological spectrum.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Communities the research is likely to impact upon include:
Government officials
The seminar series will involve speakers and participants from two relevant departments in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office: the Emerging Powers team within the Policy Unit, responsible for planning and strategy in the FCO towards rising powers such as China and India, and the Human Rights and Global Governance Group, who attempt to coordinate British foreign policy on human rights, democratization and development. Their involvement with this series will allow officials and policymakers the opportunity to understand the challenges they face in trying to promote British values and interests in a multipolar world and engage in dialogue with academics on how the rise of these powers may be peacefully managed. As noted in the case for support, the UK government has made a significant effort to orient their policy resources towards engagement with China and India. This series is therefore timely and policy relevant. Officials from the Cabinet Office and Department for International Development (DFID) will also be invited to participate. 
In addition to UK government involvement, the organiser intends to invite participants from the Chinese and Indian embassies. Their engagement will allow these governments to have an increased understanding of the concerns and opportunities raised by their changing international position, as well as offering insights into how they may incorporate their own vision of international society into the existing normative system.
Parliamentarians
Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the All-Party Parliamentary Groups on China and India-UK Trade and Investment will be invited to attend. The theme of the series would be expected to inform their scrutiny of government policy towards the rising powers and further their understanding of the global and local processes that are affecting China and India's ascendancy within international society.
NGOs
Representatives from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have agreed to participate. The series will also be of interest to a number of international and national NGOs seeking to promote stronger international law, human rights and standards of governance globally. Their involvement alongside government officials from the FCO will allow them opportunities to highlight the normative implications of forging policy towards rising powers - in addition to their pre-existing consultative arrangements. They will also benefit from hearing academic research into the attitudes of these countries to many of the norms they are seeking to promote. A better understanding of the political cultures of China and India and how they view international society is likely to enhance their own efforts to influence the foreign policies of these states and ensure that their advocacy is as effective as possible.
Global academic community
This series endeavours to bring together academics from across the globe, and from a range of disciplinary perspectives, to analyse a problem of real policy significance. The participation of government officials offers academics the chance to have a policy impact and refine their arguments in light of the practical experience of policymakers. The web presence and inclusive participation policy will give academics at various stages of their career the chance to contribute to debates and hone their thinking.

Venues:
In hosting these seminars at the prestigious and convenient locations of Kings College, London, Chatham House and the Centre for Rising Powers, Cambridge, this series will increase its likely impact among opinion formers and experts nationally and globally. These venues are accessible for international speakers and, in the cases of Kings College and Chatham House, are geographically close to the seat of UK government in Whitehall - encouraging the attendance of officials from the FCO and other relevant government departments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17032</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Papers distributed via the website and disseminated to government officials and NGO workers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>15F23FD7-8487-49DA-99CE-E1666C1478A7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5465055d9e0f91.42314778</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>These are best set out during the next reporting period when publications will be listed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Best set out in the next reporting period when publications are listed.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A1AA3135-0E1A-4ABF-8E37-C759CCBE3C65</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54650b17db91c7.08687301</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.risingpowersglobalresponses.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J021261/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
