A key question is in human causal learning is, to what extent are such judgements based on associative learning, or the product of controlled reasoning?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project seeks evidence to dissociate these two accounts, by testing the extent to which participants can recall cue-outcome pairings under a variety of task conditions. Participants will be instructed to work out which cues cause an outcome. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Analyses will examine whether cue-competition occurs under conditions in which participants are not given any direct instruction to learn about the cues in the task. In these tasks any learning about cue information is tangential to the participants' task goal. Evidence for cue-competition effects in these incidental learning conditions would therefore be inconsistent with a reasoning-based account. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>To summarise, the novel methods laid out in this research proposal will permit examination of the conditions under which human learning is governed by associative or reasoning processes. This research will advance our understanding of these fundamental cognitive functions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>169586</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Cue-competition in contextual cuing of visual search (6 experiments; 206 experimental sessions)
These experiments tested the prediction that cue-competition relies on controlled reasoning processes and should therefore not be observed in these low-level learning tasks. The results support this hypothesis: we did not observe cue-competition effects in any of the experiments. In fact, for some designs we observed the opposite effect: learning about the &amp;quot;to-be-blocked&amp;quot; cue was in fact enhanced. This novel augmentation effect suggests that learning in visual cuing is non-competitive and therefore fundamentally different to learning observed in causal learning tasks. 

Additional experimental work using this task examined the role of attention by making distractor sets more salient by manipulating colour. Augmentation effects were also observed under these conditions.

One explanation of the augmentation effect is that participants learn relationships between the distractor elements, forming configural representations of the contextual pattern. We examined this putative process by training sets of distractors in consistent (AB AB CD CD) or inconsistent configurations (AB AD CD CB). The results suggest equivalent learning of patterns in these two conditions and hence provide evidence against configural learning.

2. Modelling of cue-competition in contextual cuing of visual search
Simulation work revealed that a recent model of contextual cuing (Brady &amp;amp; Chun, 2007) predicts a blocking effect using our designs, inconsistent with the observed patterns of data. We have begun work on a new model of contextual cuing which aims to account for the augmentation effects we observed.

3. Cue-competition in sequence learning (4 experiments; 68 experimental sessions)
Our examinations of blocking in sequence learning also demonstrated that cue-competition effects do not occur in these incidental learning tasks. In fact, like in our contextual cuing experiments, the consistent trend is towards augmentation. Simulation work with the SRN, a model of sequence learning, has been conducted to show cue-competition predictions in this model.

4. Cue-competition between contextual and sequence cues (2 experiments; 162 experimental sessions)
Two experiments examined learning of competing contextual and sequence cues. The results support the findings above and recently published findings in the literature (Jimenez &amp;amp; Vazquez, 2010): cues do not compete for learning in incidental learning tasks. 

5. Recognition memory and causal judgements (6 experiments; 141 experimental sessions)
Experiments using a human causal learning task found cue-competition effects in both cue recall and cue-outcome contingency recall, suggesting that cue-competition is driven both by impaired encoding of the blocked cue and of the relationship between the cue and the outcome. This encoding failure is in keeping with associative learning accounts. We also observed a difference in responses between the cue-outcome recall and cue-outcome causal judgements, with the latter failing to show cue-competition effects. This finding is in keeping with results in the literature (e.g., Vadillo, Miller &amp;amp; Matute, 2005) and supports the notion that contingency and causality judgements are only loosely related (e.g., Cheng, 1997). 

In addition, we have used eye tracking technology to explore attentional processes in human causal learning tasks. This work has examined how people process feedback on decisions to update their associations between cues and outcomes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results will be of interest not only for experimental psychologists working in the area of human learning and memory, but also to researchers working on visual cognition in artificial intelligence.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FFE8C7E3-1329-4B77-BF2C-A324E1E513DF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cc9515976343.93939080</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2B4BB7C7-3F57-4439-B869-5D83FEC08A02</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigating cue competition in contextual cuing of visual search.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental psychology.
