The leaks provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden and published in the Guardian and elsewhere since June 2013 provide a unique historical opportunity for this research as they offer unprecedented insights into the workings and extent of digital surveillance. Through programmes such as PRISM (by the US National Security Agency) and Tempora (by the UK Government Communications Headquarters), state-based surveillance has targeted platforms and services that have become a vital part of the infrastructure of everyday citizen communication in the UK and worldwide. These revelations have implications for key aspects of digital citizenship across issues regarding the legal and regulatory framework of digital communications; technical infrastructures and technical standards; everyday interactions with digital communication and advocacy regarding communicative rights; and investigative journalism and press freedom.

Therefore, within a cross-disciplinary and practitioner-focused framework, this project will examine the challenges for digital citizenship posed by the Snowden revelations through four interrelated work-streams: policy, technology, civil society, and news media. These four themes will be investigated through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods as well as participatory action research. The work-streams will collect data through desk research and field research that combine policy document analysis, technical and software analysis, focus groups, interviews and content and discourse analysis. 

The research will be complemented and supported by two workshops that will bring the project team together with other leading researchers and practitioners in the field. The first (September 2014) will be a stock-taking event to guide the fieldwork phase; the second (June 2015) will begin collaborative data analysis and prepare recommendations. Both will include a) 'tech hackathons' for the analysis of privacy enhancing infrastructures and tools, b) 'policy hackathons' for the analysis of privacy policies, and c) 'best-practices' sessions for the review of active citizenship and journalistic practices. These hackathons and practice sessions provide an innovative methodological aspect and add action research as a key component of methodological triangulation. 

Through detailed analysis of the data, the project will develop a comprehensive and integrated understanding of digital citizenship in light of the Snowden leaks. The workshops will facilitate academic-practitioner and expert-user interaction, the sharing of practices and ideas, and the review and analysis of concrete technical and policy solutions, and practical recommendations of interest to policymakers, technological developers, journalists, citizens and activists. 

The project will be hosted by the Cardiff's School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies (JOMEC), one of the leading media and communication departments in the UK. The four work streams will be run by JOMEC staff in collaboration with co-investigators from other key research institutions. An advisory group including leading international academic experts and civil society organisations in the fields of communication policy, technology and digital rights will guide the research, review preliminary results, and contribute to workshops. Bringing together media scholars and computer scientists along with journalists, advocacy groups and technology developers will facilitate genuine multi-disciplinary academic-practitioner collaboration and lay the foundations for maximum future potential impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is designed to benefit the British public at large by a) providing a detailed and accessible analysis of key dimensions of digital citizenship and state-media-citizen relations in light of the Snowden leaks, and b) offering user-friendly guidance on secure digital communication practices. Further, the project addresses the needs of specific groups of stakeholders. 

1) Policy-makers
The policy work-stream will provide policy-makers with detailed data and information about the nature and extent of governmental digital surveillance programmes. An online database will provide a comprehensive overview of relevant privacy laws and regulations; international debates and declarations (e.g., by the Internet Governance Forum IGF and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN); and related policies on issues such as the oversight of security agencies and international sharing of data. The technology work-stream will provide critical knowledge to policy-makers on the technical implementation of both digital surveillance and policy frameworks. In conjunction with the civil society and news media work-streams we will provide crucial evidence about current stakeholder and public attitudes towards policy-related issues such as privacy, security, freedom of expression, and public interest, significantly aiding evidence-based policy-making processes. 

Further, all work-streams will engage civil society groups in shaping the policy framework and developing proposals for policy change. They will bring policy-makers in contact with advocacy groups and facilitate debates on policy reform. 'Policy hackathons' will allow for the collaborative development of concrete policy solutions. 

2) Software developers and network engineers
The technology work-stream will provide accessible outlines of major communication infrastructures and platforms that have been targeted by governmental surveillance programmes. Developers and engineers will benefit from an online inventory and a comprehensive overview of vulnerable infrastructures as well as emerging tools and infrastructures for secure communication, assisting in the development of network protocols, software and encryption schemes. This work-stream will also serve to develop new innovative technical tools and infrastructure solutions for enhancing privacy and will provide an understanding for how code gets used in a security context. 

3) Advocacy groups and activists
Campaigners, advocates and activists will benefit from the development (as part of the civil society work-stream) of best practices to make use of online communication platforms and services in a secure manner. They will benefit from information (generated in conjunction with the policy and technology work-streams) about the ways in which digital surveillance operates and associated risks. Through the data collected in the civil society work-stream with regards to public knowledge and attitudes towards online surveillance, the project will also greatly inform advocacy work around issues of internet freedom and freedom of expression. 

4) Journalists
Journalists, news professionals and media institutions will benefit from a set of recommendations on investigative reporting of sensitive issues, the use of whistleblowers, and confrontations with the state. The news media work-stream will provide journalists with an in-depth analysis of news reporting on online surveillance and related security concerns to help reflect on professional practices at a pivotal time for state-media-citizen relations. In conjunction with the civil society work-stream, it will also provide evidence on public knowledge. Journalists will be actively involved in policy debates around the use and abuse of data, private information, and freedom of expression.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>185898</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media Coverage and the Public in the Surveillance Society - Chaos Communication Congress, Hamburg</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A72B612A-53F4-4F17-9FA2-5DE29E63824B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This talk presented results from the research project.

The project has presented its research at several events for non-academic audiences. This includes the internationally renowned literary Hay Festival in Hay-on-Wye, to a paying audience of 220 people; and the Guardian Privacy Forum, to an audience of journalists and privacy professionals. At the international Chaos Communication Congress held in Hamburg, Germany, research results were presented to an audience of technical experts, and a presentation at the conference Re:publica addressed industry, civil society activists and media practitioners. For both, about 200 participants attended the talks and several hundred watched the online recording. Further, the project members gave talks and workshops on surveillance to civil society activists, including at the Green Gathering, a festival held in South Wales every year, and the Cardiff Anarchist Bookfair.

2. Several working papers were developed and reached professional audiences. The National Crime Agency approached the project for a meeting to discuss the document 'Public Feeling on Privacy, Security and Surveillance', and Rt Hon Gisela Stuart MP of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy engaged with 'Public Feeling on Privacy, Security and Surveillance' public opinion document and asked about findings. 

3. Comprehensive online resource: The project's website has been developed to provide a useful resource for academics and non-academics alike. It includes outputs from the project which are openly available, such as the working papers, but also two databases. One of those is a repository of technical surveillance capabilities which is divided into state surveillance programmes and counter surveillance tools. The second database features relevant laws and regulations with regards to state surveillance. The website has been viewed extensively. 

4. Evidence to policy process: The Principal Investigator, Dr Arne Hintz, met representatives of the Foreign Office and the Home Office in December 2015 to discuss research findings that are of relevance for the review process of the Investigatory Powers Bill. Co-Investigator Prof Ian Brown attended a select roundtable discussion on the Bill at the Home Office, February 2016.

5. Media appearances: The members of the project have appeared on a range of different media programmes and outlets to talk, or included in stories about the major issues surrounding the Edward Snowden revelations. This has included the BBC, internationally renowned outlets such as the New York Times, Forbes and NPR, as well as regional outlets like Wales Online. 

6. Social media engagement: Since the start of the project the twitter account for the project has amassed 1000 followers and was used to tweet project news, and media stories relating to the topic of surveillance. Over the course of its existence it has engaged the audience as evidenced by over 700 retweets, more than 500 mentions, and 420 favourites.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E7CB33FC-0877-4D7A-A199-285CBF064E59</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56def867679e30.88817845</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project &amp;quot;Digital Citizenship and Surveillance Society: UK State-Media-Citizen Relations After the Snowden Leaks&amp;quot; enabled an interdisciplinary group of researchers to investigate specific aspects of internet surveillance in four distinct research streams, and to draw conclusions for contemporary understandings, practices and challenges of digital citizenship.

1. Civil Society:

Focus groups with members of the British public uncovered widespread concerns about surveillance (and thus refuted the perception that 'people do not care') but also a lack of knowledge about how surveillance affects them and how to protect oneself, as well as powerlessness in the face of omnipresent data collection. Young members were more concerned about their online privacy than older groups, and those with an experience of being targeted by surveillance (e.g., Muslim groups) demonstrated more awareness. In what we have called 'surveillance realism', most citizens feel they have no choice but accept being monitored online, even though they do not explicitly consent and often criticise it. 

Interviews with activists found knowledge of the Snowden leaks was limited, online practices had not been altered in most cases, and use of digital encryption technologies was low. This was due to the impression that encryption was complicated and difficult to use, but that it would also make the user appear less transparent and more radical, which confirmed research on the 'chilling effect' of surveillance.

2. Media:

A content analysis of the coverage of surveillance by the British press and broadcast news uncovered a strong pro-surveillance bias. Surveillance tended to be reported on in terms of terrorism and national security, rather than privacy and human rights. Politicians were far and above the most commonly used source. Media coverage has thus justified and normalized state surveillance, and has rendered invisible the implications for normal citizens.

Paradoxically, interviews with journalists showed significant concerns about data collection and monitoring, as well as source protection, and a more critical perspective than was reflected in the reporting. Blogs and alternative publications provided more detailed and critical coverage but addressed mainly niche audiences.

3. Policy:

Interviews with a wide range of policy stakeholders and experts demonstrated the strong impact that the Snowden revelations had on legislative reform in the UK (particularly, the Investigatory Powers Bill which was discussed at the time of research). While most interviewees appreciated the enhanced public and democratic debate about surveillance powers, there were strong objections by industry, civil society and politicians to the surveillance activities by intelligence agencies. However, close collaborations between the security sector and the UK Home Office, and thus direct access by a particular community to the relevant policy powerholder, helped shape UK policy reform and caused an extension, rather than a revision, of UK surveillance powers.

4. Technology:

The technology stream uncovered that the very standards and governance of the infrastructure of digital communication are contested, and that privacy and surveillance are enabled at the (often more obscure) infrastructure level. Interviews with members of international standards organisations revealed how intelligence agencies have compromised the security of internet infrastructure and have thereby inserted surveillance capabilities in technical standards and protocols. However, standards bodies have strengthened privacy protocols in response. The openness of standards bodies has allowed both the interventions by agencies and effective responses.

Digital citizenship:

If the four research areas of this project constitute key requirements of digital citizenship - public knowledge and informed use, an enabling policy environment and trustworthy infrastructure - they demonstrate challenges for digital citizenship in the context of surveillance. Public knowledge is low, democratic debate is limited, policy development disempowers digital citizenship and the infrastructure is compromised. In a datafied environment in which data on digital citizens' communication and other activities is constantly collected, monitored and analysed, the power balance between state and citizens shifts towards the former. However the research also points to opportunities for strengthening and protecting digital citizenship.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has generated academic knowledge on the practical implementation of surveillance, the journalist coverage of surveillance, public perceptions and understandings, policy frameworks, and possible responses. It has advanced academic debates on digital citizenship and has complemented earlier understandings of citizen empowerment through digital technologies with a detailed look at the increased opportunities for state control of citizens in datafied environments. These research results have been presented at numerous conferences and published in two special issues of journals (International Journal of Communication and Digital Journalism), and further individual journal articles. A co-authored book is currently being written by three members of the research team. We expect the results to be taken up by scholars in journalism studies, policy studies, data science, sociology, and other disciplines.

Further, we have created publicly accessible databases of technical surveillance capabilities, emerging tools for secure communication, and relevant laws and policy decisions. These databases (and visualisations) are available on the project website and provide critical knowledge to policymarkers, software developers and network engineers. Data collected on public knowledge and attitudes towards online surveillance will inform policy and advocacy around issues of privacy, internet freedom and freedom of expression. In-depth analysis of news reporting on digital surveillance will help journalists reflect on professional practices at a pivotal time for state-media-citizen relations.

Throughout the project, the research team has sought to introduce its findings into both academic debate and professional practice by working closely with civil society organisations, holding a major international conference, and presenting research results at a wide range of academic conferences, activist gatherings and industry events. At the host institution, Cardiff University, the project has led to a major grant application (ERC) and to the creation of the &amp;quot;Data Justice Lab&amp;quot; where work on the project themes will continue.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FEC76F75-9942-47C6-B537-B5C88C44459A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56def7fd3d6a31.39279460</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.dcssproject.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>It is a database of the technical infrastructures targeted, used and exploited by governmental online surveillance programmes; and the features of technical tools and software solutions that are based around user protection and strategies of 'privacy by design'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9471C618-04CB-476C-BF4E-97A7C25A71B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This database is freely available online for other researchers to use.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deb2663a9364.65343677</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Database of the technical issues relating to surveillance</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.dcssproject.net/technology/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is an inventory of current laws and regulations on privacy, data protection, data sharing amongst public and private sector entities across borders, and the oversight of security agencies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>ADBC28AC-28F7-4783-A889-FB528DA1ABAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This has been publicised online for other researchers to use.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deb1e2aeb643.52398710</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Database of UK government policy relating to surveillance</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.dcssproject.net/policy/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>85F4A6A2-3D27-4A57-8848-4F7649F206CB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digital Citizenship and Surveillance Society: Project Presentation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2dcd50093125b156a93eb904e2e34ffa"><gtr:id>2dcd50093125b156a93eb904e2e34ffa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hintz A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dece7908fd93.43446811</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C27CBDAC-7251-4581-984B-241283FE917E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Normalization of Surveillance and the Invisibility of Digital Citizenship: Media Debates After the Snowden Revelations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Communication</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ef61bef39c82bc01518e6818f6f2d90d"><gtr:id>ef61bef39c82bc01518e6818f6f2d90d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wahl-Jorgensen K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c80c0c2ab736.26410033</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>59F9F406-7EEF-4A22-BEC1-5C53000EC898</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards data justice?
