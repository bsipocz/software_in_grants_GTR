It is based on the Lead Investigator's work on the social history of drinking in England, and will be delivered in partnership with the Department of Health South West Alcohol Improvement Programme. Four subregional workshops will address the role of historical and cultural knowledge in the areas of health provision, crime reduction and licensing policy. Participants will include representatives from Primary Care Trusts, Drug and Alcohol Action Teams, Crime and Disorder Partnerships, local licensing authorities, and third sector organisations. Once completed, a briefing resource will be produced and disseminated to participants and other stakeholders via the Department of Health South West. The resource will provide a toolkit for practitioners seeking to apply historical and cultural knowledge to their work in alcohol harm reduction. The workshops will also promote the establishment of sustainable knowledge and resource sharing networks across a field which is often fragmented, with particular gaps in communication between historical researchers, policy developers and frontline service providers. The need to address the challenge of culture change around alcohol use has been identified as a key strategic goal by a number of Government departments ( Department of Health, Home Office, DCMS and DCSF); this project seeks to make a distinctive contribution to that process by promoting a historically-informed culture among those responsible for designing and delivering alcohol harm reduction policies. It will also seek to promote greater engagement between humanities research and public health provision where relevant.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries\n\nAlcohol service providers in regional Primary Care Trusts; regional NHS public health managers; regional Public Health Observatories; NHS social marketing teams; GPs\nHealth service providers will benefit from this project by developing their capacity to place health provision in a broader historical and cultural context. Effective health communication requires an understanding of both cultural drivers and evidence of approaches that have worked previously. This project will encourage an active engagement with these questions as well as presenting examples of effective practice. The briefing resource will provide an ongoing toolkit for service providers seeking to develop their work in alcohol health communication. \n\nDrug and Alcohol Action Teams; Local Alcohol Partnerships; local Crime and Disorder Partnerships; police\nSupporting culture change is a key strategic goal of statutory bodies dealing with alcohol related crime and antisocial behaviour. This project will develop the capacity of these bodies to place specific cultural trends in a wider social and historical context. \n\nLocal licensing authorities\nThe historical research on which this project is based deals extensively with licensing history and practice. This project will contribute to the development of a historically informed evidence base which will support decision-making within licensing authorities. It will also provide an evidence base for associated policy areas such as policing and planning.\n\nAll participant groups will also benefit from collaborative discussions with practitioners in related sectors. The establishment of knowledge and resource-sharing networks will facilitate sustainable cross-cutting collaboration between these groups.\n\nAcademics working in the history of public health or alcohol\nThere is a significant body of academic work in this area (e.g. Society for the Social History of Medicine; ESRC Network on Intoxicants and Intoxication in Historical and Cultural Perspective; Alcohol and Drugs History Society). However, the links between humanities research and both policy and frontline delivery in this area are weak. This project will support the development of stronger relationships between academic researchers, policymakers and delivery services, thereby developing the capacity for humanities research to make a difference in this field.\n\nHealth advisory groups (e.g. the BMA, Alcohol Concern, NICE)\nAlthough not directly involved in this project, these groups will benefit from a greater understanding of collaboration between historical research and health delivery in practice. This will enhance their already significant expertise in epidemiological and biomedical approaches.\n\nGovernment departments (Department of Health, Home Offcie, DCMS, DCSF)\nAs the partner organisation in this project, the Department of Health South West will benefit from greater historical and cultural knowledge in relation to its own remit, and the establishment of stronger cross-cutting networks with relevant stakeholders and service providers. The project will provide evidence for all other relevant Government departments regarding the role of historical knowledge in the promotion of culture change and the benefit of partnerships between humanities research and health service providers.\n\nThe project has relevance for the goal of achieving culture change around drinking throughout the UK. This has been identified as a key strategic goal by the DCMS, Home Office and DCSF.\n\nThroughout the project, the partner organisation will monitor impacts as part of its remit to promote partnership and support knowledge-sharing. The Lead Investigator will run ongoing follow-up communications with participants and structured workshop feedback will be collated and incorporated into interim reports. The briefing resource will ensure tha</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33294</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of Alcohol Studies (IAS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>National network on licensing and public health</gtr:description><gtr:id>954172CB-B60E-4C0D-867C-C1272034EEAC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Local Government Association / Alcohol Research UK Guidance on licensing and public health (direct outcome); Public Health England Guidance on licensing and public health (indirect output).

Since completing the award, I have become Director of Research and Policy Development at Alcohol Research UK, where my knowledge of alcohol policy plays a critical role in the day-to-day work of supporting and disseminating research. Since the award finished I have given over 20 invited papers informed by my findings to a range of stakeholders including public lectures, policy forums, academic events, and meetings arranged by Government departments, Public Health England, the Local Government Association, Police and Crime Commissioners and charities. I am currently co-chair of a national network on alcohol licensing and public health, and I co-authored widely-disseminated LGA guidance for public health teams on alcohol licensing. I have advised the Department of Health and Home Office on issues around public health and licensing, and played a role in making the creation of a public health licensing objective a viable policy option. Following my project work, I sat on an expert group which developed the influential report Alcohol Focus Scotland 'Re-thinking Alcohol Licensing'. I subsequently became part of a project team evaluating the operations of the public health licensing objective in Scotland. Both reports have informed national and local policymaking. In my current role, I speak regularly on local and national media on alcohol issues, and have published articles in the national press on alcohol policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D0B95649-034B-4740-889F-9EEA069472EA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5450d35d9cc842.05595596</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project sought to enhance the design and delivery of alcohol harm reduction policies in South West England through encouraging wide-ranging engagement with historical and cultural research. It was based on the lead investigators work on the social history of drinking in England and was delivered in partnership with the South West Alcohol Improvement Programme. Four subregional one-day workshops addressed the role of historical and cultural knowledge in the areas of health provision, crime reduction and licensing policy. Over 100 participants attended the workshops, including representatives from Primary Care Trusts, licensing authorities, the police, alcohol and drug services, crime and disorder partnerships, trading standards and universities. A number of guest speakers contributed to the workshops, including academics, urban planners and representatives of consumer bodies. Followup

interviews were carried out with a number of participants. On completion a briefing pack was produced which summarised the findings of the workshops and discussed the key issues in relation to existing research on British drinking cultures. The resource was disseminated to participants and regional directors of public health and a copy was sent to the Alcohol Strategy Team and the Home Office. The workshops promoted the establishment of sustainable knowledge-sharing networks across a field that is often fragmented; they also sought to close the gap between academic research in the field and frontline delivery. The need to address the challenge of culture change around alcohol use has been identified as a key strategic goal by a number of Government departments, and this project sought to make a distinctive contribution to that process by promoting a historically-informed approach to alcohol cultures among those responsible for designing and delivering alcohol harm reduction policies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings demonstrated some of the opportunities arising from applying broad cultural knowledge to local alcohol policy development and delivery. It also provided an early insight into the challenges faced in bringing together public health teams and licensing officials. The latter element has proved to be useful in the context of both a greater role for public health in licensing in England and Wales, and the existence of a public health licensing objective in Scotland. The findings have been taken forward by organisations including the Local Government Association, Public Health England, Alcohol Focus Scotland, Balance North East and the Safe, Sociable London Partnership. They have also informed discussion with central government. As work continues on the application of public health to local licensing, the project findings continue to be of relevance at local and national level.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>75E144C4-C38A-49CE-9B63-ED8F5C0C97AC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7996890002.85872377936a22</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.swpho.nhs.uk/resource/item.aspx?RID=89492</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Government Alcohol Strategy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>685F228B-80DF-45AF-A76E-6AE031047BCD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54514c20031096.46316400</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Public health licensing objective</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B6F58BF-1049-4F95-AC13-C56E4D813B5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work with the national network on licensing and public health has influenced the Local Government Association and Public Health England in publicly supporting a public health licensing objective.
