This research project explores this question by examining the issue of jurisdiction. Rulership was closely associated with providing justice in the Middle Ages, exemplified by the tradition of producing codes of law, but bishops, priests and monks all claimed various degrees of equally well-established exemption from royal (secular) justice. Given the importance of the Church in medieval European society, and the centrality of law to ideas of authority, much hung on the resolution of the issue.

Beginning with the rise of the Carolingian family in the eighth century, a rise closely associated with the reforming ideology promoted by figures such as the Englishman Saint Boniface (d. 755), and continuing through to the emergence in the thirteenth century of a papacy that could plausibly claim a degree of control over Latin Christendom, I shall chart how contemporaries argued about the issue of the jurisdiction of kings and their secular agents over clerics and monks, both on the European mainland, from Francia to Italy, and in England. I shall also use surviving documentary records, published and archival, to investigate how those theoretical arguments related to what actually happened in practice (and vice versa), in order to improve our comprehension of a still poorly-understood topic.

At stake is the potential to contribute towards the resolution of some pressing historical problems. To what extent did the Gregorian Reform, associated with Pope Gregory VII, mark the emergence of the Church as an independent historical force, and so represent a sharp break in western Christian history? Studying the practices of and arguments around royal jurisdiction over clerics before, during and after that reforming moment will provide a means of assessing historical claims of this nature. Can the history of western Christianity be told as one of subtly, steadily increasing secularisation, a process inherent to the religion that laid the foundations for a secular modernity, as some historians and others have recently argued (e.g. Gauchet)? Investigating how boundaries were produced between those classed as formally part of the church and those classed as for these purposes outside it will offer a means of assessing this influential narrative from an empirical angle. Did the limits placed upon royal authority in this period by ecclesiastical restrictions on jurisdiction over ordained clerics and monks contribute meaningfully to the remarkably enduring political fragmentation of the Latin West, a fragmentation that persisted despite the strong bonds of shared culture, history and religion, and prestigious Roman traditions of wide-ranging rule? These are questions of significant scope and importance, whose answers, rooted at least partially in the early Middle Ages, this project will help to uncover.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Who will benefit from this research?
This research will be of interest to a broad section of the wider public interested in medieval history, and audiences concerned with the historical relationship between religion and law (for instance, members of faith communities).

2. How will they benefit from this research?
The wider public will be able to participate in and learn from structured and informed discussion of a set of historical problems with a bearing, albeit indirectly, on contemporary issues. The channels for this interaction are as follows:

From the project's outset, I shall create an opportunity for interaction with interested members of the wider public through a dedicated blog (cross-posted with the Department of History's own well-established blog), which will also serve to promote the project within the research community. 

I shall submit accessible articles to established publications, tailored to two different audiences.
a) a history 'general interest' audience. This can be reached through publications such as History Today, to which I shall submit an article drawing on the research project to discuss the wider question of 'the secular' in the early Middle Ages and its significance for modern historians, perhaps making use of a particular historical anniversary as a hook (for instance, the 8th centenary since the Fourth Lateran Council in 2015).

b) a community interested in the relation between the religious and the secular in contemporary (British) life. I intend to reach this community in the first instance through submitting an article to the the National Secular Society, pitched at explaining the deep roots of the current entanglement between church and state.

Finally, I will also organise public events in Sheffield. One of these will be a series of evening talks in the autumn of 2016, hosted by Sheffield Cathedral, on the theme of religion and law in history, the central theme of this project. The Cathedral has confirmed its interest in the event, and has confirmed that the timing is practical. This series of around six talks will be interdisciplinary in nature, involving colleagues interested in these themes from different departments in the university (Biblical Studies has already confirmed their interest), and will include at least one non-academic speaker. The talks will be recorded and made available online as part of the project's website. The series will be publicised using the Cathedral's public relations mechanisms as well as the University's own outreach networks.

In addition, the academic conference in January 2016 will include a public-facing evening 'keynote lecture' open to members of the public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>145130</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43193E73-7E73-444D-B4C0-DD2E5B484A85</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The blog, Turbulent Priests, has so far had nearly 5000 page views, and 29 comments.

This innovation was not a result of the failure of the Carolingian Empire, as is sometimes proposed, but a consequence of its emergence.
