His criticism of modern architecture stimulated significant professional and public debate. That debate continues today, re-invigorated by the furore over Richard Rogers' scheme for London's Chelsea Barracks and recent recommendations by English Heritage to list architectural landmarks of the 1960s and 1970s, including Milton Keynes shopping centre. \n\nAs architects, critics and communities continue to grapple with the social and aesthetic value of 'modern' architecture, and that grappling continues to inform the environments that are produced and demolished, and in which we live, work and socialise, it seems important to persist in investigating our historical relationship with modern architectural design in a range of social and geographical settings. This study considers that relationship with reference to the work of Kenneth Wood Associates. \n\nKenneth Wood trained at London's Regent Street Polytechnic and established a private practice in Surrey in 1955. The work of Wood's practice, which includes private houses, small housing schemes, churches, offices, schools and recreational buildings, although critically appreciated by contemporary writers and professional colleagues, such as J.M. Richards and Michael Manser, is absent from the historical record of English architectural design of the postwar period. The research explores the reasons why the work of this successful architectural and design practice has been overlooked by architectural and design historians and considers its critical legacy. \n\nA particular concern of the research is to examine the role that geographical location has played in determining critical and historical responses to the work of Kenneth Wood Associates. The removal of wartime building restrictions in the mid-1950s created significant opportunities for newly qualified architects to establish private practices and Wood is one of many modernist-trained architects who embarked on careers in the suburbs at that time. The work of these architects, who played an important role in the development and dissemination of architectural modernism in the postwar period, remains significantly less well-documented than that of their metropolitan peers. \n\nViewed through the lens of speculative development the suburbs have often been represented as sites of architectural uniformity and imitation, removed from the more progressive concerns of the city. Yet the example of individual buildings often appears to challenge that view and suggests that closer examination of the work of successful suburban firms, such as Wood's, may be helpful in opening up new perspectives on the diverse contexts and conditions in which modern architecture was produced after the Second World War, and in which attitudes to modern architectural design were shaped. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Kingston University's Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture has experienced in establishing and disseminating the work of a previously unacknowledged artist and designer to academic and public audiences. AHRC-funded research into the sculptor Dora Gordine has led to the development of Gordine's former studio-home, Dorich House, as a museum; the publication of a monograph and catalogue; a retrospective exhibition supported by public activities funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund; and the creation of a biographical film on Gordine's life and work. The applicant's research will benefit from the significant learning that this project has generated. Colleagues in the faculty are also experienced in the presentation of architectural archives and the exhibition of architectural material to the public (see: AHRC Grant: Representing and Collecting Architecture: The Problem of the Exhibition, 2006). \n\nBuildings designed by Kenneth Wood Associates make and have made a valuable contribution to the local environments and communities within which they are situated. Two buildings by the practice were recently demolished and further planning applications are pending. Organisations that seek to positively influence the planning process, including The Twentieth Century Society and English Heritage, will find the research helpful in supporting their work to sustain the historic environment. It will also be of interest to local authorities as they turn their attention to the contribution that postwar buildings make to local identity, and to the economic, social and environmental benefits that re-use of existing buildings can have as an alternative to new builds. \n\nThe research will be disseminated to a public audience through the creation of a short film (15 minutes) on the work of Kenneth Wood Associates. The film will be presented to public audiences over the course of two Heritage Open Days in 2011 and its creation will ensure a legacy for the project, allowing future dissemination of the research findings online and via broadcast, exhibition and educational environments (see: Impact Plan).\n\nThe most significant domestic project completed by Wood's practice was a home (1965-1968) and private gallery (1977) designed for the Managing Director of Gala Cosmetics, Stanley Picker. Picker, a prolific art collector, founded the Stanley Picker Trust which supports fine art education. Picker's house and gallery contain an important collection of 20th century art and furniture and exceptional examples of late 1960s interiors by Kenneth Wood Associates and Conran Contracts. The research will benefit the curatorial team at the house, adding to the Trust's knowledge of the building and its interiors and enhancing its presentation to the public.\n\nResearch into Dorich House, bequeathed to Kingston University in the 1990s, has raised broader questions about the development of modern domestic architecture on neighbouring sites, Kingston Hill and Coombe Hill. Kenneth Wood Associates designed and completed two private houses in the area and research into these buildings will contribute to a broader body of design historical research that the Modern Interiors Research Centre is developing around architect-designed homes in Surrey, and which is being disseminated through the public outreach programme of Dorich House Museum. \n\nThe archival material that Kenneth Wood has donated to Kingston University represents a significant unpublished source of evidence on the architecture and interiors of the 1950s-1970s and will be of interest to visiting researchers. Its availability will be publicised via relevant JISC lists and research networks. The archive will be made available within the University, as a teaching resource for use in postgraduate and undergraduate modules in architectural and design history.

Organisational change. Since 2012 and as a result of the public activity supported by this grant, the Stanley Picker Trust has begun offering public tours of the Picker House for the first time. These draw directly on research completed as a result of this grant, increasing public understanding, and appreciation of modern British architecture within a suburban context. The Trust has also sustained its participation in the annual Heritage Open Day programme since the award was completed. Cultural enrichment.

It established a history of Wood's practice and situated it within a British context and in relation to the development of modern architecture internationally in the post-war period. A particular concern of the research was the location of Wood's firm and the types of environments in which it operated; suburbs of late nineteenth or early twentieth century origin and spaces on the fringes of expanding commuter towns that have often been represented as sites in which modern architecture was compromised and failed to fulfil its early promise. Taken as a case study, Wood's firm has opened up new perspectives on the suburb as a space of architectural practice. The research identified the local networks - of design professionals, retailers, clients and employers - that supported Wood's work and revealed their distinctiveness from those that operated within an urban setting. Through the research the design of the modern house emerged as a particular strength of Wood's practice. Analysis of the firm's Surrey houses of the 1950s and 1960s has shown that it attracted a particular type of client, who aspired to something other than the standard suburban semi or more novel type of modern dwelling that Eric Lyons and Span were pioneering in Surrey and elsewhere. Mapping those clients - culturally engaged, middle-class professionals, who came principally from the fields of art, design and music - has suggested certain similarities with early supporters of modern architecture who commissioned houses before the Second World War. Through an examination of the houses that Wood designed, the research has added to knowledge of the development of modern domestic architecture and the ways in which the particular individual requirement of clients - for working spaces, for example, and for houses that could be economically altered to meet changing family needs - led Wood to develop new approaches to the design of the modern house. Another important focus of the research was the network of interests that informed Wood's work - the buildings, values, professional practices and concerns that were most alive for him as he developed his designs. Through an investigation into his participation in an architectural competition, sponsored by the Canadian lumber industries in the 1950s, the research identified Wood as being among those British architects who were most actively involved in the promotion of timber homes in Britain at that time. Tracing his participation in the competition has revealed the wider cultural impact of the activities of the Canadian lumber industries on the design of the British post-war home. The research findings suggest a more complex pattern of architectural development in the suburbs than has been hitherto acknowledged and offers a framework for further investigation into the contribution of the small suburban firm to the development of modern architecture in post-war Britain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As a case study of a small suburban firm, the research has suggested that further examination of lesser known architectural practices has significant potential to enrich understanding of the diverse contexts in which modern architecture has evolved since the Second World War. The research employed a design historical methodology and as such offers an interdisciplinary framework for future enquiry into local networks of production, consumption and mediation and the ways in which they have supported architectural developments. It is envisaged that the main written outputs from the grant, which will be published in spring 2015, will help draw attention to the architectural contribution 'local' architects such as Wood and that the research is likely to be of interest to organisations such as the Twentieth Century Society and English Heritage, as well as planners, who may find it helpful in supporting their work to sustain the historic environment. Wood's network of clients, in particular, suggests that further mapping of spaces of practice and the historical role of the designer as client may open up new insights into the informal transfer of design knowledge and practices across disciplinary fields.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0F65A248-1DE2-43AD-9C2B-564CD52F5121</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54622005d82455.43841590</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C447E5FF-2BE1-417D-AD61-F90E7CBFAD9C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Picker House and Collection.
