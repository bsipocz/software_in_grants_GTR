They are important structurally in bones, muscle, connective tissue and skin, and are responsible for the majority of biomolecular processes such as synthesis, degradation, signalling, transport and motion. In addition to their biological role, they are invaluable technologically as catalysts, pharmaceuticals, sensors, biomaterials and in many other applications. However, proteins are large and complex molecules made up of hundreds of amino acids joined together in a long chain. We still have much learn about what makes proteins adopt particular shapes in order to carry out specific functions. 

The goal of the proposed research is to develop and implement a new method to predict protein stability. This new method will not only be able to predict stability but also explain in intricate detail how this stability comes about. Such detail is essential to understanding protein function and guide the design of new proteins. Computer simulation is a valuable way to predict molecular structure and stability. It generates a large number of structures which can be used to predict stability. While a number of methods have already been proposed to predict stability using computer simulation, they are largely based on methods appropriate for small molecules are not yet accurate and reliable enough to be useful for proteins. My approach will incorporate a number of new features that reflect the complexity of proteins, building on my experience to calculate the stability of liquids and solutions and to study the structure of proteins. This approach has already led to the most accurate characterisation yet of the structure and dynamics of water, still a complex and controversial question. Water is a key component surrounding proteins that will explicitly accounted for and not be ignored as many approaches do. Another key attribute of our approach is that the entropy is evaluated hierarchically over the many length scales of a protein. Furthermore, our approach is able to handle the intrinsic flexibility in a protein by using the forces on atoms to determine how mobile they are, defining structure in terms of contacts, and considering all of the astronomical number of configurations. The new tool will be made publicly available to all scientists to help them study their systems. 

Having developed the method, we will test it, firstly by measuring how well it predicts the solubility in water of a range of small organic molecules by comparing with results obtained using another simulation method that does work for small systems. Next we will examine how well the method works at predicting stability of small proteins by comparing with the relative stabilities measured from very long simulations. The third test will be in an experiment called CASP whereby participants have to predict protein structure based on the sequence of amino acids. As well as testing we will consider two applications: firstly, we will apply the method to determine the stability of the same set of small proteins as they are folded in order to learn about the mechanism of protein folding; secondly, we will examine how various solutes and ions stabilise or destabilise protein structure. The information gained from addressing both these questions will substantially improve our ability to understand protein function and design new proteins.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A new method is proposed to calculate the free energy of a protein from computer simulation. The free energy consists of enthalpy and entropy. The enthalpy can be readily measured from simulation but the entropy cannot. While a number of methods have been proposed to do this, they are largely based on methods appropriate for small molecules and are not reliable enough for proteins. Our method has a range of new features to overcome these limitations:

1. Entropy is evaluated hierarchically over multiple length scales. 
2. The entropy of water and ions are explicitly included using new theory developed by my research group.
3. Vibration entropy is elegantly evaluated in the protein's reference frame using forces.
4. The vast number of conformations are calculated combinatorially.
5. Conformations are characterised using nearest non-bonded contacts. 
6. Quantum effects are accounted for using effective harmonic potentials.

The main idea is to derive effective potentials for every conformation based on the forces measured in a computer simulation. Conformations are defined using nearest contacts at a hierarchy of length scales. Quantum effects account for high-frequency motion for strong interactions. The potentials are integrated and summed together to give the full partition function and entropy. From a single simulation the method gives explicit detail of the entropy components and structural variation at a hierarchy of length scales. 

The method will be extensively tested by comparing the Gibbs energy of hydration for small molecules with results from perturbation, by comparing the stability of proteins with the probabilities measured from long simulations, and by entering the 11th CASP experiment for protein prediction. The method will be applied to study the mechanism of protein folding and the effect of small molecules on protein stability. The method will be made available for public use as an add-on to the GROMACS and AMBER software packages.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Already a substantial proportion of industry makes use of proteins in a wide variety of settings. There is tremendous scope for growth. This method and the expertise that we develop will provide a competitive advantage to UK protein-related industries. The many examples of proteins include:

* Enzymes: biotechnology companies use proteins to catalyse numerous reactions e.g. chemical synthesis, food production, cellulose degradation to make biofuels, photosynthesis and hydrogen production. Changing amino acids to optimise these functions can affect protein stability. Protein stability also has to be considered in working out the optimal reaction conditions. The participating companies in CoEBio3 in the Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre will all likely have an interest in how this method can help them.

* Drugs and pesticides: protein stability contributes to protein-ligand binding. Many new drugs are proteins themselves. AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, to name a few of the many companies, will be able to use this technology to help guide the design of new products. 

* Biomaterials for artificial prosthetic replacements, stem cell cultures or organ replacements.

* Biodegradable materials: there is a pressing need for cheap, packaging materials that are biodegradable. 

* Enzymes in cleaning products e.g. as made by Unilever.

* Sensors: proteins can specifically detect pollutants, biomarkers of disease, or drugs and explosives. 

* Software companies that develop molecular modelling software to carry out tasks such as protein design and structure-based drug design e.g Evotec. 

* Any predictive modelling: companies that makes use of molecular simulation stands to gain from this free energy methodology. This includes the petrochemical industry in designing better refining methods and fuel additives, and the chemical formulations industry in developing, for example, personal care products and cleaning agents.

* General health: our greater understanding of protein stability and function will improve our knowledge of health which will provide better guidance to the public on how to live their lives as well as deepen the fascination that the public has for the natural sciences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>267922</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>For the new method for the entropy of flexible molecules, it is is too early to judge. Regarding the work on understanding the structure and dynamics of water, the ideas are controversial and, even if correct, will take a long time to be accepted. 

The work on parameter-free methods to analyse molecular structure are preliminary and we are exploring their further use.</gtr:description><gtr:id>641FFA0D-C153-4AC7-B44B-F1DC9AA39539</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5456140d035213.32926766</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>One main advance, published in October 2014, was the successful extension of my entropy method to flexible molecules in collaboration with Dr Frauke Grater of the Heidelberg Institute of Theoretical Studies and Dr Ulf Hensen of ETHZ. Calculating entropy for flexible molecules is a challenging goal. Our method is simple to understand and apply, much more accurate than existing methods, and it should be straightforward to combine it with my existing theory for solvation entropy.
 
Two related papers have been published in collaboration with Dr Julien Michel of the University of Edinburgh and Dr Richard Law of Evotec on the contribution of water's entropy to solvation and binding.

Another main issue resolved was a way to define atomic neighbours for any configuration without using cutoff parameters. The culmination of this work was the relative angular distance (RAD) algorithm. This generalised our parameter-free nearest-acceptor hydrogen-bond definition in 2010. Stepping stones to RAD were an intermediate paper on the coordination of ions in solution and classifying protein secondary structure using the nearest-acceptor hydrogen-bond definition. 

A third area was work on the structure and dynamics of water. This comprised two papers by me showing how hydrogen-bond stability continuously shifts from stable to unstable according to the neighbouring hydrogen bonds. This helps bring about water's dual two-state and continuous nature. I also guest-edited a special issue of Chemical Reviews on the start-of-the-art in water research, contributing to two of the reviews.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Useful to anyone who runs a computer simulation of molecules and wishes to calculate their entropy.
