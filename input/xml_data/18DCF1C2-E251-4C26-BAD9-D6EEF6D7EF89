Damage to DNA induced by radiation and reactive oxygen species is of pathobiological significance especially in cancer. Ionising radiation may be considered as a two-edged sword; it may induce cancer or other adverse responses in normal tissue or alternatively it may lead to killing of tumour cells, of considerable importance in radiotherapy. If the damage is not removed by proteins which repair the damage to restore the correct genetic blueprint, mutations as a result of changes in the genetic code may form and lead to significant biological consequences, such as cancer and age-related diseases. An important feature of ionising radiation is its ability to cause very complex changes to DNA (clusters of damage) which are very difficult to correct as the repair proteins do not easily recognise the damage. ||The objective of the research is to understand how complex genomic changes are formed by ionising radiation in cells and to understand how they interfere with maintenance of the genetic code. These complex DNA changes are implicated in cancer induction at environmentally levels and medical exposures of radiation and the killing of tumour cells, important in the treatment of cancer by radiation.|||</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Summary of aims: To understand the mechanisms leading to the induction of radiation-induced DNA damage in cells; to identify the critical features of its DNA damage complexity which may compromise its recognition and/or processing required to maintain the integrity of the genome and the consequences to the effects of human exposure to radiation which may be detrimental to health or lead to tumour cell death, which is of relevance to radiation oncology. ||Clustered DNA damage sites, in which two or more lesions are formed within a few helical turns of the DNA after passage of a single radiation track, are signatures of DNA modifications induced by ionizing radiation in mammalian cells. ||The cellular response to DNA damage is modulated by the types of damage induced and maintenance of the stability of the genome is important to minimise the formation of mutations which may lead to cancer, even at environmental levels of radiation exposure. An important feature of ionising radiation is its ability to induce clustered DNA damage against a high background of endogenously induced oxidative damage. The complexity of clustered damage is thought to be a major feature that determines the biological effectiveness of radiations of different quality. ||The research focuses on identification of the chemical processes leading to DNA damage, the recognition and processing of DNA damage to identify the critical lesions and repair pathways involved in the biological responses to ionizing radiation of different quality, such as radon and artificial alpha emitters. ||The identification of the unique features of specific types of DNA damage produced by radiation is important for i) understanding the short and long term health effects of human exposure to induce cancer at low doses and ii) inactivation of tumour cells at high doses conventionally used in radiotherapy||The early chemical pathways and specificity of radiation-induced DNA damage are investigated using fast reaction techniques, low energy photon light sources and sequencing gel electrophoresis. ||The processing of synthetic clustered DNA damage or complex double strand break termini in oligonucleotides, as models of radiation-damage, are assayed using human cell extracts from normal and repair deficient cell lines or purified repair proteins. The processing of these damages by cell extracts/enzymes is assessed by gel electrophoresis or using labelling techniques specific for the enzymes. ||Cellular DNA damage is investigated following irradiation of mammalian (V79,CHO) cells or human cells (HF19) with radiations of different quality. DNA damage is determined using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. DNA double strand breaks and associated repair proteins are determined using immunofluorescence as an indicator of DSBs in individual cells and confocal microscopy.||</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1985-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>880184</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U142737347</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
