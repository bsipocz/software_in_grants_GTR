Such resistance to change represents a highly disabling aspect of these disorders because it commonly precipitates behaviour problems that have a major negative impact on the lives of individuals with the disorders and their families.

Evidence from experimental studies shows that this resistance to change is associated with limitations in cognitive flexibility (task switching), which is the ability to think about situations differently depending on changing demands. Furthermore, work on the typical development of cognitive flexibility suggests that - from both theoretical and empirical perspectives - this may be facilitated by exposure to environments with specific characteristics, namely those comprising flexiblility. Finally, our own work with individuals with PWS suggests that exposure to more rigid routines can be detrimental to an individual's subsequent ability to deal with changes, perhaps particularly when this exposure occurs during early school years.

Taken together, this evidence suggests that an intervention strategy which increases flexibility in the environments that children are exposed to during early school years (when cognitive flexibility is developing rapidly), may be effective in preventing the development of disability linked to resistance to change. The present project aims to develop such an intervention strategy capitalising on current best practice, which advocates use of visual schedules to structure environments (to avoid changes that may precipitate contemporary behaviour problems). Thus, the inherent limitations of best practice implied by the evidence outlined above, will also be addressed.

Critically, the present project aims to develop the intervention strategy and an associated implementation monitoring tool, collaboratively with stakeholders to maximise acceptability. Furthermore, the feasibility of implementing the intervention and monitoring; the capacity of the intervention to increase flexibility in children's routines; and the feasibility of the measures needed to evaluate the intervention in future pilot work will be assessed.

The present work represents an essential step in the creation of a new intervention strategy that can prevent the development of disability linked to resistance to change, which is relevant for individuals with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Importantly, resistance to change is associated with particularly high negative impact (most disabling) for many families but is not well addressed in existing prevention approaches. Thus, the present strategy would be the first to systematically target prevention of resistance to change.

The work will enable a future pilot randomised controlled study. The future planned pilot study will evaluate how far exposure to increased flexibility in routines during early childhood - mediated by the presently developed flexible visual scheduling caregiver led intervention - can prevent the development of disability linked to resistance to change, via increases in cognitive flexibility. Since in the present project, the intervention will be developed collaboratively to maximise acceptability; if the outcome of the pilot study suggests its efficacy, this can be immediately followed by a large evaluation, designed to enable the intervention to be used to decrease disability on a wide scale.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X (FXS) and Prader-Willi syndromes (PWS), are characterised by highly disabling resistance to change.

This resistance to change appears to be associated with specific deficits in cognitive flexibility (task switching). The development of children's cognitive flexibility is sensitive to environmental experience; and our work with individuals with PWS indeed suggests that limited flexibility in routines, perhaps particularly in early school years, may hinder subsequent ability to deal with change appropriately.

We hypothesise that increasing flexibility in children's routines in early childhood will decrease the subsequent development of disability linked to resistance to change; and that this effect will be mediated by gains in cognitive flexibility. We plan to test this hypothesis in a future pilot randomised controlled study (the main study). 

In the present work we propose to develop a caregiver led flexible visual scheduling intervention, capable of increasing the flexibility in children's routines. The intervention will capitalise on current best practise, which includes use of visual schedules. 

A collaborative design process will be conducted with the parents of children with ASD, FXS or PWS; and with relevant teachers and intervention practitioners. The design will include multiple stages of flexible scheduling prototype development and refinement to maximise acceptability, followed by beta-testing to identify and address primary potential limits to feasibility. A tool for monitoring intervention implementation will be developed in a parallel process.

The feasibility of flexible scheduling implementation; and its capacity to increase flexibility in children's routines; will be evaluated over one month. Planned outcome measures for the future pilot study will be administered and assessed for feasibility.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) Caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders who take part in the proposed research, and their children

Depending on the age of the child, some of these individuals may benefit from the educational intervention directly via our future research (the main study and future trials). These individuals may also benefit during the present work from caregivers' increased awareness of the effect of the environment on their child (via the study assessments), which may allow them to develop their own strategies to improve wellbeing. They may also benefit during the present project from the techniques that will be presented in the educational intervention for communicating schedules to children because these methods of communication could be beneficial in other areas.

2) Children with Prader-Willi syndrome and their caregivers who take part in the main study

These individuals may benefit in the ways described above (1).

3) Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders associated with disability linked to resistance to change, who are not taking part in the main study, and their families

These individuals may benefit from the people with neurodevelopmental disorders developing less disability linked to resistance to change. They may also benefit from improved communication that may be mediated via the techniques included in the educational intervention.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147875</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R000883/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
