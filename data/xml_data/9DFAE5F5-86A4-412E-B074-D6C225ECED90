I propose that a more useful division is between 'monsoon China', a tropical, mountainous land that in the Middle Period (c. 600-1400) became one of padi fields and maritime trade, and a continental zone that had long comprised a range of ecologies mixing varying degrees of agriculture, stock-rearing and overland trade. This places the transitional zone 800 miles further south, in the River Huai basin, between the Yellow River and the Yangzi, undermining the environmentally determinist contrast between 'civilised' China and 'barbarian' nomads, and offering new ways of viewing the northern zone in particular.\n\nFrom 600 to 1400 the dynasties of imperial China progressively lost control over the continental zone, but a sinocentric scholarship has suggested that little of consequence happened north of the Chinese empire. Now new and ongoing research suggests that the continental zone, already extensively interconnected for centuries before 600, continued to enjoy complex interactions throughout the Middle Period. This project traces a shared repertoire of practices, beliefs and material culture that was drawn on from the Yellow River valley to the Mongolian steppe and from the Silk Road oases to Japan. Similar ideas of loyalty, which underpinned fluid and adaptive political structures, are found in regimes listed in China's dynastic sequence and in nomadic political units from the grasslands. Buddhist practices travelled from the Silk Road to the Liao (907-1125) and Xi Xia (1038-1227) dynasties and on to Japan. The same unglazed grey pottery is found in the Gansu corridor, throughout Mongolia and in Manchuria down to at least 1200.\n\nBy contrast, in the Song dynasty (960-1276), increasingly focused on the monsoonal zone, we know that ruling elites embraced newly rigid ideas of loyalty and political organisation, and responded to Buddhism's hold on the populace by sponsoring an anti-Buddhist neo-Confucian orthodoxy that prescribed behaviour, while technological advances produced new and distinctive types of fine ceramics. This research will argue that monsoon China not only grew apart from the continental zone but also sought to define itself against the 'barbarian' northerners. Both regions also appear to have directed their trade more towards their other neighbours - across the South China Sea and the overland Silk Roads respectively - than towards each other.\n\nThis radical rethink of China's geography opens up vast new areas of research, particularly in the continental zone. It aims to transform ways of thinking about the place we call China, not only in the past but also in the present. This will be of interest not just to scholars but to policymakers, the media, those needing to understand China for business purposes, and the general public.\n\nThe project reinterprets existing scholarship in light of my own primary research on loyalty, political networks and material culture, and new findings in archaeology and historical analysis relating to China, Mongolia, Japan, Korea, the Silk Roads and the South China Sea. The approach emphasises the social aspects of political history, including the relationships between individuals within ruling groups, between central decisions and what happened in the borderlands, and between elite and everyday life. Nine months of analysis and writing will produce a 60,000-word contribution to Volume 2 of five comprising a New World History, an unprecedented international undertaking to write an integrated history tracing the evolution of global society from prehistoric times to the present, to be published in English and German by C.H. Beck and Harvard University Press. There will also be conference papers, an article, a public lecture and pieces for scholarly and policy websites and the press.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>* Domestic and international policymakers, especially dealing with Central Asian states, Japan, Korea, and especially the People's Republic of China. \nThe work offers particular benefits where policies involve China's regions, interaction between them and between the regions and central government, Chinese attitudes towards non-Chinese, the varied relationships of Central and East Asian countries with China, trade and long-distance communications across East Asia, and regional, central or transnational claims to territory, resources or peoples that rest upon putative historical antecedents. UK-based policy-makers are the most obvious beneficiaries, but because the main output will be published by Harvard University Press there is also the potential to influence policy-makers in North America and other places that employ North American scholarly output. More sophisticated interpretation has the potential to inform more effective and beneficial policies. The likely timescale of these benefits would probably be measured in years rather than months. They will be fostered by articles for the History and Policy website and a current-affairs periodical or broadsheet newspaper.\n\n* The media, writing about East and Central Asia as part of general newsgathering activity and to inform the general public about the background to current affairs. \nThis research offers the potential to seed within this group an understanding that the territorial extent of 'China' is not a given and does not have the ancient history claimed by the standard PRC narrative and often implied even in scholarly work. There are opportunities to foster a more sophisticated and robust approach to, for example, PRC complaints about how foreign journalists report events in 'China', news stories involving China's regions, and in particular the reporting of international relations involving different players within East and Central Asia. This impact could occur in a matter of months, as the media's approach to the region is developing rapidly. I will reach this audience through an article for the China Beat website and the periodical or newspaper piece noted above.\n\n* Those seeking commercial partnerships in East or Central Asia.\nIn a climate of increasing concern about the moral and ethical aspects of business practice, those considering trading with companies or governments, or establishing commercial operations in this region, need to pay attention to its politics. There are also practical considerations, such as the need to be aware of the likelihood - and the reasons behind - civil unrest and even military activity. This research could potentially provide the basis for future consultancy: selling a toolkit of concepts and associated business-related questions to guide companies as they negotiate commercial and related relationships in this region. This could help them to avoid some of the pitfalls - both in the region and in terms of how their ventures are seen at home - of working in such unfamiliar locations. Businesses would want quick returns from consultation, but a significant part of that would be to point out how long it takes to develop lasting relationships of trust within many of the societies in this region. I would seek indications of this sector's interest in such advice by ensuring the addition of a new East Asia section, featuring this research and its potential commercial relevance, to my university's online Research Directory.\n\n* Participants in the University's outreach activities, notably the Insights Public Lecture series.\nThis impact would be immediate upon the delivery of the lecture, which would be likely to draw an audience in the hundreds from the Newcastle area. I would foster evolution of interest among individual audience members by making available at the lecture copies of web and other media articles arising from the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84584</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TSD lecture</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F26C575-9DF9-438F-BD8A-476A66F1E72A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visiting lecture series: 'The problem with borderlands: shared practices in premodern eastern Eurasia', Centre of Medieval Studies, University of Amsterdam; University of Edinburgh; University of Wales, Trinity Saint David</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9253152477.7907430c167cd2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Inaugural lecture</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>75C5F59A-3939-4D16-BE45-C150B25090EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Inaugural lecture: Ecology and politics in premodern eastern Eurasia</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7379312056.4700220cba64c8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk for Historical Association, Birmingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>41427791-AC39-4909-9D10-7C51F9089A30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk to local Historical Association: 'Ecology and politics in premodern eastern Eurasia', Birmingham</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd91794a1590.41776309</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>So far I've used my findings in numerous seminar and conference papers, and one of these has been used in a graduate course at Yale, which elicited a written response from one student.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>99F7AAFE-B224-4DF8-97BF-B441483ACA40</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>544d3b4544c554.82093258</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Development of model of 'shared practices' for understanding Eurasian interactions c. 200 to c. 1000 and modifications to the model thereafter in the new geophysical, economic and ideological space of what is now south China.
