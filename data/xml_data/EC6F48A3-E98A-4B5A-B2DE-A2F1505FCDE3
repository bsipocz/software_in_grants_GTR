the Jewish LGBTQI Community</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M006085/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Nationally, it is estimated that around 75% of Jews are affiliated to Synagogues. For many Jews religious practise involves an uneasy tension between modernity and belief in civil liberties/human rights; and Torah mandated rejection of non-heteronormativity. This project sets out to engage with LGBTQI Jewish participants to complicate the binary narrative of either observant Jew or someone who identifies as LGBTQI and in so doing explores the nature of community, belonging and community (dis) and (re)connection.

'Ritual Reconstructed' is inter-disciplinary in design, and includes a core of theological and philosophical conceptualisations, wedded to theoretical understanding of the nature and impacts of 'community membership' (and disconnection therefrom) viewed and theorised through innovative arts practices. The findings will then be treated to theological and practice analysis and re-presented as a vehicle for both policy and transferable religious practice development within the Jewish and other faith communities.

Judaism (and by extension Christianity and Islam which share a common root) is a religion in which traditional rituals and practices often marginalise members of the LGBTQI communities as a result of a presumptive heterosexuality. Despite this, religious traditions often play a key role in shaping identities, providing adherents with a set of values, hope and a sense of meaning. For members of minority ethnic groups who have experienced histories of disconnection, discrimination and exclusion and who are still regarded as in some senses 'othered' a sense of ethno-faith based disconnection from 'mainstream' society may also exacerbate a sense of 'difference' and division from other members of the LGBTQI communities. This may manifest as a sense of distance from LGBTQI normative social expectations and cultural values (i.e wishing to spend Friday night in a Jewish cultural/community setting; or tensions around being seen as 'religious' within broadly secular LGBTQI communities) adding to a set of multi-layered disconnections for individuals seeking to balance competing identities and social demands. Emergent progressive Jewish thought and discourse around ritual practice considers that it is possible to 'queer Halakhah' in a way which may indeed not rupture with tradition or be distinct from earlier forms of Rabbinic thought, enabling this project to contemplate non-linear and future oriented approaches to enhancing community well-being and re-connecting LGBTQI Jews to the wider Jewish community. The project will follow LGBTQI participants throughout the ritual cycle engaging with community members as they create and illustrate (on film) the processes of recreating ritual (e.g. LGBTQI Havurah; 'queer Seder'; alternative Purim parties and the incorporation of alternative translations into traditional Haggim (Yom Kippur/Rosh Hashanah) liturgy. The process of recreating ritual will lead to a film, presented in 'chapters', which may be used in educational settings, which will be launched at an end of project event in which philosophers, theologians and LGBTQI participants (some of whom may be members of the rabbinate) will discuss the meaning and process of such reconstructed ritual in recreating interleaved LGBTQI-Jewish identities. In addition, participants will engage with a 'ritual bricolage' project in which personally meaningful ritual objects are (re)viewed and presented through film, story, music or plastic art (in a format to be decided by the participants themselves), culminating in an exhibition which can be toured alongside the film product.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are a number of anticipated pathways to impact arising from this project (see below). While some will be self evident and emerge during and at the end of this project (e.g. the production of a film/on-line resources and symposia report) and will be clearly measurable (i.e by monitoring website unique 'hits', requests for further information, etc.) it is likely that other impacts will only become more obvious in the months and years ahead. In particular we anticipate slow change in relation to Rabbinic (and wider inter-faith) response to theoretical outputs leading (we anticipate) to a growth in discourse around queering text and LGBTQI/non-binary specific approaches to ritual practice. As such we would expect to measure demonstrable impacts from this piece of work across a number of years (tentatively emergent by the next REF) as the arguments and practices advanced within this collaborative project gain traction. This proposal has from the beginning benefited from specialist community knowledge which is inextricably entwined in the co-production/co-design of the project. 

Main beneficiaries will be: LGBTQI Community faith-group members (primarily Jewish but also, following knowledge transfer/inter-faith engagement, members of other faith communities). In addition to the anticipated tangible benefits of participation for individual participants (which will be reviewed via feed-back surveys and analysis of the outputs from the bricolage project e.g pertaining to sense of confidence or increased belonging in 'queer' faith communities) this project will have wider implications in terms of changing practise and opening up dialogue on LGBTQI and ritual involvement. For Jewish (and wider faith-group) members of LGBTQI communities who are not involved in this project, or who may be isolated from community members as a result of location or rejection by their faith community, the availability of resources via the website and ability to contact Knan/ Rainbow Jews (or appropriate faith specific support and advice hubs which may exist or come into being) will also reduce isolation; potentially enhance intra-community cohesion; and increase knowledge of resources and emergent theological thinking. Organised civil society groups (eg international LGBTQI faith groups) will be able to draw upon materials and use the outputs as a way of commencing dialogue with Rainbow Jews/Liberal Judaism and wider faith communities in relation to inclusion/equality matters. 

Rabbinate/Wider Clergy will be able to engage with the theological outputs as a way of opening dialogue within their communities; in seminaries/training colleges and amongst themselves, with a view to exploring the inclusiveness or otherwise of faith based ritual and degree of openness to LGBTQI community members/'queer' or alternative approaches to liturgy etc. 

Academic (faculty and students) See relevant section of the Je-S form for more detail re impact. Partners in the project have significant international connections (e.g Canada/ South Africa/ America civil society and HEIs) which means that potential exists for subsequent follow-up faith/identity projects. 

Policy community (e.g individuals/groups focused on equalities/well-being, including the EHRC) will be able to draw upon the more general discussions/outputs with regard to the implications and impacts of intersectional exclusion of LGBTQI members of minority ethnic/faith communities resulting from heteronormative expectations. It is anticipated that health and wellbeing policy and practice teams may find the data around social isolation and impacts of 'enforced loss/rejection' of some elements of community for 'out' LGBTQI faith group members (as well as information in relation to the impact of potentially competing identities as LGBTQI/member of a faith community) relevant in terms of supporting clients around faith/religious identity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>72263</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of five short films created which illustrate the Jewish LGBTQI ritual year. These are all available on the Ritual Reconstructed website. For security reasons given that participants may be regarded as potentially being at risk as individuals who are LGBTQI and Jewish - we require a form of simple registration on the Ritual Reconstructed website to view these products produced by CI Searle Kochberg of the University of Portsmouth and his team of students. The five films (illustrative notes are linked to the films on the website and also available via the 'publications' link on ResearchFish) deal with the following themes:

FILM 1 Transgender Day of Remembrance
FILM 2 AIDS Memorial Day
FILM 3 Queer Purim Spiel (and FILM 4 follow-on focus group on camp/ Jewish ritual/queer performance)

Brighton Conference on visual methods (September 2015)
Final Project Showcase (November 2015) Jewish and LGBTQI audiences
LGBTQI History month screenings (University of Portsmouth, 3/2/16) - student/staff audience
LGBTQI History month screening (Buckinghamshire New University, 5/2/16) - staff, student, external equalities officers
Italian international seminar (University of Foggia) on LGBTQI and Faith communities - 17/2/16 - academics, community activities, state and regional equalities teams professionals, students.

Debate has overwhelmingly focused on the specificity of the Jewish LGBTQI experience and how this varies from other Abrahamic faiths in relation to interpretations of theology; scope for transfer of techniques used in the films; well-being impacts of giving 'voice' to potentially marginalised communities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5c2379f16e8.81608450</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Ritual Reconstructed Outputs (Film of the Ritual Year)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ritualreconstructed.com/category/rr-outputs-notes-to-videos/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Within the Ritual Bricolage elements of the website can be found artwork; poems; music and blogs created by participants to explore their LGBTQI and Jewish identities</gtr:description><gtr:id>10E771D9-D04B-4C26-9146-375CF31FF606</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2015-2016 and some additional materials are still being received as we are deliberately leaving this element of the website open for additional contributions.

To date a seminar has been held which attracted significant local attention on Italy and a series of contacts have been made in relation to developing both the network and future collaborations further (the activities only commenced in November 2015). Additional contacts (academic and community) are being established in Hungary; Spain and Italy with the intent of expanding the network further and identifying research sites and cross-disciplinary input (e.g. interest has been identified amongst colleagues working in the fields of theology and psychology) .</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Middlesex University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Follow on collaboration with existing and new CC partners - 'Connected Communities' Catalyst Fund workshop application</gtr:description><gtr:id>6436F7C2-7E3D-4388-ACB4-ED0C90B58E54</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not at present although we are discussing the potential for joint conferences/presentations/publications</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9929e658369.76941255-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>We have had a series of collaborative meetings with colleagues from Middlesex University to explore the potential for expanding upon our discrete research into LGBT community building.

A number of extremely interesting discussions arose in relation to techniques of anthropological film-making, Judaism and Jewish denominational practice and an extended discussion on issues around transitioning as a community member (trans-woman) discussed her journey spiritually and as she transitioned from male to female, exploring and explaining disconnection and reconnection with her faith (Orthodox Judaism) as she underwent the journey. Equalities officers in the audience found this particularly helpful and reported that they would be able to use information provided to support trans students. The community member who participated has also been able to pass on and disseminate information to support students and has agreed to act as a role model/contact point if required for students of any faith or belief (or none) who wish to speak to a professional in a senior position who has gone through the process of gender reassignment.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5d32775a688.48000592</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ritualreconstructed.com/ritual-reconstructed-research-documentary-to-be-screened-at-bucks-new-university-for-lgbt-history-month/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Team Member Knan - presenting at external facing event on Supporting Refugees and Asylum Seekers (hosted by Bucks New University)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6FF24B34-FDDC-4534-95F6-E6074D204D53</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BNU hosted a half day/evening event on supporting Refugees and Asylum seekers.

Significant support was afforded by local and regional Government and the University of Foggia - for example the seminar was introduced by the Dean - and local and regional politicians attended this event.

The event was hosted by community partners JW3 (The London Jewish Cultural Centre) who joined the project part-way through as a result of the reports on our activities and provided support in kind by providing reduced price 'state of the art' premises and screening/media equipment and intensive publicity about the event through their media outlets. http://ritualreconstructed.com/event/ritual-reconstructed-end-of-project-event/

The event was public although had to be booked in advance to ensure security for LGBTQI Jewish participants at a time of heightened security. The day long activities consisted of :

- an exhibition of photographs, objects etc collated as part of the Ritual Reconstructed event (e.g. bricolage and photo-documentary) followed by discussion sessions with participants and the gathering of reflections on outputs; 
- performances (story-telling; poetry; performance; song etc. ) by participants (including the read-through premiere of a new play by award-winning playwright Stephen Laughton 'Run' about being Gay and Jewish, which has since won critical acclaim at it's first full public run commencing February 2016; http://www.jewishnews.co.uk/review-run-the-vault/)
- a theological discussion on 'queering Halakah [Jewish law]' in which leading progressive Rabbis took part in a debate on traditional and progressive interpretations of liturgy and text and how to ensure meaningful inclusion of LGBTQI Jewish congregants
- a screening of the entire 5 film sequence concluding with a Q&amp;amp;A session with the PI and CI's Knan and Kochberg and audience members.

The entire end of project showcase event was filmed and an edited version of the day's event is available on the Ritual Reconstructed website at: http://ritualreconstructed.com/ritual-reconstructed-end-of-project-films/ 

Approximately 70 people participated in the day's events (excluding film crew and technicians/JW3 staff) some only attending for certain elements others staying for the entire day. In addition we have logged around 40 views on the website although it is not possible to know if these are the same or additional viewers. As such we have estimated the audience reached at this point although it is anticipated that this figure will increase as the films of the final event are viewed over time.

We continue to develop activities and engage with community and academic partners in the UK and beyond 


As anticipated when this project was first commenced, there is likely to be a relatively slow lead-in until maximum impact is achieved. However, since the mid-point of the project (summer 2015) we have been approached as a team to engage in both public community dissemination reaching across Jewish denominations; and internationally, to raise the issue of LBTQI Jewish identities in a public forum. Inevitably much of the publicity has been associated with events such as Pride Month (June 2015 in particular, although we expect another resurgence of interest in June 2016 also and will update on this in the next reporting period). Team members from both academic and community partners (Knan and Greenfields) have been participated by invitation in international radio broadcasts (supporting information and news outputs have been uploaded onto the Ritual Reconstructed website and can be viewed at: http://ritualreconstructed.com/) and events to enable recognition in the UK and Israel of the ground-breaking work being undertaken on this project. In addition, emerging in part from the interest generated by the RR project and the involvement of a number of our community collaborators in a simultaneous photographic exhibition project (unrelated in terms of funding but with some cross overs as a result of Community Investigator Knan's key role) on LGBTQI Jews; as well as the fortunate coincidence that LGBTQI History Month in 2016 was themed around religion and faith; the team have been invited to participate in a themed 'Queer Purim' event at the London Jewish Museum in March 2016 http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/whats-on?item=717. This event will include screening of clips from the 'Purim Spiel' film made for the RR project and a discussion on how Jewish identity is represented in religious and cultural contexts. The event will be covered extensively by the mainstream Jewish press. In addition, and emerging from debates at the 'final showcase' event on the 24th November 2015 (and requests made at that time by audience members/participants) - the RR team are in advanced negotiation with inter-faith networks in relation to holding an inter-faith theological debate on the role and engagement of theological constructs with LGBTQI identities and how varying faith groups can engage with LGBTQI communities which is anticipated to take place in late April or early May 2016. 
Additional impacts will develop in the coming months - in particular we would note that at the time of this first submission (February 2016) a policy briefing on well-being/faith and LGBTQI identity is still under preparation/review. Whilst aimed initially/predominantly at the Jewish community this briefing will have resonance also for other Abrahamic faiths and will be utilised within the planned interfaith discussion referred to above.
 
On particularly impressive impact has been the development (at early stages as yet) of a feminism Jewish/queer performance group as lesbian participants in the project have used their arts based input to the project to begin to develop poems, performances and narratives which they wish to bring to a wider audience which will enable representation of lesbian, feminist, Jewish identities through performance mediums.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C994F254-6E5C-435B-BBE2-5359418BF245</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d5aae81c56a1.74769396</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Whilst the information recorded below remains essentially similar as can be seen from our updated report we have been not only actively involved in ongoing dissemination but have also had an increase in external facing engagement with 'other' teams of researchers; and practice focused engagement for example input to development of university projects, input to Athena Swan applications re trans policies and development of ongoing links with LGBT migrant/refugee organisations. This is in part through spin out activities associated with members of our team such as the successful application by Shaan (supported by Greenfields) for the Rainbow Pilgrims study funded by the Heritage Lottery. This project draws upon lessons learnt in part through RR in relation to people of faith and migration trajectories.
In terms of publications and other activities such as applications for folow-on funding it has been a very slow year as Greenfields was unexpectedly hospitalised and required surgery in July and was only able to return to work on a phased recovery very late in the year. In addition Milne (CI) was also hospitalised and off work for some time late in 2016 limiting her involvement very significantly in later elements of the project whilst Kochberg was very focused on his doctoral research from mid 2016 to present. We intend to return to producing publications etc in 2017.



Whilst we are still expanding and exploring themes which have emerged from this study (and are involved in ongoing discussions with community participants) the key elements which have emerged are as follows:
- The strength of Jewish LGBTQI identities (ie both 'Jewish' and 'LGBTQI') and desire by participants to be able to openly acknowledge a hybridised identity which incorporates and celebrates both faith/cultural identity and sexual orientation.
- The central role of Progressive Rabbinic authorities and individual Rabbis in supporting LGBTQI equality in both community spaces and liturgical usage/theological debate. nb future impacts/outputs will build upon findings and experiences of the theological roundtable 'queering Halakah' discussion held in November 2015 in which Rabbis who are members of Liberal Judaism participated in an audience discussion. nb Liberal Judaism is a full partner in the RR project. 
- An additional emergent stream of findings consists of narratives of migration influenced by LGBTQI identity and the impacts on both individual and community development of such intra and inter-national migration. 
- The potential inherent in interpretative liturgy and religious text/theological documents to ensure inclusivity of LGBTQI people of faith - and that dependent upon context/audience such use of liturgy can be 'mainstreamed' - a theme which is emerging within the policy briefing/theology paper under review/amendment at time of submission of this return (February 2016) 
- The value and potential for usage of arts and humanities techniques in foregrounding multiple identities and enabling and illustrating an exploration of complex themes and activities
- The variability depending on faith orientation (e.g. for 'secularists' and some people of other Abrahamic faiths discussions on combining LGBTQI/Faith identities are outwith common discourse in community settings) and indeed denominational approach in relation to how and where LGBTQI identities are able to be discussed and presented.
- The impact on wellbeing of 'having a space space' and being able to identify publicly as LGBTQI and a person of faith. nb: a significant number of participants referred to depression/mental health impacts associated with having to 'choose' between religious identity and/or their identity as someone who is LGBTQI
- The impact of feminism on Jewish lesbian identities and relationship to social action/ being 'out'
- Gendered differences in how and where an individual felt safe in being 'out' as a Jewish LGBTQI person
- That migration as a theme was a surprisingly strong element of LGBTQI Jewish identities - even for those participants whose families had been residence in the UK for a number of generations. Thus connections to place of origin/diaspora; sense of home; ability to be 'out' in country/location of origin varied but were often associated with 'journeys' in LGBTQI identity as well as 'Jewish/faith journeys' 
- The connection in discourse and perceptions amongst participants in relation to social justice and LGBTQI identities
- The value placed on the development of 'new rituals' - as shown on film in the Ritual Reconstructed website by participants as 'reconstructed ritual' enabled the celebration/commemoration of entwined LGBTQI and Jewish identities. 
- The degree of interest in the overall project within the Jewish world (including some Orthodox participants) as evidenced by invitations to present our activities as leading Jewish venues such as the Jewish Museum London; JW3 (Jewish community centre who became additional community partners part-way through the project) and some coverage in the Jewish press. In addition, project members have been invited to speak on RR in Israel and Italy demonstrating international interest. Website views have emanated from as far afield as Germany, Hungary, Italy and Spain and we have received emails from Australia and America congratulating us on the initiative indicating the scope for further development.
- That there is a real potential for utilising performance and arts based activities to build and strengthen community where there is exclusion or disconnection. (see below under Impact re emergent feminist Jewish performance arts groups which has come into being amongst participants in the project) 
- That there is a developing interest in hosting a touring exhibition of outputs from the project (films/photographs) with several synagogues; some student unions - contact made during LGBTQI History Month 2016 - and Jewish community centres entering into discussion on such activities. Exhibitions are expected to take place in 2016-2017</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We still need for complete a number of publications as outlined in the initial application - for example journal papers which will explore in more depth themes which arose during activities and through re-analysis of focus group data etc.
Outputs will therefore continue to be uploaded to the website (address given above) in line with the commitment included in the original funding application. 

Whilst key findings are given above, we feel that there is particular scope to expand/develop on themes of the impact of a separation from culture and heritage and depths of exclusion experienced by LGBTQI people of faith when they feel cut off from their religious identity as a result of conflicting expectations and social identities. We will be expanding upon wellbeing and health outputs in terms of publications and also within anticipated follow-up activities and consider that colleagues might also wish to interrogate faith/wellbeing and sexual orientation in future projects given the prevalence of discourse on psychological wellbeing/ill-being which arose within discourse on exclusion and (re) connection. 
In particular we will seek to develop inter-faith initiatives to examine the scope for transfer of knowledge and collaborative developments with Muslim and Christian counterparts and would suggest that elements of inter-faith cross-cultural transfer of concepts could be expanded upon by others.
One theme which has proved of great interest albeit outside of our anticipated remit, was the influence of feminism (2nd wave/1970s) on Jewish lesbian women influencing both their challenging of gendered expectations and roles as well as political and social action activities and this may be of interest to historians who wish to collaborate on such a project with team members or independently.

We have been approached by colleagues working on a (large grant) AHRC project stream around Empowering Design and will be exploring the potential to engage further around issues of space, place, identity and communities of interest - particularly Jewish social justice beliefs - drawing upon findings and narratives which have arisen tangentially within this project. 

We will be applying to the AHRC for follow up funding to pursue a number of emergent themes outlined above and under 'key findings' and intend to work with community participants to co-develop future applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CCBD34C9-B594-48D7-B54A-7229030CC63B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d5b55e8640e7.66476104</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ritualreconstructed.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Dedicated website for the project.
