However there are a number of well recognised potential adverse health effects of MRI related to forces on ferromagnetic objects, radio-frequency heating and peripheral nerve stimulation due to time varying fields. These effects are well controlled for both patients and staff, and there are several standards from regulatory bodies worldwide which deal with magnetic and electric fields and their hazards. However there is a paucity of data on other biological effects of the EMFs involved in MRI, although is no evidence that they have a detrimental effect on health. There are acute effects such as metallic taste and dizziness around high field MRI magnet installations, but there is no evidence that these have any consequence for health. Recently the European Union agreed to postpone its 2004 directive on electromagnetic fields in the workplace, which would have compromised clinical and research uses of MRI. The limits proposed in the legislation had little or no scientific basis particularly in the frequency ranges employed in MRI. It is therefore essential that new research is carried out which will assist in setting regulatory levels so that patients receive a satisfactory level of care without endangering operators of the equipment.This proposed research builds on the applicants' recent work in modelling and measuring the electric fields induced in the human body (due to magnetic fields) and understanding the effects on the whole body. So far there has been no verification of the numerical models used to calculate body currents by experimental measurement. This will be carried out by simulating the fields induced in a particular subject during movements in the magnetic field and during gradient switching and then measuring, by experiment, the surface electric fields using newly developed dipole probes. Having verified the models, four specific experiments will be carried out. These are: 1) Measure and model electric fields at the site of peripheral nerve stimulation, PNS. This measurement will lead to a better understanding of the process of PNS and allow a future scanner operator to optimise scan parameters for imaging speed whilst avoiding PNS. Currently PNS is avoided by setting conservative limits which can compromise imaging quality. 2) Modelling of head electric currents produced by galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and by movements in magnetic fields. Direct comparison of the magnitudes and direction of induced and direct currents will support the hypothesis that the vertigo effect is mediated by an induced electric field.3) Measure subjects' sensitivity to vertigo during movements in magnetic fields and correlate it with the sensitivity of their balance system to GVS. A positive correlation will indirectly support the hypothesis that the vertigo effect is produced by stimulation of the peripheral vestibular system.4) Comparison of vestibular-evoked oculomotor responses produced by GVS with those produced by movements in magnetic fields to test directly the hypothesis that the vertigo effect is produced by stimulation of the peripheral vestibular system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>119199</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have made major contributions towards a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of vertigo that can be experienced by operators and patients in and around MRI scanners. The key findings to emerge from this research are:
? The vertigo is most likely caused by stimulation of the vestibular system of the inner ear. 
? Contrary to our initial expectations, we have demonstrated that the mechanism of vestibular stimulation does not rely upon movement within the field or gradient magnetic fields.
? The mechanism is compatible with stimulation of the vestibular system by a homogeneous, static magnetic field causing fluid (endolymph) flow in the semicircular canals under the action of Lorentz forces. This movement of the endolymph mimics natural stimulation of the semicircular canals and gives rise to apparent rotation of the body (vertigo) and involuntary eye movements (nystagmus).
? We constructed a mathematical model of the Lorentz forces and their theoretical impact on fluid flow and pressure changes inside a realistic 3-D model of the vestibular labyrinth. The model predictions were in agreement with empirical data.
? We developed methods to quantify both the vertigo and nystagmus experienced by participants inside a high-field (7 Tesla) MRI scanner. 
? The phenomena of vertigo and nystagmus have different properties related to their respective directions of rotation and adaptation with time.
? The directions and magnitudes of vertigo and nystagmus depend on head position with respect to the magnetic field. In the case of vertigo, the direction is modified further by contextual factors. When lying in the scanner, the vertigo is minimised with the neck flexed by about 20 degrees.
? Apparent differences between vertigo and nystagmus can be reconciled to invoke a common mode of stimulation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this research may be used in the future:
? To understand and minimise the discomfort associated with vertigo in patients and operators in a high-field MRI environment.
? To develop a novel physiological tool for investigating peripheral and central mechanisms of vestibular processing in health and disease.
? To inform the interpretation of neuroscience experiments that rely upon the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>11515E39-FF56-482D-A607-665B39B8147B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e040a6968693.71124181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Model of cupular pressure caused by endolymph flow through Lorentz forces produced by high-field magnets in MRI environment.</gtr:description><gtr:id>72801B23-7471-4263-BFA1-1ECAF0C7CD8A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460fcb707c147.44653714</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Lorentz force model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Assessment of perceptual effects arising from vestibular stimulation by high-field magnets inside MRI machine.</gtr:description><gtr:id>965C8CE3-7837-415B-8FA4-ECC1800C97CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460fc1b684c04.39736677</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Magnetic vestibular stimulation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4829F1E2-FA4B-46C3-BA51-A947A6FE4CCA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effect of head pitch and roll orientations on magnetically induced vertigo.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/23f623585dfe2bdb2ec0e3f6cd3111f6"><gtr:id>23f623585dfe2bdb2ec0e3f6cd3111f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mian OS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-3751</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d70280b68ae1.85879904</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4052B0C4-DC3D-4797-AEC6-F5A9F42FBCC3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Magnetic field effects on the vestibular system: calculation of the pressure on the cupula due to ionic current-induced Lorentz force.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physics in medicine and biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae83d30c1754fb67d1415d912ed5d8fe"><gtr:id>ae83d30c1754fb67d1415d912ed5d8fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Antunes A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9155</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_14165_25_22722424</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>96FA2E76-8253-44DE-B0F1-B3867D50BD9C</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the vertigo due to static magnetic fields.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/23f623585dfe2bdb2ec0e3f6cd3111f6"><gtr:id>23f623585dfe2bdb2ec0e3f6cd3111f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mian OS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5457a710c0c1a1.49376173</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>662F3CF7-079F-4431-8606-BD0109CD6EBD</gtr:id><gtr:title>A dynamic model of the eye nystagmus response to high magnetic fields.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physics in medicine and biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c1e60a6340df67ccd5c2836d095ff61"><gtr:id>7c1e60a6340df67ccd5c2836d095ff61</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Glover PM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9155</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5457a55c522235.69673916</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C62C45FC-2E40-49DC-BAE9-96DB704C6A97</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reconciling Magnetically Induced Vertigo and Nystagmus.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in neurology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/23f623585dfe2bdb2ec0e3f6cd3111f6"><gtr:id>23f623585dfe2bdb2ec0e3f6cd3111f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mian OS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-2295</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d702807ce6a0.15314661</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G061653/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp;
