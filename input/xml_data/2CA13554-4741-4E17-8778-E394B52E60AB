Mitochondria are however also involved in many other metabolic processes that implicate the participation of both intra- and extra-mitochondrial pathways. The mitochondrial inner membrane is of a particular interest since it not only contains important protein complexes, like the respiratory chain and the ATP-synthase, but also many metabolite carrier proteins and ion channels catalysing the transport of various molecules. Our knowledge of the protein composition of the mitochondrial inner membrane is still largely incomplete. Recent protein mass spectrometry studies (proteomics) provided a first insight into the protein compositions (proteomes) of the mitochondrial inner membranes from different eukaryotes. However, the used model eukaryotes are exclusively derived from the 'crown'-group of the evolutionary tree, including fungi, plants and mammals, whereas virtually nothing is known about the mitochondrial proteomes from more 'primitive' eukaryotes, like for example protozoa. Kinetoplastid protozoa branched very early in evolution and are the lowest-branching order of eukaryotes to possess 'true' mitochondria. The best-studied kinetoplastid protozoan (model organism) is Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of 'African sleeping sickness' - a detrimental human disease for which no vaccines are available and existing drug treatments are toxic or expensive. Trypanosomes are transmitted by insect vectors, and have a complex life cycle alternating between the bloodstream-form in the blood and tissue fluids of the mammalian host, and the procyclic-form in the midgut of the insect vector. The mitochondrion of the trypanosome exhibits several unique features, and its structure and function varies dramatically depending on the life-cycle stage of the parasite. In the bloodstream-form, mitochondria are relatively underdeveloped, lack key enzymes and co-factors needed for mitochondrial energy generation, and are therefore often considered as 'non-functional'. For energy (ATP) generation, the bloodstream-form trypanosome relies completely on glycolysis, which is partly compartmentalised in a unique peroxisome-related microbody, called the glycosome. In contrast, the procyclic-form trypanosome contains more elaborate mitochondria, and molecular and biochemical studies showed the presence of several functional mitochondrial pathways. They gain most of their energy (ATP) during the mitochondrial degradation of proline, an amino acid readily available in the insect vector. Several studies have provided evidence that the trypanosome mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to several metabolites, implying the presence of specific transporters. Evidently, our understanding of the remarkable trypanosome mitochondrial metabolism would be vastly enhanced if we knew more about the protein composition of the mitochondrial inner membrane proteome and the metabolite transporters it contains. Main objectives of the proposed research are (A) to determine the exact protein composition of the T. brucei mitochondrial inner membrane by protein mass spectrometry, and (B) the identification and functional characterisation of the metabolite transporters it contains. The obtained results would (1) facilitate - for the first time - the comparison of mitochondrial inner membrane proteomes from trypanosome to man, (2) be invaluable for the general understanding of the structure, function and evolution of mitochondria, and (3) provide more insight into the remarkable mitochondria of T. brucei. The outcomes of the proposed research would not only benefit scientists working on various aspects of T. brucei mitochondria or those working on mitochondria from higher eukaryotes like humans, but would also benefit the people (and cattle) affected by this disease through the identification of novel putative drug targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Objective of this proposal is to improve our understanding of the structure and function of the mitochondrial inner membrane from Trypanosoma brucei. In preliminary experiments, bloodstream-form and procyclic-form T. brucei cell lines have been generated expressing epitope-tagged MCP5, an abundant mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) protein. From these cell lines, intact mitochondria are isolated using differential and iodixanol density gradient centrifugation. Immuno- or affinity-purification will be used to isolate mitochondrial inner membranes (MIMs) with the MCP5 epitope-tag as antigen or ligand, respectively. The isolated MIMs are assessed by western blot analysis and enzyme assays for purity/contamination. Possible contaminations from other subcellular compartments will be removed by high-salt washes and/or carbonate extraction. Alternatively, membrane proteins will be specifically enriched from mitochondria or MIMs using detergent or organic solvent extraction. Membrane proteins will be separated by 1-D SDS-PAGE and 2-D16-BAC/SDS PAGE, and identified by nanoHPLC-ESI-QTOF mass spectrometry. The encoding genes will be cloned, and their sequences analyzed for homology, and conserved structures and motives. The mitochondrial inner membrane localisation of the identified proteins will be confirmed by epitope-tagged expression and immunolocalisation studies in both studied life cycle forms of T. brucei. Putative metabolite transporters (initially MCF proteins) will be selected and their requirement for trypanosome survival tested by the generation of conventional or conditional double knockout cell lines, which will be extensively analyzed. His-tagged metabolite transporters will be expressed in Escherichia coli (or by in vitro expression), affinity-purified, and reconstituted into liposomes for transport assays. Substrate specificity and a complete set of kinetic parameters will be obtained for each selected metabolite transporter.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>223477</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>African trypanosomes like Trypanosoma brucei
gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense cause 'African sleeping sickness', a detrimental human
disease for which no vaccines are available and existing drug treatments are toxic or expensive. 
The trypanosome energy metabolism is regarded as a potential source of novel drug targets. So far, almost nothing is known about the composition and function of the mitochondrion in bloodstream form (BSF) T. brucei. Previously published work suggests that the mitochondrion of BSF T. brucei is &amp;quot;non-functional&amp;quot;, with no or only a few putative functional roles. It was further suggested that this organelle does not contribute to the cellular energy metabolism (ATP production) in BSF T. brucei. 

Objective of this grant was to investigate the suggested &amp;quot;non-functional&amp;quot; nature and (membrane) protein composition of the BSF T. brucei mitochondrion. For this purpose mitochondrial fractions were isolated from BSF T. brucei, which were further analysed by protein mass spectrometry. 

The outcome of our proteomic analyses resulted in the identification of novel functions and physiological roles for the BSF T. brucei mitochondrion. Its total mitochondrial proteome was found to be substantially smaller then the one published for procyclic form T. brucei. Key findings of our proteomic analysis include the identification and mitochondrial presence of: (A) different metabolite transporters, including various members of the mitochondrial carrier family (TbMCPs), (B) majority of enzymes of the TCA-cycle, (C) different amino acid biosynthesis pathways, (D) enzymes of the trypanothione-tryparedoxin oxidative stress defence system, and (E) enzymes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis. Using these proteomic data, we were able to generate a comprehensive model of the mitochondrial metabolism in BSF T. brucei. 

An additional important key finding resulting from our mitochondrial metabolic model is that BSF mitochondria are capable of ATP production via substrate-level phosphorylation. ATP-production assays with different metabolic substrates and isolated BSF T. brucei mitochondria confirmed that these organelles are indeed capable of a net ATP production, and thus can potentially contribute to the total energy (ATP) production in BSF T. brucei. 

Overall, our results clearly contradict the previously published suggestion that the BSF mitochondrion is essentially &amp;quot;non-functional&amp;quot;.

In addition, we further identified and functionally characterised 3 different metabolite carriers of the T. brucei mitochondrial inner membrane, i.e. TbMCP5 (prototypical ADP/ATP carrier), TbMCP11 (phosphate carrier), and TbMCP12 (novel plant-type di/tricarboxylate carrier). Specific metabolite transport functions were confirmed by heterologous complementation of yeast knockout strains and in vitro transport-coupled mitochondrial ATP-production assays. Gene knockout/knockdown studies revealed that expression of these TbMCPs is essential and required for T. brucei survival (potential drug targets).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results clearly demonstrate that the mitochondrion of bloodstream form T. brucei (human infective form) is functional (performing multiple essential physiological roles) and that this organelle is most probably essential for trypanosome survival. The identified (novel) mitochondrial pathways can serve as a source for the identification of novel and more effective drug targets required for the treatment of trypanosomiasis (which is lethal when not treated) . Our results do further contribute to the fundamental/general understanding of the essential energy metabolism in this important human parasite. Our findings are important for other researchers working on trypanosomiasis and the development of new and effective chemotherapeutic treatments of Trypanosomiasis. 
In long term, our results would be useful for the pharmaceutical industry and the affected patients (healthcare).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EFFB66A4-6215-4F8C-8C41-ED1037A89359</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b99e24238b3.37771017</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D7433508-C9E6-4990-A41B-A23402BDD80E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mitochondrial carrier family inventory of Trypanosoma brucei brucei: Identification, expression and subcellular localisation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular and biochemical parasitology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/09fa6cfa6aec15aebfc6b3baf80d39b0"><gtr:id>09fa6cfa6aec15aebfc6b3baf80d39b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Colasante C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0166-6851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54195cea327d62.70036342</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B6AE7145-B69E-40E9-8EB3-F1BA59A87F9B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Functional characterization of TbMCP5, a conserved and essential ADP/ATP carrier present in the mitochondrion of the human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ee57c88eb747a089e2216852fb658f11"><gtr:id>ee57c88eb747a089e2216852fb658f11</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pe?a-Diaz P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54195ce9b43600.51894938</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G00448X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
