The IU-ATC project represents the largest collaboration of its kind between UK and India and as such provides a unique and internationally competitive research eco-system to be further leveraged for maximum impact. As commented by the EPSRC Review Panel that met on 15th August (i) &amp;quot;The panel were positive about the success of Phase 1 of IU-ATC, commenting that they were impressed with the achievements of the consortium so far in the face of the significant challenge of making a consortium work across numerous institutions and country boundaries.&amp;quot;, (ii) &amp;quot;The panel were clear that there is no question of the huge capacity that the IU-ATC has built over phase 1.&amp;quot; A summary of our strengths is provided in the Joint 2-page (planning for IU-ATC Phase 2) document submitted to EPSRC-DST on August 5th 2011 (attached). In summary there has been 246 international Conference Papers, 106 Journal Papers ( with 31 papers still under review), Papers under dissemination 31 , 6 Books , and 10 Technical Reports. Of particular significance are the 15 Patents Submitted, the 8 technical Prototypes built and the 12 Technical Testbeds / Demonstrators that support the work of the team in both countries. 

As we plan for Phase 2, we have reflected on our outputs to-date and also the recently published strategic research priorities from EPSRC published in July 2011 on Global Uncertainties , Healthcare, Digital Economy, E-Infrastructure, Intelligent Information Infrastructure, Working Together and DST 11th Plan, DST SAC respectively. In light of the respective national priorities for ICT Research and Innovation that have been identified by EPSRC-DST, there are a number of directly relevant &amp;quot;grand challenges&amp;quot; which we highlighted in our 2-page plan for the respective EPSRC-DST Review Committees on 5th August 2011 (attached). 


Leveraging the capacity that has been developed in IU-ATC Phase 1, we will take into consideration some of the respective national priorities areas as listed in 1..7 above and the key recommendations of the EPSRC-DST review Panels. As evidenced from the EPSRC Review Panel a specific recommendation was made that whilst we should strive to have commonality of approach between work areas in both countries we should not 'force-fit' all research activities to both countries. Given this recommendation, we have developed a plan of innovative research that attempts to address global issues, common challenges and respective national priorities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>266482</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project involved the development of sensor systems, for two purposes.

The first lies in monitoring for children. The sensor suite is capable of monitoring activity and position as well as ECG parameters, specifically heart rate variability. Elements of the suite have already been used in different projects, ranging from thermal comfort monitoring to activity mapping in Baboons on the Cape Peninsula. The system is undergoing further development for use in an enterprise-funded project to improve clinical outcomes for children with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and has also been used to provide gold standard comparisons in a project on wheelchair accessibility. An aim of the JIA project is to examine the feasibility of developing a commercialisable product, to be used in conjunction with a mobile app to allow young people with JIA to record and monitor their condition, to provide additional information to clinicians, and to monitor compliance with treatment regimes.

The second contribution from this project lies in the development and commercialisation of an education device. The Engduino&amp;reg; is a teaching tool designed in the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL), initially as a souvenir to the students who come to visit UCL for a programming taster session. 

It has 16 multicolour LEDs and a button, which can be used to provide visual feedback and simple user input. It also comes with three further components: a thermistor, capable of sensing temperature; a 3D accelerometer, which measures accelerations; and an infrared transmitter/receiver, which can be used to transmit messages from one Engduino&amp;reg; to another. 

The second and third versions of the Engduino&amp;reg; also have a light sensor and a magnetometer, and an SD card was added in the third version.

Due to its attractive appearance, easy-to-use interfaces and abundance of open source workshop materials, the Engduino&amp;reg; has proven to be very popular to secondary school teachers and students. 

The team has taken this opportunity to taken the Engduino forward to promote Computing At School, including school outreach and commercialisation of the Engduino&amp;reg;. We have successfully trademarked the name and brand of the Engduino&amp;reg;, and it is currently on sale through a social enterprise run from UCL. 

Much of the cost effective manufacturing and sourcing process have been learnt during the commercialisation. Although the aim of the Engduino&amp;reg; is to promote computing at school, the commercialisation of the product will help reduce the cost of production, and further fund any development of hardware and software educational products. 

The outreach activities of the Engduino&amp;reg; have a large impact in promoting computing in secondary schools and much has been learnt in the many workshops that we held, at UCL and other public venues. Many opportunities have arisen in the activities related to Engduino&amp;reg;, including collaboration with industrial major players including BBC, Microsoft, Mathworks, Cisco and many others.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0AE806A3-E7C7-4EC1-A5A0-64968C01D61A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463bfa94ea3e5.64618459</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>One of the primary outcomes from the work on this project was the development of a teaching tool for use in schools. The Engduino (http://www.engduino.org) is a programmable device, with a variety of sensors (light, temperature, accelerometer, magnetometer, button) and outputs (16 RGB LEDs. USB, infra-red, and micro SD card) incorporated into a single easy-to-use package. It has been widely trialled with schoolchildren and their teachers (as well as with undergraduates), and we have developed it to the point of commercialisation. The Engduino can be purchased from the website.

A further outcome was the development of a sensor capable of recording high accuracy position and activity data for children, along with sensors for ECG monitoring. These sensors are being further developed for use with children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but have been used with children, in an extended study on Baboons, and on wheelchairs. The ECG work, specifically that on heart rate variability, has been further used in a study on thermal comfort.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Engduino is in active use and is commnercially available. Both the hardware and software components of it are open.

The sensing devices are being further developed, but have already been used in a variety of projects, by engineers, medics and biologists. They will become openly available in the same way as the Engduino and a commercialisation of them in the context of Juvenile Arthritis is being pursued.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3D39F0CC-4700-421A-977A-E1A683560499</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463c2b1235669.22606918</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.engduino.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>61D9199A-4561-4B8D-97C2-29C90229F5E1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bias adjustment of spatially-distributed wireless pollution sensors for environmental studies in India</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7f6bdc8dae230bf18b97cad01f50c2f3"><gtr:id>7f6bdc8dae230bf18b97cad01f50c2f3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shum L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5463e00373c7b0.66760242</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J016721/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
