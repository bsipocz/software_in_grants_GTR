For example they might need to determine, on the basis of sentence context, whether the word ?spade? refers to a digging tool or a card suit. Despite the apparent ease with which listeners usually accomplish this task, meaning selection is known to be cognitive demanding, and is a source of particular difficultly for individuals/groups with comprehension deficits. This research explores the contribution of learning mechanisms to meaning selection in healthy adults. For example, someone who had recently taken up gardening or card-playing could potentially make meaning selection easier for ?spade? by using their recent experience to make better predictions about which meaning is likely to be encountered in the future. A combination of lab-based and web-based experiments will measure the impact of different types of experience with ambiguous words on how they are processed after a delay of minutes, days or weeks. Additional experiments will explore whether listeners take into account the speaker?s identity or accent to aid their interpretation of ambiguous words. This research will form the basis for future attempts to characterise the precise difficulties of individuals/groups with comprehension deficits.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>(i) User Groups
Understanding the meaning of ambiguous words within sentence contexts is a pre-requisite for all verbal communication: over 80% of common English words have more than one dictionary definition. Difficulties in understanding ambiguous words will necessarily have a marked impact on the ability of any individual to understand spoken and written language. Difficulties of this sort have already been identified in a wide range of clinical and non-clinical populations including adults with reading comprehension difficulties (10), children with language impairments (11) and aphasic patients (12). The primary non-academic user groups that we will target will thus be professionals involved in assessing and remediating individuals with language processing difficulties, within both educational and clinical settings. Our work will contribute to the long-term development of an effective and scientifically-informed strategy for (i) assessing the nature of the difficulties of these individuals and (ii) designing and evaluating appropriate interventions that are aimed at improving their comprehension abilities. 
The second non-academic user group will be professionals involved in second language teaching. Our discoveries about the factors that influence the likelihood that information about words and their meanings will be consolidated into long term memory will have clear relevance to professionals interested in improving outcomes for students who are learning English (and other languages) as an additional language. 

(ii) Plan for Engagement
We anticipate that the impact of our research for these users to occur in the relatively long term, but we propose the following activities to (i) facilitate networking with these communities, (ii) disseminate our results, and (iii) obtain input from these users concerning future research :
a) &amp;quot;How do we understand language&amp;quot; - a website
We will build on our existing experience in setting up a website to promote research (jennirodd.com) to set up a new website with the explicit aim of promoting interaction between academic researchers and educational/clinical practitioners on the topic of language comprehension. In Phase I (year 1 of the grant) we will focus on presenting current psycholinguistic research (from both within and outside our lab) on how healthy adults and children understand language. The focus will be presenting relatively short summaries of key findings in an accessible manner. In Phase II (years 2-3 of the grant) we will solicit additional contributions from educational/clinical practitioners (see Impact Plan).
b) &amp;quot;Language Comprehension: From Theory to Practice&amp;quot; - a workshop
This workshop will take place in the second year of the grant and will be based at UCL. The invited speakers will include researchers studying adult and child sentence comprehension within academic settings, as well as education and clinical practitioners with an interest in developing and evaluating interventions aimed at improving language comprehension (see Impact Plan). 

(iii) Additional Public Engagement
Our team has considerable experience in disseminating research to the wider public (e.g., Cheltenham Science Festival, Cambridge Science Festival, Science Museum). With the support of UCL's Public Engagement Unit (http://www.ucl.ac.uk /public-engagement/) we will continue to develop innovative methods to improve understanding of how people understand language within the wider population. For example, following on from our recent publication looking at how ambiguous words are processed within puns (13) and Dr Davis' recent debut performance at the Bright Club (www.brightclub.org), Dr Davis and Dr Rodd are currently planning a public communication of science event to be hosted at the Dana Centre at the Science Museum (http://www.danacentre.org.uk) combining comedy and the psycholinguistics of how ambiguous words are processed in both puns and normal speech.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>298855</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interviewed as part of podcast produced for the &quot;Allusionist&quot; series</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DE8F0C88-4B65-4C56-841B-04ED9C6E79C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Podcast entitled &amp;quot;This is your brain on language&amp;quot; produced by HELEN ZALTZMAN</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfeb0218d1a6.48315735</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theallusionist.org/brain</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on Social Communication</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A1C06024-0D8A-40B4-A6F9-A5D04E216A06</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented at Social Communcation Workshop.

More specifically, we investigated how listeners use past encounters with words with multiple, unrelated meanings (ambiguous words, e.g., BARK of the tree/dog) in different contexts to make it easier to understand these words in the future. We have produced four key findings.

1) Listeners use knowledge of speaker accents to guide their interpretations
A set of five experiments have shown that listeners can keep track of systematic differences in how different groups of speakers use ambiguous words (Cai et al., under revision). Specifically, British participants are sensitive to a speaker's accent, such that they are more likely to retrieve the meaning that is more common in the US (e.g., the petrol meaning of &amp;quot;gas&amp;quot;) if the word is spoken in an American accent. By varying the strength of the accent information in individual words (by morphing British- and American-accented recordings), we have shown that listeners use accent cues to determine the dialectic identity of a speaker and then use their experience of that dialect to guide meaning access for all words spoken by that person, regardless of the strength of the accent in each individual word. This mechanism makes comprehension of accented speech both faster and less errorful. Taken together, these results demonstrate that listeners determine key characteristics of a speaker and use this knowledge to guide language comprehension.

2) Listeners update their meaning representations based on their final interpretation of each word.
Listeners' preferences for word meanings can be strongly influenced by recent encounters with one of its meanings, such that the low-frequency meaning of &amp;quot;pen&amp;quot;; becomes more readily available after hearing a sentence like &amp;quot;the farmer put the sheep in the pen&amp;quot;. We compared priming for sentences where the ambiguous word occurs early in the sentence, before the critical context is given, and is thus highly likely to be misinterpreted (e.g., the PEN that the man wanted was for the SHEEP) with sentences where the listener is certain about the intended meaning of the ambiguous word at the point in time at which they encounter the word (e.g., the sheep PEN was the one that the man wanted). Experiments using two different methods (word association, speeded semantic relatedness decisions) showed equivalent priming in the two cases indicating that it is the final interpretation of the word that drives learning, and that learning is not reduced by partial activation of the 'wrong' meaning.

3) Word-Meaning Priming can occur across modalities
We have shown that listeners use their experience with printed ambiguous words to help them know which meaning is more likely. Similarly, readers make use of information from spoken language. The magnitude of these cross-modality priming effects was not significantly reduced compared with within-modality priming. This finding indicates that the lexical representations that are being changed as a consequence of experience are shared between the visual and spoken modalities.

4) Word-meaning Priming decays rapidly with time
We have shown that an encounter with an ambiguous word has a large impact on how that word is interpreted after a 2-minute delay, but this effect is substantially reduced after 20 minutes. This shows that this form of priming has a transient component that does not permanently change how these words are represented. In contrast the residual priming that remains after 20 minutes is relatively stable and does not decay further in the subsequent 20 minutes, indicating that there is an additional, more stable component to word-meaning priming, which will enhance comprehension of words that are repeated within relatively long conversations (Rodd et al., 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is well established that comprehension difficulties are evident in a wide range of clinical and non-clinical populations including both children and adults, and that these difficulties can have a life-long negative impact. Our findings confirm that ability to learn from experience is a key factor in fluent, skilled comprehension. Additional research is needed to determine the extent to which these difficulties might be caused (or exacerbated) by underlying deficits in language learning mechanisms in different groups of individuals with comprehension difficulties. If such deficits are indeed critical to explaining the comprehension difficulties of groups (or individuals), then these findings provide important insights into the nature of these learning mechanisms that will be key to developing effective and scientifically-informed interventions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D3005847-ADF8-4C39-B159-4BEFC04C7924</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546c972bdc93f5.74228020</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8A6A7818-66BE-4EDC-98C8-50A92E3FAA27</gtr:id><gtr:title>How to study spoken language understanding: a survey of neuroscientific methods</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Language, Cognition and Neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/070ed1363cadf49b9a905e4e3d060675"><gtr:id>070ed1363cadf49b9a905e4e3d060675</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rodd J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5928069c103ce2.73552933</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8AA24CD9-CD2E-4CBA-8135-834467A607FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The cognate facilitation effect in bilingual lexical decision is influenced by stimulus list composition.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta psychologica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8dae0bdeed369650c6e949fe679ef7d4"><gtr:id>8dae0bdeed369650c6e949fe679ef7d4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Poort ED</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-6918</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a350d3900ff46.49529934</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF2916EC-B712-465A-B64E-0F9A41AC6BBC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of recent and long-term experience on access to word meanings: Evidence from large-scale internet-based experiments</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Memory and Language</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/070ed1363cadf49b9a905e4e3d060675"><gtr:id>070ed1363cadf49b9a905e4e3d060675</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rodd J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675eed7d17e5</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AA73BADB-23EA-487B-A208-B738A95F813A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Accent modulates access to word meaning: Evidence for a speaker-model account of spoken word recognition.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognitive psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c81183bcfa649e6e6590cd4bab6b0d90"><gtr:id>c81183bcfa649e6e6590cd4bab6b0d90</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cai ZG</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0010-0285</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fca253f5ee3.58213058</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0433596F-155C-4ACB-8E98-54297DD1E8F0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Listeners and Readers Generalize Their Experience With Word Meanings Across Modalities.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental psychology.
