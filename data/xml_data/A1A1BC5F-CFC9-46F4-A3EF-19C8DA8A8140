disease</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Intramural</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MC_UU_12016/4</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The cells of our body are constantly exposed to potentially damaging agents from both external sources, such as the sun's harmful UV rays or pathogenic bacteria, as well as internal sources, including free radicals produced by the cell?s metabolic pathways. A key mechanism that helps us cope with this onslaught is autophagy (which literally means self eating) whereby damaged and unwanted cellular components are targeted for degradation and recycling. Recent work has indicated that impaired autophagy is linked to many diseases such as cancer, Parkinsons and tuberculosis, therefore any drug that could target this process might be advantageous in treating these diseases. The actual mechanism of autophagy remains elusive and the aim of my lab is to understand how autophagy is regulated and proceeds at the molecular level. We also aim to unravel how the disruption of autophagic pathways can lead to disease and to exploit this information to develop novel therapeutic strategies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A major focus of this research is to decipher the signals that initiate autophagy and determine how these signals trigger autophagosome formation. Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process for degrading unwanted, damaged or foreign components in eukaryotic cells. Autophagy is critical for various physiological processes such as embryonic development and establishment of self-tolerance in the immune system. Additionally, malfunction of autophagy is involved in multiple human diseases including cancer, Parkinsons and Crohns. Autophagy occurs when a small membrane cistern grows and surrounds a portion of the cytosol, eventually sealing itself to form a double-membrane vesicular structure termed an autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome then fuses with the endocytic system to deliver the internal membrane and its contents to the lysosome for degradation and recycling. Under conditions of stress, such as nutrient starvation or infection, autophagy is strongly induced, yet the signaling pathways that lead to this increase in autophagic flux are poorly understood. We recently identified a protein kinase complex that is essential for the early stages of autophagy. The complex consists of at least three proteins: the kinase ULK1 and its accessory proteins ATG13 and FIP200. Importantly, it appears that this complex acts as a signaling node to convert incoming autophagy signals into autophagosomes. We aim to identify the signaling pathways that initiate autophagy with stimuli including nutrient starvation, ER stress and innate immune responses. Using biochemical and cell biological techniques we will define how these pathways interact with the ULK1 complex and in-turn how ULK1 kinase activity is altered. Importantly, we will use this information to determine the downstream targets of ULK1 to understand how autophagy is induced. Another related focus of the lab is to determine how autophagy can target specific cellular components in the background of all others. Traditionally autophagy was seen as a non-specific pathway, with random portions of the cytosol targeted for degradation. However, recent work has shown that autophagy can target specific proteins and organelles within the cell. For example, specific targets include mitochondria, which has implications for the neurodegenerative Parkinson's disease, and intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As with proteasomal-mediated degradation, ubiquitylation appears to be the signal for autophagic turnover. We are interested in how this ubiquitylation signals to the autophagic machinery, specifically the ULK1 complex, to trigger the switch from a general, non-specific autophagy into a targeted, specific autophagy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1773000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Gurdon Institute</gtr:department><gtr:description>Steve J</gtr:description><gtr:id>FE51905D-1940-480D-956C-E0BF0E61DC4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b1bce422b0.53242191-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaborators are undertaking experimental work and contributing expertise and intellectual input..</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are undertaking experimental work and contributing expertise and intellectual input.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Merck</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Merck Serono</gtr:department><gtr:description>DSTT renewal 2016</gtr:description><gtr:id>92649976-7B1A-48FD-A85C-846B55FFAF21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During the collaboration, the Unit has helped to launch and/or accelerate many drug discovery programmes, some of which have entered human clinical trials.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy. From July 2003 to July 2008, the participating pharmaceutical companies were AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and Co, Merck-Serono and Pfizer. The collaboration was renewed for a further four years in July 2008 with five of these companies (Merck and Co leaving the consortium at this time). This collaboration was renewed for an unprecedented fourth time in July 2013 for a further four years with six pharmaceutical companies (AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Janessen Pharmaceutica), Merck-Serono and Pfizer.

GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry.

Of equal importance in these communication efforts is educational outreach to students within the Dundee community.

Thus, during session 2014 -2015 and 2015-2016 school year, the MRC-PPU will partner with a local secondary school -- Baldragon Academy (BA). Teachers in BA's Science Department will collaborate with scientists at the MRC-PPU in an educational outreach effort (see Appendix 1). The purpose of this project is to increase interest and engagement in science and related careers. It will be starting in August 2014 with the S1 pupils.

Scientists from the unit will be working with the pupils on a monthly basis at the school during their science classes and will be providing them with opportunities to take part in various science experiments and demonstrations (aligned with Scotland's Curriculum for Excellence). The scientists are leaders in their field of research and as such come from all over the world. They are currently based in Dundee.

Thus far, student have been very enthusiastic about the labs and very receptive to the volunteers. They have asked a multitude of questions and have even asked volunteers back to visit. We have also had numerous students of different ages from the school ask to participate in work experience activities to learn more about the Unit and science in general.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5679acbf1f7ba2.71218299</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Work Experience Student Visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E02DE8D-F477-4F09-8B8D-3DB90B888B27</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The goal of this work experience is to provide secondary school students with an interest in biological sciences with several 'taster sessions' focused on diverse laboratory training focused on specific topics carried out in the PPU -- which are also critical parts of molecular and cellular biochemisty.

We advertised our event through local cancer patient groups and cancer charities. 40 visitors attended including cancer survivors, current cancer patients, relatives of cancer patients, cancer charity workers and school children.
 
The day started with a general introduction to our unit and cancer research in our unit from Prof John Rouse. Prof Rouse, Dr Victoria Cowling and Dr Ian Ganley then explained their current research questions. This session was directly followed by a lively question and answer session, including discussion of our research and cancer research in general. During a refreshment break there was opportunity for more informal discussions with the Prof Rouse, Dr Cowling and Dr Ganley. At this time, lab tours were also conducted including demonstrating mass spectrometry, live cell imaging and the MRC-PPU research area. Dr Matthias Trost, Dr Thimo Kurz and Dr Yogesh Kaluthu assisted with the tours. A number of postdocs and PhD students were also involved throughout the day.
 
10 MRC staff took part in the day.
4 invitations were issued: 3 cancer patient groups and 1 cancer charity
40 visitors attended


Feedback from the visitors was positive.
100% of guests &amp;quot;completely enjoyed the event. 
There was equivalent interest in:
 - learning more about cancer research
 - meeting and chatting to scientists
 - finding out how medical research affects health
100% wanted to attend a similar event in the future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>fXDpk4FrjVg</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science-Art Tutor</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D096C731-4DAA-4D62-8AC1-7AFE4B1301FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Tutor in a course aimed at 3rd year art students who wish to develop an interest in the relationship between art and science.
