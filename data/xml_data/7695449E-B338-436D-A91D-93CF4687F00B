is a high volume crime affecting many households. As well as substantial financial loss and damage to property, it causes high levels of anxiety about the possibility of being burgled. Surveys documenting public priorities about crime place burglary at the top. Burglar alarms and other security devices in principle deter potential burglars. Insurance premiums are discounted when a fully operating burglar alarm exists in the home due to claims about the effectiveness of burglar alarms and other security devices in the marketing literature, but no systematic research studies have been undertaken to assess their effectiveness in different areas, accommodation types and occupants? characteristics. The primary research question of this project: 'Which burglary security devices work for whom and in what context?' is precisely addressing this issue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study will identify the individual and combined security devices that offer cost-effective burglary protection to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the population in England and Wales overall&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>specific population subgroups according to their socio-economic attributes&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the residents of Wales, each of the nine English regions and area types according to population socio-demographic profile and density&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>area types and population subgroups plausible combinations. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>To this end it will analyse multiple sweeps of the British Crime Survey and respective Census data via advanced statistical analysis.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Burglary has both financial and intangible costs to individuals, local communities and society in general. Costs include, for example, immediate losses, damage to property, distress and days lost from work. This research has been designed to inform future policy guidelines in ways that could lead to considerable financial savings and produce direct benefits to the following groups: 
- Local authorities as housing providers and as responsible members of Crime Reduction Partnerships, working more effectively and efficiently to discharge their responsibilities 
- Private and housing association landlords, working more effectively and efficiently to improve security of tenants 
- Victims and repeat victims of burglary, by informing them of how best to reduce their future risks
- All households, by informing them of cost effective security investments
- The insurance industry, by enabling them to offer incentives for households who actively seek to reduce their risk by taking effective security measures; 
- The security industry, by enabling them to improve products and better target them according to clients' socio-economic and area profiles
- Public information by suggesting improvements to the household security questions of the Crime Prevention Module of the British Crime Survey; and 
- Public policy by informing the Department for Communities and Local Government on minimum standards for home security. 

In an indirect way the proposed research will also benefit: 
- The police, by reducing workloads (and thus costs) through reduced burglary and by enabling more informed advice to be given to community members on general and burglary victims in particular
- The society at large, by reducing burglary and its impact; 
- The economy, via increased tax revenues (from the decline of illegal markets due to weak stolen products' supplies). 

Public engagement at the start-up, intermediate and final stages of the proposed research has been planned to maximise its impact to all research users groups (see Pathways to Impact). In addition users from the public and voluntary sectors will be actively involved in the development of the research throughout its duration via the work of high ranking representatives who have agreed to participate in the Advisory Committee (see Pathways to Impact, Case for Support and Project Partners). 

Criminology is currently undersupplied with trained secondary data analysts. This is a particular problem: there is a wealth of existing large and complex datasets. Their deeper examination would offer invaluable theoretical insights and assist crime prevention and criminal justice policy. An important outcome from our research will be to increase that capacity within criminology via employing an RA from another discipline and training her /him to undertake secondary data and advanced statistical analyses on the British Crime Survey data. 

As seen in their respective CVs members of the research team already enjoy close contacts with and serve in bodies responsible for crime measurement and prevention. They are thus accustomed to communicating findings to non-specialists in ways that draw out their policy and practice significance. Past work has already had a substantial impact. For example, Farrell's work on repeat victimisation has found its way into routine policy and practice. Grove's recent work on heritage crime has received substantial media coverage. Tseloni's work has played a pivotal part in official reports of crime statistics and patterns. Tilley wrote the original guidance for analysis for the Crime and Disorder Act (Hough and Tilley 1998) and his work on problem-oriented policing and partnership has likewise had a substantial impact on the work of local police services and partnerships.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152656</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Surrey</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Mechanical Engineering Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Journal article from collaboration with H.

The public and voluntary sector organisations which contributed to the project via the AC included the following:

? National Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), former and current Burglary ACPO Leads, and police forces who fed back findings to the police; 
? ACPO Secured by Design, Home Office's Designing Out Crime team, and the Centre for Applied Science and Technology's Crime Prevention and Community Safety team who dealt with issues of building design, security-related building regulations, social and private rented property standards, accreditation and general crime prevention policies;
? Neighbourhood and Home Watch Network for England and Wales, and Victim Support, who both provided feedback to home owners/victims, and endorsed the WIDE protection approach;
? Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership (NCDP), Nottingham City Homes, and Nottinghamshire Police who in collaboration with the project's PI piloted the findings (see next) with the view to rolling them out as minimum security standards requirements for social and private rented property across the city and dealt with security upgrades to the city's social housing; and
? Office for National Statistics, who received feedback on BCS/CSEW questionnaire design improvements for gauging additional information on security, guardianship and burglary victimisation nationally.

In addition to the Advisory Committee of Stakeholders and Experts (see above) the project team employed the following collaborative and engagement mechanisms:

? Briefing Notes, Summary Reports and Press Releases;
? Briefing Notes and Summary Reports; 
? Blog and Twitter accounts for continuous postings/opinion exchanges; 
? Radio/TV interviews, newspaper postings, articles in practitioners newsletters and magazines;
? Oral Evidence on the crime drop taken before the House of Commons Justice Committee on 'Crime reduction policies: A co-ordinated approach?'(28.1.2014) 
? Participation in Local Crime and Safety Partnerships Board meetings;
? Presenting findings in (non-academic) practitioners/policy conferences;
? Public responses to the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) consultation on planning and building regulations; 
? Working with national policy representatives and in designing the Nottingham target hardening pilot based upon the project's methodology and findings (see below &amp;amp; next section); and
? One-day end of project non-academic conference (see later discussion).

The research increased the effectiveness of public services and policy via cost-effective crime prevention, enhanced quality of life via crime and fear of crime reduction, and contributed to improving the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom via applying the same innovative methodology to shop theft and other property crimes. 

The following discussion details the impact generated from this research to date:

One immediate impact is changing the attitudes of the police forces, crime and safety partnerships, and the voluntary organisations which participated in the Advisory Committee, such as the Neighbourhood and Home Watch Network (NHWN), ACPO Burglary Lead, the Home Office and Victim Support, with regards to recommending burglar alarms as an effective anti-burglary device.

The research evidence for the effectiveness of Secured by Design (SBD) standard provided by the AC and the Investigators to the DCLG's planning and building regulations review (summer 2013) influenced the DCLG new planning and building regulations which retained the SBD standard.

As mentioned, the findings were used for a target hardening pilot project in Nottingham, a demonstration project to implement and test the effectiveness of the window and door locks, internal and external lights (WIDE) security combination recommended by the research as the most effective and 'best value' combination. The pilot was led by the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership (NCDP) involving local police and housing services. Drawing on the research's findings and the theory of repeat and near repeat victimisation, the pilot project undertook a randomised experiment across four appropriately selected areas of Nottingham. The NCDP offered free of charge WIDE security upgrades to the burgled properties as well as up to 20 houses surrounding the targeted property to the side, front and back in the test areas. After an initial visit and assessment by the Crime Prevention Team the work was undertaken by the city council's ALMO housing provider, Nottingham City Homes, using Secured By Design windows and doors and external solar-powered lights. Burglary victims in the control area receive a similar visit and assessment from the crime prevention team, but then receive only advice. In order to maintain the integrity of the design there was no media coverage of the pilot. The pilot was launched September 2014 and is due to be evaluated 12 months following the end of the intervention which lasted roughly five months. The duration was determined by the available NCDP budget allocated for covering the cost of the security upgrades offered in the two trial areas of the city. Therefore the Nottingham target hardening pilot project at the time of writing this cannot be evaluated and the practical and financial impact from burglary reduction of the WIDE security combination implemented has yet to be tested. It has already had however the following positive outcomes: 

? Provided robust and tested physical security to past areas of repeat burglary; 
? Replaced poor windows and doors to homes that either had been targeted or were a potential one; 
? Replaced poor windows for home owners who couldn't afford to replace windows that could not lock or close properly; and
? Reduced the fear of crime and enhanced public reassurance.

As a result of the Nottingham target hardening pilot planning discussions during the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership Board meetings (summer 2013 to spring 2014) the following societal and (considering savings from crime reduction) economic impacts were generated: 

? The University of Nottingham now requires the privately rented student accommodation to be WIDE secured;
? The Nottinghamshire Police Force and the Nottingham City Council launched a burglary target hardening campaign, via the Nottingham City Transport Bus Advertising (on certain routes) the project's finding that door and window locks, external and internal lights offer the most efficient protection against burglars. Neighbouring cities, for example Leicester, have undertaken the same initiative; and
? The Nottingham City Council established minimum security standards requirements for rented property across the city.

The Neighbourhood and Home Watch Network (NHWN) adopted the project's main findings in an infographic. This was designed by the NHWN team and presented to the Home Office and the Minister of Crime Prevention, L. Featherstone, who showed great interest and required further discussions. The infographic also included overleaf the Tseloni et al. (2014) academic journal article's executive summary and URL (http://www.palgrave-journals.com/sj/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/sj201430a.html). The research results have been used at regional and national NHWN associates meetings and they are incorporated in the NHWN business plan.

The project's methodology was:

? Used for testing newsagents' security against shoplifting and the project's findings were discussed in a Policy Exchange Report (http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/taking-its-toll-the-regressive-impact-of-property-crime-in-britain);
? Included in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership on shop theft between Nottingham Trent University and the NCDP and the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner (KTP009423); and
? Disseminated at the National socio-legal training day: Sources and Methods in Criminology and Criminal Justice. Institute of Advanced Legal Studies.

Finally the end of project conference (21.1.2015), including the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Paddy Tipping, and Chief Supt Alex Murray, West Midlands Police and Founder and Chair of the Society of Evidence-Based Policing as speakers, focussed on how to both communicate findings to the public and take them forward to influence security awareness and improvements amongst various stakeholders including:

? security/insurance/building sector organisations;
? DIY chains, Lock and Window industry reps and security testing organisations;
? National Landlords Association, Residents Associations, and student unions with regards to student accommodation;
? Core City Chief Executives and their community safety partnerships;
? Association of Police and Crime Commissioners;
? Local authorities. 

Delegates included the Advisory Committee members (please see earlier discussion), representatives of the Police Foundation, Police Forces around the country, local councils and others.

Prior to this project security devices were grouped together or analysis was conducted simply on the basis of presence or absence of, say, a burglar alarm with little or no regard for whether other devices were in place and, if so, exactly which ones. An extensive list of devices was examined here: Burglar alarm; CCTV; Door double locks or deadlocks; Dummy alarm box; External lights on a timer or sensor; Indoor lights on a timer or sensor; Security chains; Window bars or Grilles; and Windows locks. 

This study found that the above devices, if available individually, confer up to three times greater protection against burglary-with-entry than no security. Burglar alarms and dummy alarms however are a noteworthy exception: They confer less protection against burglary than no security. 

Multiple security devices afford up to roughly 50 times more protection than no security. The burglary protection conferred, however, does not consistently increase with the number of devices that make up the configurations. 
Fitting external lights on a sensor seems to provide greatest protection against any burglary if only one devise can be afforded. Door locks and external lights or window and door locks are effective pairs. Locks together with external lights or security chains protect more than most combinations of four or more devices. Two quadruplets: CCTV, window and door locks and security chains; or lights and locks confer the highest total protection consistently over time. 

From a policy perspective the combination of external and internal lights and window and door locks (WIDE) is the cheapest and safer target hardening option against burglary given the high cost of CCTV and potential fire hazard posed by security chains. 

The findings opened up new research questions: Do alarms diminish the overall burglary protection conferred by security configurations which include them? What are the mechanisms that make alarms counter-productive in burglary prevention? Under what conditions can they be fit for purpose? 

New research networks were formed with researchers from the Observatoire National de la D&amp;eacute;linquance et des R&amp;eacute;ponses P&amp;eacute;nales who independently identified a counter-productive function of burglar alarms using French crime survey data; experts on Secured By Design from the University of Huddersfield who seek to understand these findings via examining the perspective of burglars; and the Health and Wellbeing Network. 

The effectiveness of the security devices was gauged via the Security Impact Assessment Tool (SIAT), a new methodology developed in an earlier ESRC-funded project. The SIAT was improved in this project via examining a larger number of devices than previously. The work identified that SIAT is inappropriate for over-time comparisons of the effectiveness of security prior to 1998 due to security information changes in the data.

Finally new research skills and capability were developed from training successive Research Staff and the delegates of the National Socio-Legal Training Day.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings can be taken forward via:

The pilot was launched September 2014 and is due to be evaluated 12 months following the end of the intervention which lasted roughly five months.

In addition the University of Nottingham established requirements for the privately rented student accommodation to be WIDE secured immediately after hearing the project's findings during the target hardening pilot planning discussions at the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership Board meetings by the PI. 
The Nottinghamshire Police Force and the Nottingham City Council launched a burglary target hardening campaign, via the Nottingham City Transport Bus Advertising (on certain routes) the project's finding that door and window locks, external and internal lights offer the most efficient protection against burglars. Neighbouring cities, for example Leicester, have undertaken the same initiative. 
The above regulations and publicity would reduce burglaries in Nottingham and Leicester overall and especially against Nottingham's private renters and students.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5559d5ba836d73.56932262</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nottmstudents.com/leave-burglars-in-the-dark-this-winter/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Security Impact Assessment Tool (SIAT) is a new methodology developed by three of the co-applicants in their earlier ESRC-funded project and expanded here for testing marginal security effects. If security does not protect from burglary, then the distribution of security devices, including none, would be the same between burgled households and the general population. The SIAT produces 'Security Protection Factors' (SPF's = the odds ratio of burglary risk within households without security with respect to burglary risk within households with security) which measure the protective effect of security. The absence or presence of security for burglary victims was measured at the time of burglary whereas for others at the time of the interview. As an extension, calculating the effect from the absence of a particular device across different security combinations produces the 'Marginal Security Protection Factor' (MSPF's) for that device. This is a new methodological development testing whether individual devices are important additions to security combinations.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3DFA5B88-B555-412B-B294-453D2784261C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The preventive power of security and policy intervention can be gauged thanks to this methodology.
