The lifetime of power plant components is limited because of limits in their endurance under exposure to high temperatures, high loads, radiation, and the effects of cycling of load and temperature; there are issues related to corrosion that are exacerbated by applied stresses and residual stresses in materials; and the high neutron radiation flux in the core of the reactor generates progressive damage that must be understood if we are to be able to design new materials for future reactor systems with improved lifetimes and efficient use of nuclear fuel. This research programme will underpin the development of the nuclear fission power generation systems of the future.Metallic systems used in nuclear reactors range from pressure vessel steels to fuel cladding tubes to stainless steels used in the heat exchangers. The particular operating conditions for each component are unique and require carefully tailored materials properties. There are significant challenges in enhancing materials performance for operations at higher temperatures for longer lifetimes, and we have to improve our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by which materials degrade and by which damage develops in nuclear reactors and their associated high-temperature plant.We will address fundamental research problems in improving the long-term performance of materials for nuclear plant exposed to service conditions of high temperatures, high neutron radiation fluences and complex load histories. The critical research challenges that arise for materials performance under these conditions are Materials Stability and Degradation and State Monitoring of Materials . We propose to address them through a broad collaborative programme incorporating the leading UK university groups and our wide network of external partners.The research programme is targeted mainly at the theme of Long term materials behaviour , but with a significant contribution in the area of fuel cladding materials . We have integrated work in these two areas because there is significant commonality in the research methodology (experimental and modelling) required for the study of the different metallic systems and because of our experience of the significant benefits that flow from maintaining close relationships with other nuclear research programmes in partner institutions.From our previous track record, we confidently expect a high degree of gearing as the work of the new consortium will complement and bring together our existing individual programmes, funded by industry and the Research Councils. In addition to delivering new research outputs and a cohort of trained researchers, this will place us in a strong position to respond effectively and in a coordinated manner to future funding opportunities from industry, the EU and the wider international nuclear community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will provide significant impact for the nuclear materials research sector, academic and industrial, through: - a coherent programme of research into the performance and reliability of nuclear materials; - the provision of a trained body of new researchers at a time of dramatic growth for the UK nuclear sector; - the strengthening and development of effective collaborations between University and industrial partners, including direct transfer of technical skills; - opportunities for leveraging additional funding for fission research, especially from the EU and other sources external to the UK. The applicant team have exceptionally strong collaborative links, and a proven track record of excellence in nuclear materials. Our proposed programme will create a new UK network that expands on the Materials work package of the original KNOO programme in this area through inclusion of (a) new University groups and (b) explicit working collaborations with a wider range of key industrial partners. The integration of the research within the consortium spans research topics, methods and types of material. The partners will work together collaboratively to bring maximum impact from the expertise and capability that is embedded in the consortium. The programme will also create a platform for hugely expanding our collaboration with international partners - opening up access to facilities not available in the UK and to industrial and academic expertise of significant value for the wider UK community. The impact that will be delivered therefore goes beyond the traditional knowledge generation and publication generation, to an improvement in the profile, capability and capacity of the UK's nuclear materials research effort. Therefore an important contribution to impact for the consortium will be in contributing to the restoration of the international profile of the UK as a research leader in the development of nuclear power technologies and the necessary underpinning science. Only by succeeding in this challenge will we be invited to work in partnership with groups in France, the USA and India where the research infrastructure has been sustained for many decades or where there is new funding for activity in nuclear science and technology. Furthermore, as the new nuclear build programme accelerates, and there is increasing investment in this field in Europe and the UK, it is extremely important that the UK is able to demonstrate a mature research capability so that new-build companies will invest confidently in a UK research base rather than relying on offshore sites for research and skills development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>343628</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Hungary, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for Energy Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration on irradiation effect studies and NDT with The Centre for Energy Research (EKI-KFKI) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Hungary</gtr:description><gtr:id>B8CC5CF4-D181-4E9E-8134-230AD8BFAEC7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b965ef28b965ef3c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences KFKI Energy Research Institute (EKI) has a Material Department. This department is collaborating with the material engineering group, involving on research related to PROMINENT project. The EKI has a research reactor to irradiate the material as well testing facilities. Our collaboration will use their capabilities to irradiated the material produced by the OU. The OU is offered to use the the dry irradiation rig called BAGIRA (Budapest Advanced Gas-cooled Irradiation Rig Assembly) is operational in one of the vertical channels since 1998. It is used to irradiate nuclear reactor vessel and fusion equipment materials in order to study and evaluate irradiation ageing. Recently, the rig was redesigned for in-pile fatigue and creep, the structure was strengthened to perform irradiations up to 600&amp;ordm;C and the OU team can use this instrument to investigate its ODS material. The collaboration includes the expertise exchange and skills exchange between the teams of the two institutions. As part of the collaboration the OU team has been using a magnetic NDT equipment for possible use on evaluation of material degradation and stress analysis belonged to EKI. The contributions are on the form of workload of the researchers involved in it, as well the facilities of EKI/Hungary.
