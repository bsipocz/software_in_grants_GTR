It is therefore an exercise in comparative religion. There are two stages to my account: firstly, a historical description of the inner life in the histories of Christianity and Hinduism accompanied by readings of texts. Secondly I will present an interpretation of these issues that draws on the historical material presented in part 1. Here the project focusses on comparison and the development of a thesis about inwardness or subjectivity in the broader history of religions and philosophy of the human person. \nThe project will study the problem of the place of the human person in the history of religions generally and in the history of Christianity and Hinduism in particular. It critically surveys the work of the Anthropologist Marcel Mauss, who saw a developed understanding of the individual as a product of Europe, and Louis Dumont, who linked the individual in Hinduism with the world renouncer, the holy man or ascetic who has given up social obligation in order to seek a personal salvation or liberation. The project will argue that we can distinguish between individuality and subjectivity or inwardness and that in the premodern period both Christianity and Hinduism developed accounts of inwardness that were cultivated through religious practices (asceticism, prayer, meditation). In these histories inwardness is closely linked to the structure of tradition and the perceived structure of the cosmos; that is, a person makes their life conform to the dictates of tradition and lives as though there were within what the Sociologist Berger called a sacred canopy (i.e. there is a link between subjectivity and cosmology). With the rise of modernity this link is broken, as has been highlighted by others (Charles Taylor, Oliver Davies). \nPart 1 of the project presents a historical survey and offers detailed readings of important texts. We see how inwardness in the history of Christianity is linked in the medieval period with the idea of inner or meditative ascent and contacting God within prayer in mystical theology (for example in the 'Cloud of Unknowing' and in the theologian Bonaventure of whom the project presents a reading). Similarly in the history of Hinduism we see how the idea of inwardness is developed from a very early period in Patanjali's 'Yoga-sutras' (1st cent. BCE) through to the early modern period, particularly the tantric traditions. The project will include the reading of particular texts, notably from the philosopher Abhinavagupta (c. 975-1050 CE) and from the 9th or 10th century 'Netra Tantra'. \nPart II will develop a theoretical and comparative account of inwardness. It describes a first level historical description which is linked to the philological reading of texts. It then develops an interpretation of the historical, textual material presented in part 1. This section develops a comparative study of inwardness in Christianity and Hinduism which will demonstrate that both traditions cultivated a concern with inwardness linked to religious practices and linked to ideas about the nature of the cosmos and the place of transcendence in human life. \nThe broader implications of this research is that religion is a viable category across cultures and that the western development of the category of the individual must be distinguished from the development of the category of subjectivity or inwardness. It is the human person understood in terms of subjectivity that is shared in the histories of these religions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I anticipate that the book will have significant impact on the comparative study of religion firstly as a demonstration of the viability of comparative religion in the contemporary intellectual context and secondly as a contribution to theological understanding of the human person. \nThe work will have an impact upon debates about the place of religion in globalisation and religion in relation to democracy and citizenship. The argument will be that if inwardness is a defining feature of the human person, as I have tried to show, then the cultivation of inwardness is necessary for citizenship and is antithetical to fundamentalism. \n\n1. The idea of comparative religion has come under criticism firstly because it was perceived to be an attempt to demonstrate the superiority of Christianity over other religions and secondly with there has been a scepticism about comparative religion because of the emphasis on area studies and the predominance of the relativist idea that cultures are self-contained units. The book will have impact upon this debate in arguing for the viability of comparison and the importance of comparison that avoids problems of universalism but which also claims that human beings are not completely determined by their cultures.\n\n2. The book will contribute to a theological understanding of the human person in arguing that there are shared processes whereby human beings become aware of themselves in the context of transcendence. That is, the date and readings suggest that religions share an understanding of human beings as part of a larger cosmos and the meaning of their lives is intimately linked to the nature of the universe. The book will therefore have considerable impact on theologians working within their own traditions with broader interests. \n\n3. This work will be of interest to interfaith groups, notably the Tony Blair Faith Foundation (whom I have already been a consultant to about the nature of religion), the World Bank's World Faiths Development Dialogue (WFDD), and the Hindu-Christian Forum (for whom I am a consultant). \n\n4. Students will also benefit from my research. It will also attract research students interested in my project and vision for the subject area.\n\n5. Academic Beneficiaries will be comparative theologians, phenomenologists, and historians of South Asian religions and Christianity.\n\n\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45232</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings of my research have had impact beyond the academic study of religion by influencing the policy and practice of theologians.

This idea of inner truth that is 'collective' can be contrasted with modern ideas of 'individual' inwardness and subjectivity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings can be taken forward through 1) further research into the texts I examine by myself or others; 2) others can refer to this work in developing their own work on concepts of person, cosmology, and salvation in the history of religions; 3) Researchers on secularism and modernity can use the findings as a resource for research on the roots on modern notions of self. 

This project has led to further research into the category of 'life itself' as it appears in the history of religions. This new project that has developed from this one, will result in a book currently under consideration by Harvard University Press.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4F5E51D2-36D8-441E-8EA0-BF0A6A60A115</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5445a53209a8c6.53099794</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD9E6CC1-678B-453D-9E8A-DADD7662B1D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Truth Within: A History of Inwardness in Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/163347508f39b1823bbcc8090df9dcc1"><gtr:id>163347508f39b1823bbcc8090df9dcc1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flood</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199684564</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5435df955c7da0.80164262</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J001422/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B726621-12A9-419F-B798-630155FB0A8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
