Online Trust and Empathy</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M00354X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>What do people choose to share online when they find themselves in difficult and precarious circumstances? What can we learn from this about how trust and empathy are established and maintained in online relationships? And what can all of this tell us about sharing, trust and empathy in the offline world? These questions lie at the heart of this innovative research project looking at the online relationships and behaviour of people affected by natural disasters; life-threatening or terminal disease; organ donation; emotional distress and suicidal thoughts; drug use and addiction. Why are we looking at these particular situations? This is because people in these circumstances are extremely vulnerable, and some of them may be seeking information support or help that could make the difference between life and death. That means it may be necessary to establish trust and empathy very quickly to make that difference. In these extreme contexts, people may end up over-sharing, or equally may be disadvantaged by not sharing enough. At the same time, others online need to know when they are responding to genuine distress. Understanding the way that trust and empathy works in these circumstances may help to transform the way in which resources and aid are distributed, locally and globally, and enhance individual and community resilience. But such changes may have both good and bad consequences, so working through the ethics of all this, at personal, global, institutional and governmental levels, will also be at the core of our project. 
The project brings together researchers from a wide range of backgrounds: sociology, international relations, computer sciences, health informatics, philosophy, media studies and bioethics. By working together we hope to produce new 'transdisciplinary' understandings of the issues of sharing, empathy and trust online - in other words, insights that would not be possible using only a single disciplinary lens. All of this will be challenging, but we have begun to exchange ideas and are confident that we will generate findings and perspectives that are genuinely novel. Several themes clearly cut across our disciplinary boundaries and this has helped us to structure our approach to the individual case studies. Our overall approach has been shaped by the notion of 'Facet Methodology'. This suggests that, like light being refracted differently through the various faces of a gemstone, we can understand more about a social problem by viewing it from a number of different angles and perspectives. 
As part of the research, we will be accessing online data from a wide range of sources and interacting with a variety of organisations, including UK charities, international NGOs and health providers. The charity, The Samaritans, will be directly involved as a project partner. The outputs from the research will not be aimed solely at academic audiences and we will be working hard to make them accessible and valuable to this wider set of stakeholders as well as to the general public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
Beneficiaries of this research will include policy-makers in national and international government and non-government agencies. Within the UK, the governmental beneficiaries include DSTL, the Home Office, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Cabinet Office, and the Environment Agency, the Department of Health and the NHS and NHS Blood and Transplant. Within the public and third sector, the Citizens Advice Bureau, MacMillan Cancer Support and Marie Curie Cancer Care, as well as similar organisations providing support to people in extreme circumstances. The organisation, Samaritans, is a project partner and has a particular interest in the role that trust and empathy play in their email service and in peer communication within social media. At an international level, organisations such as the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the World Health Organisation (WHO), Organwatch, Oxfam and other relevant UN and NGOs agencies to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) will be beneficiaries of the research. Given the popularity of, and interest in, the Web as a means of communication, and social media in particular, the results from the project will be of interest to the wider public, and to specific groups, e.g., people who have experienced extreme and life-threatening situations or conditions. In addition, within the commercial private sector, social media platform providers (such as, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, etc.) and mobile communications providers, e.g., Vodafone, will be interested in how their products/services are used for sharing, within the case study contexts, and more generally. 
How will they benefit from this research? 
The research will develop a better understanding of how people in extreme circumstances can be supported in online environments and the role of trust and empathy in this. This will be of value to government and non-government agencies that provide support to people experiencing natural disasters, drug addiction, life-threatening or terminal conditions and people contemplating suicide. It will enable them to develop and increase the effectiveness of their services and contribute to the nation's health, well-being and enhance quality of life, particularly among these vulnerable groups. In addition, and as part of WP6, a partner-specific output will be delivered to Samaritans; this will help inform the development of their current and future services and interventions online. The project also has the potential to impact on the working practices of a wide range of professionals engaged in the reduction of harm and amelioration of harms, or potential harms suffered by people caught up in variety of dangerous, risky or life-threatening situations. 
During the project life-cycle (short/medium term), we will offer to talk or debate at public events, e.g., the Cafe Scientifique network, the Salon network and, at an international level, through liaison with the British Council. We will approach local public venues to offer a small exhibition. In the medium/long term, the project will offer input into global academic links, e.g., the U21 Global Issues Programme, a multi-disciplinary programme offered by the Universitas 21 network, will offer input into global citizenship and global issues dimension of the school curriculum, e.g., via the Global Learning Programme. The Samaritans organisation has also indicated its willingness, through its access to decision-makers, to support the project in ensuring impact on public policy and other service providers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1005214</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>During 2016, we worked with professional photographer, Anton Want, to develop a photographic exhibition based on the findings from the 'A Shared Space and a Space for Sharing' project. The exhibition comprised 12 (2 portraits per Work Package) A0-sized images, which were portraits of people, which had text superimposed containing messages from the Work Packages. In addition there were A0 posters summarising the project as a whole, and the individual Work Packages. The exhibition was displayed for 2 weeks during the ESRC Festival of Social Science in November 2016 in the Winter Gardens in the centre of Sheffield. The Winter Gardens has a very high footfall, hundreds of people passing through each day. 

The exhibition attracted the attention of the local media, and the Sheffield Star newspaper published a photo of Peter Bath and Anton Want against the backdrop of the exhibition in the Winter Gardens.

As social networks have proliferated, users have started
creating profiles on multiple social networks. In such a
setting, we investigate whether the profiles of a user
on different social networks are redundant expressions
of the same persona, or whether users adapt their
profiles on/to each platform. Using the personal webpages
of 116,998 users on About.me, we identify and
extract 275,430 profile images and 229,365 profile selfdescriptions
on several major social networks including
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. By analyzing
these dataset, first, we establish that different social
networks have different norms, both in terms of
the expected kind of profile images used, as well as in
terms of the language found in self-descriptions in pro-
files. Second, we show that users do indeed try to &amp;quot;fit
in&amp;quot; to individual platforms, and therefore adapt to the
norms of a platform: A random forest classifier trained
on the specific norms of a given social network can robustly
identify a user's profile image (i.e., 0.657-0.829
in AUC) or self-description (i.e., 0.608-0.847 in AUC)
on one platform from other profiles of the user on other
platforms. However, despite this fitting in, the different
profiles of a user appear to still be recognisable as expressions
of the same persona. We demonstrate this by
showing that a random forest classifier can separate a
user's profile on a platform from those of up to k = 10
other users on the same platform (i.e., AUC ? 0.7), by
training on the original user's profiles on other social
networks.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e00eb6b46936.67515760-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborators contributing in this paper by both conducting experiments but also by jointly preparing the manuscript.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have contributed to this collaboration by working on a paper about studying behaviour of online users across different social networks.

In this paper, we are interested in understanding the interrelationships
between mainstream and social media
in forming public opinion during mass crises, specifi-
cally in regards to how events are framed in the mainstream
news and on social networks and to how the
language used in those frames may allow to infer political
slant and partisanship. we study the the dynamics
of lingual choices for event framing and political agenda
setting in mainstream and social media by analyzing a
dataset of more than 40M tweets and more than 4M
news articles from the mass protests in Ukraine during
2013-2014 - known as &amp;quot;Euromaidan&amp;quot; - and the postEuromaidan
conflict between Russian, pro-Russian and
Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. We
focus on the most memorable terms - such as memes,
symbolic labels, and personalities - which shaped the
public discourse during the Ukraine crises and show
that lingual choices in mainstream and social media
can point to partisan behavior. We further exploit the
state-of-the-art natural language Word2Vec representation
to analyze at scale the linguistic markers which
point to a particular political leaning in online media
and show that political slant in news articles and Twitter
posts can be inferred with high accuracy. These
results contribute to the debate on the role of social
media in fostering grassroots frames and partisan discourse
during political crises and helps to uncover the
extent to which the two media spheres - social and
mainstream - compete or cooperate with each other
as parts of a networked system of politicized frames and
partisan language shaping the overall conversation</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>NHS England</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Space for Sharing Advisory Panel Meeting 1</gtr:description><gtr:id>6560B029-2662-4B3B-B2F2-CFD48EFA95E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stakeholder workshop (with Tinder foundation) at the University of Sheffield as part of the Festival of Social Sciences 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c348cd62f761.59742197-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Feedback and input from service users.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing initial findings and innovative research methods with partners.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cardiff University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Space for Sharing Advisory Panel Meeting 2</gtr:description><gtr:id>8746ADD1-9078-440E-8D27-147E5DCA094B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussions with Tinder foundation re: Studentship in the area of Transdiciplinary Research</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c3499138ad31.72273753-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Feedback and suggestions from services user perspective.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing findings and results and highlighting transdiciplinary research</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Goldsmiths, University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Space for Sharing Advisory Panel Meeting 1</gtr:description><gtr:id>22467054-5E8C-4EB5-B3C7-05F68178F5A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stakeholder workshop (with Tinder foundation) at the University of Sheffield as part of the Festival of Social Sciences 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c348cd62f761.59742197-7</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Feedback and input from service users.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing initial findings and innovative research methods with partners.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Warwick</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Philosophy</gtr:department><gtr:description>Social Innovation Group of the Personal Data and Trust Network: Digilatism and Crowd Justice Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:id>EAE7A0A7-64AE-4302-AFF8-C6A3A4E72987</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project is at an early stage with only one workshop held so far.

In this paper, we are interested in understanding the interrelationships
between mainstream and social media
in forming public opinion during mass crises, specifi-
cally in regards to how events are framed in the mainstream
news and on social networks and to how the
language used in those frames may allow to infer political
slant and partisanship. we study the the dynamics
of lingual choices for event framing and political agenda
setting in mainstream and social media by analyzing a
dataset of more than 40M tweets and more than 4M
news articles from the mass protests in Ukraine during
2013-2014 - known as &amp;quot;Euromaidan&amp;quot; - and the postEuromaidan
conflict between Russian, pro-Russian and
Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. We
focus on the most memorable terms - such as memes,
symbolic labels, and personalities - which shaped the
public discourse during the Ukraine crises and show
that lingual choices in mainstream and social media
can point to partisan behavior. We further exploit the
state-of-the-art natural language Word2Vec representation
to analyze at scale the linguistic markers which
point to a particular political leaning in online media
and show that political slant in news articles and Twitter
posts can be inferred with high accuracy. These
results contribute to the debate on the role of social
media in fostering grassroots frames and partisan discourse
during political crises and helps to uncover the
extent to which the two media spheres - social and
mainstream - compete or cooperate with each other
as parts of a networked system of politicized frames and
partisan language shaping the overall conversation</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Breast Cancer Care</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Research collaboration - Breast Cancer Care</gtr:description><gtr:id>F29BCFF1-BA45-4716-8F85-9FBA20187D75</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster / abstract at 17th International Symposium for Health Information Management Research (ISHIMR 2015).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d01a92d3b0e3.12257825-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Breast Cancer Care supported the research by agreeing to our analysing the material posted on their online discussion forum.

Papers at #SMAO15 not only advanced our understandings of contemporary uses of social media use in social movements, but also the many ways in which we can critically reflect on their potential and limitations. Importantly, organizational communication perspectives were central to #SMAO15 and the contributions made give scholars in this interdisciplinary area much to think about. Questions around social media in formal and informal movement organizations were explored from a variety of methodological perspectives, including social network analysis, ethnography, surveys, participant observation and big data analytics. Papers covered regional case studies in Europe, North America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In addition, #SMAO15 brought together practitioners, artists, and scholars. This unique constituency of attendees yielded new perspectives and approaches to studying social media, activism, and organizations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56de2cae01fb98.32828482</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A097A0DF-E3D1-41AA-A6AC-194E55158542</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview for BBC online programme called 'Digital Disruptors' about the privacy implications of an app that shares phone contact information to build up a global phone directory.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df4920802243.31346451</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Balloon debate at Festival of Education Wellington College on 23 June 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C1C34C07-1804-4782-8F90-FA26C3C9AAE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk related to Michael Faraday as part of University in One Day at Festival of Education, Wellington College</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c90f4a8e2aa2.74552276</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://festivalofeducation.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog:  2014 Balkan Floods &amp; Tvitomanija - One Year On</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E3B4B9E5-E52D-4215-A169-F8A0BAE6B3EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog on the coordination using social media following the 2014 Balkan Floods</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c70f8116ea56.95524197</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.space4sharingstudy.org/?p=891</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on documentary analysis, Social Science Summer School, Edinburgh University</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>20A007C5-B662-4B90-A178-7012810A06B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop focused on documentary analysis which was attended by postgraduate students from across Scotland.

The aim of the workshop was for the stakeholders to develop an understanding of social science research, to discuss the 'A Shared Space and A Space for Sharing' project, to discuss some of the barriers to people using online spaces for sharing information, experiences and emotions and to explore ways of overcoming challenges to people using online resources. The workshop also sparked discussion for future research ideas and proposals. Following the workshop, the research team (Peter Bath, Melanie Lovatt and Julie Ellis) worked with Tinder Foundation (James Richardson) to write a blog about the workshop (http://www.tinderfoundation.org/our-thinking/blog/shared-space-and-space-sharing-online-health-forums-digital-exclusion) - this was published on the Tinder Foundation web-site.

Via the feedback forms, attendees reported many positive effects from the workshop. These included comments that the workshop had generated new knowledge and ideas for improvements - for instance about barriers to engaging with forums - for them to take back to their workplaces, which would ultimately benefit their service users / members. Other comments included the benefits of sharing knowledge with other stakeholders and learning more about online health forums.


Feedback from workshop participants include: 

Broadened knowledge and understanding slightly, will research more as a result.
Extended current knowledge held. Reinforced effectiveness of strategies deployed by organisation. Provided a wider perspective on the issue discussed.
Lots of new ideas.
I think forums have a place in social prescribing to assist people.
I now understand the benefits of online health problems but also their issues.

13.00-14.00: Roundtable: New drugs and the 'bigger picture' (Chaired by Dr. Kate O'Brien)

A collection of eminent drug researchers consider the impact that new drugs have had on the work that they do, for example in reconstituting the way that we think about legislating for the control of drugs, designing interventions to help people who use drugs, and understanding the way that drugs are bought and sold.

I spoke on a panel including the following: Professor Susanne McGregor (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine), Professor Dave Boothroyd (University of Lincoln), Professor Shane Blackman (Canterbury Christchurch University), Dr. Axel Klein (Global Drug Policy Observatory, Swansea University), and Professor Alex Stevens (University of Kent).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c82d93ee8722.18902626</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://newdrugseminars.wordpress.com/seminars/final-event/tuesday-6th-september-new-drugs-mini-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster presented at 26th International Symposium on ALS/MND</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DECD01FB-3851-490B-9293-5C601ACB43CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presented at the 26th International Symposium on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Motor Neurone Disease 2015.
