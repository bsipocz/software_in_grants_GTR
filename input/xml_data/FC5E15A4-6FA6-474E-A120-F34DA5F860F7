At the same time we subject it to various pressures by discharging sewage treatment plants into rivers and lakes, over-extraction that leaves too little water in them, and polluting them via many sources both accidental and deliberate. Rural sources of pollution are relatively well understood and significant advances have been made in tackling surface water pollution from agricultural pesticides and agricultural runoff. Urban pollution offers a more complex problem where the relative importance of different sources of pollution, and the severity of the effects, is less clear. Meanwhile, there are many pieces of legislation that affect water users directly and indirectly, and policymakers need to be able to know that there is sound science behind their policies.

This study has a goal of promoting new research that will answer key policy questions. To do this, the study will investigate the broad range of research currently being performed on pollution in the urban water environment. It aims to pinpoint areas of research still needed, focusing on both the most immediately useful and the most far-reaching areas, while recognising the social and economic aspects that are intrinsically linked to them. At the same time, the intention is to highlight work already performed whose full usefulness has not necessarily been recognised. By viewing it in a wider context, it is hoped to make links and associations that will enable the research to be reused and increase its usefulness.

To establish the relevant research already available, the range of NERC-funded research will first be investigated, in cooperation with Defra, the Environment Agency, the Forestry Commission and Natural England, all bodies who are closely involved. Next, identifying the various groups who have a stake in water in the urban environment and establishing their viewpoints will help establish what are their priorities and the most pressing concerns. At the same time, we hope to make use of their skills and areas of knowledge, and simultaneously make them aware of the data, skills and facilities that may be available to them. 

There should be two main outcomes from the study. The first is the development of a series of questions that need to be answered in order to manage urban pollution for the benefit of those concerned, including the public. These questions will be designed so that further NERC-funded research will be able to provide the answers, and these answers should be able to contribute sound evidence to inform environmental policymaking. The second outcome should be increased awareness and cooperation between the various partners and stakeholders. These developing partnerships will give a wider perspective and increase the breadth of input to the research process, while offering benefits in increased understanding across a wide range of groups that will lead to improved support for environmental improvements from both the public and business.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24165</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department For Environment, Food And Rural Affairs (DEFRA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Joint Water Evidence Group (JWEG)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Defra-Imperial College UDWP collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>9E51F7C3-6D21-44E4-9D18-DF29E938056C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Urban Diffuse Pollution Workshop, Birmingham, 2nd March 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e1ab2cc40896.70047968-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provision of background information, access to data, contacts and previous internal and restricted publications.
