According to this view, frictions limit arbitrageurs' ability to exploit price discrepancies, driving asset prices away from fundamentals. A relevant role in this respect is played by liquidity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The liquidity of an asset captures the ease with which the asset can be traded. Several factors, such as transactions costs, asymmetric information or search costs, impinge on liquidity. Recent contributions point to the fact that the liquidities of different assets display comovements and vary across time. As a consequence liquidity risk (the risk that liquidity worsens when investors need to trade) affects asset prices. In view of the events related to the subprime crisis, extreme manifestations of the impact of liquidity risk abound. On May 6, 2010 several US-based equities and equity products experienced a sharp price and liquidity decline followed by a rapid recovery, giving raise to the so-called ?Flash Crash.? Similarly, at the peak of the subprime crisis the markets for several, traditionally liquid, securities disappeared. In this project the PI investigates liquidity comovement across markets and over time, stressing the role of prices as conveyors of information for market participants.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65595</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Signal failure : why illiquidity in one asset can spread quickly to others</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F0BDE405-62CF-48D2-8A7D-0182ABF7A311</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article in The Economist

In the paper, we start from the consideration that liquidity fluctuates over time and those fluctuations are correlated across assets. This 'co-movement' is a source of non-diversifiable risk. Few theories have been successful at explaining liquidity co-movements and thus why investors demand a discount to hold illiquid securities. With the help of the ESRC grant entitled, 'Liquidity spillovers, asset pricing and information acquisition in financial markets,&amp;quot; held from 30/9/2011 to 31/12/2012), together with Thierry Foucault (Professor of Finance at HEC, Paris) we developed one such theory. In detail, in the paper, we formalise the interconnection between the information embedded in asset prices, and how liquidity suppliers respond to this information. We show that such liquidity-price informativeness interconnection generates liquidity spillovers across prices, and can lead to liquidity crashes with subsequent huge price drops, in the absence of any major economic event.
Our theory has influenced the policy debate on the safeguards to prevent liquidity crisis. 
1. Our central prediction fits the narrative of recent market disruptions, such as the &amp;quot;Flash Crash&amp;quot; of May 6, 2010. On that day, a sudden price collapse affected a host of securities in the US, causing the largest intraday plunge (and recovery) in the history of the Dow Jones, and wiping nearly a trillion dollars from the market. All of this in the space of thirty-six minutes. This episode raised policy makers' attention over its causes, spurring the discussion around potential remedies. In this respect, our paper was cited in a testimony in front of the US Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on the 'Flash Crash' (See Computerized Trading: What should the rule of the road be?). The liquidity evaporation mechanism that we describe in the paper was deemed consistent with a narrative of the Flash Crash where &amp;quot;High Frequency Traders&amp;quot; (HFT), acting as liquidity providers who use prices to make payoff inference, entered in a self-reinforcing trading loop, causing the market rout. That discussion, in turn, led to a policy proposal to the US SEC by the Consumer Federation of America (Comments on Concept Release on Equity Market Structure) to introduce explicit liquidity provision obligations for HFT, which used our theory as a prong. Indeed, over the past 10 years, stock exchanges around the world have moved from a model where liquidity provision relied on the presence of special intermediaries with well-defined obligations (&amp;quot;designated&amp;quot; market makers), to one in which HFT act in such a capacity, on a voluntary basis. As argued by policy makers in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin an implication of our theory, is that this new model is prone to sudden liquidity dry-ups, which the reintroduction of designated market makers, could possibly ameliorate.
2. Our theory has also contributed to the debate on the risks of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), an asset class whose market share has dramatically increased in recent years. ETFs are portfolios of securities that, similarly to traditional mutual funds, replicate an index but, differently from them, can be continuously traded, like stocks. While ETFs are generally seen as an equity-like liquid investment, in times of stress their liquidity tends to quickly evaporate, leading to large price drops and exposing investors to huge losses. Indeed, due to their nature of negotiable portfolios of securities, arbitrageurs keep ETFs' prices in line with those of the securities on which they load. However, as the prices of ETFs and those of their underlying securities contain information, arbitrageurs can also transmit liquidity shocks from former to the latter (and vice-versa), in much the same way as we describe in our theory. By proving the existence of these liquidity spillovers to and from ETFs, our theory contributed to the policy debate in the Bank of Canada's Financial System Review (December 2014), on the risks to which ETF investors are exposed. 
3. Finally, our theory also had a bearing on the ECB &amp;quot;Quantitative Easing&amp;quot; policy discussion and implementation. In March 2015, the European Central Bank initiated the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP, ECB's Quantitative Easing). A fundamental underlying principle of the PSPP has been to minimize the &amp;quot;unintended consequences&amp;quot; of such a non-standard monetary policy measure. This implied avoiding the purchase of securities displaying significant liquidity shortages, to minimize the risks of liquidity spillovers highlighted by our theory (see the speech by Beno&amp;icirc;t C?ur&amp;eacute;'s --- member of the ECB executive committee --- &amp;quot;Embarking on public sector asset purchases&amp;quot;). 
 
Our research also received wide coverage in the financial press and the finance blogosphere, in relation to financial market disruptions: 
1. Related to the flash crash: The Economist covered our research in a Buttonwood piece (&amp;quot;Signal Failure,&amp;quot; Buttonwood, October 27, 2012). Our research was also covered by the Blogs &amp;quot;Themistrading&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Contagion, Correlation, Fragility, Feedback Loops, Liquidity Crashes&amp;quot;), and &amp;quot;The Trade&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Caught Cold?&amp;quot;). 
2. Related to the Knight Capital incident, our research was covered by the financial news website &amp;quot;The Street&amp;quot; (The Lessons of Knight Capital, August 16, 2012).
Knight Capital was a US financial services firm that up to 2012 held the largest market share in HFT activity. On August 1, 2012, while testing one of its trading algorithms, the company incidentally sent actual trading orders to the market, causing a major disruption in the prices of many stocks. This caused a collapse in Knight's stock price, and the subsequent acquisition of the company by Getco LLC, a US algorithmic trading company.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CE123C36-ADE7-4593-B569-7A17AF3044E4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c2014cf393c5.93611911</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. In the paper &amp;quot;Dynamic trading and asset prices: Keynes vs. Hayek,&amp;quot; (with X. Vives, Review of Economic Studies, 2012), we relate the fact that asset prices can score worse or better than the market consensus opinion in predicting the fundamentals to the impact of short-term speculation. Our analysis also explains momentum and reversal in stock returns and how accommodation and trend-chasing strategies differ from these phenomena.
2. In the paper &amp;quot;Sale of price information by exchanges: Does it promote price discovery?&amp;quot; (with T. Foucault, Management Science, 2014), we analyse the role of Exchanges as providers of trading services and price information. We study how the joint pricing of these products affects price discovery and the distribution of gains from trade in the market. A wider dissemination of price information reduces pricing errors and the losses of liquidity traders. This effect reduces the fee that speculators are willing to pay for trading. To raise its revenue from trading, a for-profit exchange optimally charges a high fee for price information and only a fraction of speculators buy this information. Hence, price discovery is not as efficient as it would be with &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; prices. This problem is less severe if the exchange compensates liquidity traders for a fraction of their losses.
3. In the paper Illiquidity contagion and liquidity crashes (with T. Foucault; Review of Financial Studies, 2015), we argue that liquidity providers in a security often learn information from the prices of other securities. We show that cross-asset learning generates a self-reinforcing relationship between price informativeness and liquidity, which yields contagion and fragility. A drop in the liquidity of one security can, through a feedback loop, result in a larger drop in market liquidity and price informativeness. It also generates multiple equilibria characterized either by high illiquidity and low price informativess or low illiquidity and high price informativeness. A switch from the latter to the former type of equilibrium generates a liquidity crash. 
4. In the paper &amp;quot;The Beauty Contest and short term trading,&amp;quot; (with X. Vives, Journal of Finance, 2016), we show that short-termism need not breed informational price inefficiency even when generating beauty contests. We demonstrate this claim in a two-period market where liquidity trading is predictable and short-term investors speculate on private information, making prices reflect average expectations about fundamentals and liquidity trading. Informed investors engage in &amp;quot;retrospective&amp;quot; learning to reassess inferences (about fundamentals) made during the trading game's early stages. This behavior introduces strategic complementarities in the use of information and can yield two stable equilibria that can be ranked in terms of liquidity, volatility, and informational efficiency. We derive implications that explain market anomalies as well as empirical regularities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The result obtained in the papers published with the help of the grant have received wide attention both in the financial press and in among regulators:

One of the four witnesses was David Lauer, who is a Market Structure and High Frequency Trading consultant to Better Markets. Better Markets is a nonprofit, nonpartisan U.S. organisation that promotes the public interest in the domestic and global capital and commodity markets. It advocates for transparency, oversight and accountability with the goal of a stronger, safer financial system that is less prone to crisis and failure, thereby, eliminating or minimising the need for more taxpayer funded bailouts. Better Markets has filed almost 100 comment letters in the U.S. rule making process related to implementing the financial reform law and has had dozens of meetings with regulators. See their website, http://www.bettermarkets.com, for more information on these and the other activities they promote.



Mr Lauer has significant experience in high frequency trading (HFT) research, trading and technology (use and development). He has submitted a lengthy written testimony explaining his opinion on the state of the markets today, and how they got to that state. 



In his testimony, he cites my paper (co-authored with Thierry Foucault), saying that the &amp;quot;illiquidity contagion&amp;quot; concept I develop there provides a consistent description of the mechanism behind the May 6, 2010 &amp;quot;Flash-Crash&amp;quot; in the US securities market, which is in line with his view as a practitioner that was in the market on the day of the crash (see p. 8 of the testimony that can be downloaded at either of the following addresses:
