John Bale, Running Cultures, Routledge, 2004, p1\n\nFor 12 years my practice, located in the field of contemporary performance, has focused on ideas of travel, journey and context, often operating across extended timeframes; elements of duration and physical 'endurance' have been central to my work. My other areas of enquiry include performance for public space, the social impact of context-specific performance, and performance and narrative. My practice can be framed as a body-cultural enquiry: the deployment of the human body (often the performer's own) as a catalyst for - and site of - cultural phenomena. Performance art, live art, and specific parts of theatrical, visual and textual practice - contexts my work operates across - can be framed as body-cultural enquiries. \n\nThrough critical examination of my own practice and substantial exposure to the broader field, I have identified a key problematic that has been widely overlooked, perhaps due its apparent utilitarian yet complex nature. As a mode of practical enquiry that deploys the human body as its central site of investigation, the field is yet to undertake serious investigation into an activity that - many argue - defines both the cultural history and the present physical form of the human body: running, more specifically endurance running. The relevance of this problematic is thrown into sharp relief by the neighbouring fields of contemporary biology and anthropology, which for two decades have engaged in research on endurance running, resulting in a near complete rewriting of the socio-cultural place of running and the history of the human body; an event to which body-cultural enquiries in the arts are yet to seriously respond. \n\n'Endurance Running Hypothesis', as proposed by Bramble and Lieberman (University of Utah and Harvard University respectively), frames human survival and the evolution of the human body as products of our ability to run considerable distances, typically between twenty and three hundred miles. The hypothesis is linked to persistence hunting, in which prey is exhausted by being outrun. This is how the light Homo sapiens survived when the heavier Neanderthals did not. We are human, the hypothesis implies, because we ran, and we continue to inhabit the bodies of endurance runners.\n\nA critical question for contemporary performance practice emerges from this hypothesis: how does a body-based field of cultural enquiry, especially one such as mine that specifically approaches ideas of endurance and travel, respond to this framing of the human body as an endurance running body? The question is not whether endurance running can be discussed in terms of being 'art', rather what knowledge can be gained by using endurance running as a mode and site of performance-based research. \n\nThe programme takes my practical investigations as a model and operates across the schools of Arts and Humanities, Biomedical and Health Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering at King's College London. Mentored by Professor of Theatre Alan Read the fellowship will establish creative dialogue between the specialisms of performance studies, literature, biology, biomechanical engineering and anatomical studies. Practical exploration will produce three professional performance outcomes. Discursive and analytical enquiries will inform and review the research through two papers and a seminar series located at the Anatomy Theatre &amp;amp; Museum - a live and 'digital' space for interdisciplinary performance research at King's. The programme's objective is to create a body of practical research on endurance running as a mode and site of performance enquiry that not only contributes to contemporary performance practice's study of endurance, but impacts across the public realm and related acad</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will be beneficial to the following 4 key contexts:\n\n1.National and international artists, professionals, professional bodies and academics in the field of contemporary performance practice/research (including performance art, live art and specific parts of theatrical, textual and visual arts practice). These include, but are not limited to:\n\nProfessionals and professional bodies:\nThe Live Art Development Agency, UK \nFADO - Performance Art Centre, CA\nLouise Jefferies, The Barbican, UK \nNew Work Network, UK\nKristy Edmonds, Park Avenue Armory, US\nSven &amp;Aring;ge Birkeland, BIT Teatergarasjen, NO \nChuck Helm, The Wexner Centre for the Arts, US\n\nArtists: \nEssi Kausalainen, FI \nIvana Muller, HR \nBak Truppen, NO \nAdele Prince, UK \nMartin O'Brien, UK\nAnti Laitinen, FI\nStephine Nadeau, US\nGwendoline Robin, BE\nAugusto Corrieri, IT/UK \nSearch Party, UK\nMartin Creed, UK\nFranko B, UK \nPanther, AU \nRegin Igloria, US \n\n2.Academics involved in research on Endurance Running Hypothesis, biomechanical engineering and anatomical studies\n3.Academics involved in literary/cultural study\n4.The general public \n\nArtists, academics, professionals and professional bodies in the field of contemporary performance practice will benefit from research on the body's relationship to 'endurance'. Although endurance - and duration - are both central areas in much body-based practice/research very little emphasis has been placed on our physical relationship to such activities, and no work, to date, has taken place on Endurance Running Hypothesis's reframing of the human body as a running body. Academics in the field of literary/cultural practice and those in biomechanical and anatomical research will benefit from a unique dialogue with a practising artist - creating a valuable investigation into the cultural agency of endurance running. \n\nAll beneficiaries, including the general public, will encounter the research through attending - or by accessing documentatin of - three performance outcomes and by attending - or by accessing online - a series of four seminars. The performance works will take place in public space, engendering public discussion on endurance, journey and travel, health and fitness and the socio-cultural place of endurance running. A seminar and performance event will take place during London's hosting of the Olympic marathon, capitalising on interest in endurance running and ideas of running as public urban spectacle. \n\nThe fellowship will be launched at an evening seminar in King's Anatomy &amp;amp; Theatre Museum. All outcome events - the seminar series and performance works - will be open to academics, related professionals and the general public. Outcomes will be widely publicised; print and e-flyers will be circulated; national media (including specialist running publications and websites) will be notified as will all related e-lists and discussion groups; all national and international beneficiaries listed here will be notified and invited. \n\nThe academic community and the general public will be further engaged through the publication of two research papers; extracts from these are expected to appear in popular running magazines, widening public awareness of the programme. The programme's website will be extensively networked across all relevant academic, performance-based and public/running contexts. The site will carry live broadcast and recorded documentation of both the research processes and its outcomes. \n\nI have a proven track record of delivering performance outcomes and related activities to a wide national and international audience. Past performances works, similar in size and scope to those proposed here, have received live audiences of over 10,000 people per project and have been widely covered by national and international media alongside academic publications/journals and conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98599</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>2015 ANTI Contemporary Art Festival, Kuopio, Finland, founded in 2002, is one of the world's leading presenters of contemporary performance and live art. The 2015 edition of the festival (01/09/15 -06/09/15) was created in partnership with the fellowship award and was itself produced in collaboration with Kuopio Marathon - this was my initiative and grew from research conducted through the course of the fellowship. The festival's programme responded to the themes and environment of the marathon (the two events occurred at the same time, across the same city). In a programme of 11 international works and new commissions, all responding to ideas of social participation and physical endurance 4 of those were running specific, and it's those 4, as part of the broader festival that are presented here as a set of curatorial outcomes: All The Queen's Men, Fun Run, Vicki Weitz, Running Beyond Language, Sandra Hall, Coming Back and Kai Syng Tan and Alan Latham ANTI-ADULT RUN! RUN! RUN! MASTERCLASS. We are currently editing video material of those works, for dissemination across various networks, an initial, rough-cut, can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbnjqQeptaM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be

A broad public audience of 10,000 encountered the projects in public space, with each project taking place in everyday city environments. Three of the projects were presented across considerable time periods. Vicki Weitz's Fun Run comprised a 24-hour durational run, Sandra Hall's video work Coming Back played on loop throughout the festival in public space and All The Queen's Men Fun Run occupied the city's market square for some five hours. These durational works created manifold opportunities for audiences to engage with their presence and proposition. All of the works had a participatory element: Kai Syng Tan and Alan Latham worked with a group of local children to deliver their work, Vicki Weitz invited Kuopio residents to run with her across the 24 hours, Sandra Hall worked with local runners to realise her video work and Fun Run engaged numerous local groups and clubs, folding them into the fabric of their arresting live work. In all these projects, focused on running were built around participatory and socially-impactful strategies and ambitions, offering a considerable public audience the opportunity to rethink the cultural, and social value, and agency, of running. A remote audience of many thousands followed the projects online (Running Beyond Language was streamed live for the full 24 hours) and across social media. Further audiences, including performance academics, performance markers and researchers from human and cultural geography, are encountering the work via dissemination of festival documentation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e01c80ed9456.49453815</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>2015 ANTI Contemporary Art Festival (running programme)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.antifestival.com/2015/eng/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ANTI Contemporary Arts Festival 2015</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Finland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>ANTI Contemporary Art Festival Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>D6FDAF7F-A091-4C7E-905F-A5D75886739E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcome of this partnership realised the main programme to the 2015 ANTI Contemporary Arts Festival, which itself was programmed in collaboration with Kuopio Marathon. The various international projects presented at the festival were themselves inherently interdisciplinary, they included participatory/community arts practices, performance work, dance, video and text work - all with a focus on endurance running. The broader festival programme reflected these themes but those works not necessarily focused on running-related matters. And so it is these four projects, along with a conference, that can more specifically be termed outcomes (in a curatorial sense):

As an annual cultural event (with a 2015 global budget of 150,000 Euro) it provided my research with a substantial and broad specialist and public audience - one which would have been extremely difficult to achieve by solo effort. Various PR support etc. was provided by the festival alongside all production duties. The 2015 festival, itself a collaboration with a large-scale participatory sports event, constitutes a unique contribution to discourse around the meeting and potential common ground for arts and sport, where - in this instance - one adds cultural and economic value to the other.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The 2015 edition of ANTI Contemporary Art Festival, Kuopio, Finland, was programmed and produced in collaboration with Kuopio Marathon (the marathon was not in formal partnership with my research, instead the festival and myself - as a single unit - collaborated with the marathon, under the banner of ANTI Contemporary Art festival). I initiated the relationship with Kuopio Marathon and ANTI Festival's focus on running - we commissioned and presented 3 international running-based performance works and 1 international running-based video work, alongside producing an international conference titled 'The Art of Endurance'. The festival had a boarder programme which I also directed (and have done for pervious editions of the festival) however it's the running-specific works that were produced through this partnership; the focus on endurance running was unique to this 2015 edition of the festival, as was the formal partnership between the festival and my fellowship, with the idea growing from my research conducted across the last 4 years. Against &amp;pound;1500 deployed from my fellowship budget the festival team and myself raised a further 20,00 Euro to commission and fund 4 substantial endurance running-based public art projects. As an internationally significant arts festival this constitutes considerable exposure and impact for the research.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Panel presentation with Penny Andrews, artist and Para Athlete at Dangerous Currents: Risk and Regulation at the Interface of Medicine &amp; the Arts, the Association for Medical Humanties 2015 Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A493421B-7D1F-461B-9C7A-20BE03A6F82A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation with artist and Para Athlete (T36 100m) on contemporary, popular, narratives of running and their problematic relationship to ideas of the 'natural born runner'.

An article was duly produced, by myself, and was published in the March 2017 edition of the magazine. Further to the impact made by its inclusion in the magazine, the best-selling UK running publication, Murphy's initial interest in the research is a welcome sign of its impact and visibility, and the resulting conversation around creative uses of running with the magazine is an indication of the potential public value of such work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca84ac7c9f14.99555493</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.runnersworld.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Marathon Expo Presentation (Finland)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC86346B-A45D-4980-874B-383AB000A97C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A conversation/presentation with UK artist and Para Athlete Penny Andrews at Kuopio Marathon Expo 2015.

With a festival audience of over 10,000 the programme had considerable national and international reach and impact, in terms of audiences encountering the work and participating with it; each project had a participatory element, and via its dissemination through online documentation and live streaming. The programme was discussed widely across Finnish broadcast and print media. The programme was curated in collaboration with Kuopio Marathon, the two events ran concurrently, and thus members of the running community also encountered the projects and participated with them, creating a context of dual cultural and sports participation. The impact of the programme, shown across the ANTI Festival week (01/09/15 - 06/09/15) was on a broad public audience apprehending the agency, presence and potentials of running when framed in social and cultural terms and deployed as a creative act. 

'Stage Flight', an article on artists who use running in their work, appears in the March 2017 edition of Runners World Magazine. The article profiles 5 UK and international artists, working in a range of media and forms. The content and focus of the article is relatively unusual for the context, which is primarily focused on pragmatic exercise and nutrition instruction/advice and human-interest narratives. Runners World is the leading UK running publication, with a combined digital and print circulation of 80,000 (monthly) and an average of 4,730,514 page views per 6 months (data as collected in 2013). The publication context provides substantial reach and potential public awareness and impact for the research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0C849630-2659-42B7-AF4C-DBD8A29C3184</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e0987f3177f5.31051666</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Please see the Key Findings section for the award AH/H033386/1.
