provides a unique and valuable opportunity for a team of social scientists from the University of York and three important employers from the York labour market (City of York Council, Joseph Rowntree Foundation/Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust and York St John University) to collaborate on an applied research project, using mixed-methods research to underpin a knowledge exchange.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research project and knowledge exchange will focus on one specific geographical labour market, York. However the challenges currently being faced by these three employers are not York specific. The knowledge exchange will centre on the design and analysis of a structured quantitative poverty survey and a follow-up qualitative survey of employees from the project partners? workforce, as well as an economic analysis of the recent Living Wage implementation at each of the three partner organisations. The applied research project will allow a knowledge exchange between the research team and the project partners on the likely effectiveness of current measures being employed to reduce in-work poverty within their organisations. In addition, via the active engagement with the applied research project the project partners will be part of a collaborative discussion centred on sharing and developing effective and sustainable approaches to in-work poverty.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit
Identifying effective and sustainable pathways out of in-work poverty holds significant benefit for workers, their families, employers and the state. Those directly benefitting from this project will be workers at City of York Council (CYC), Joseph Rowntree Foundation/Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust (JRF/JRHT) and York St John University (YSJU) and in particular those employees with wage rates between the national Living Wage rate and the JRF's Minimum Income Standard (MIS) rate for single persons and 'two earner couple with two children'.

Also directly benefiting from this project are the project partner employers CYC, JRF/JRHT and YSJU as there will be a direct benefit to the employers in terms of improving knowledge on how to best direct policies to reduce in-work poverty and it will also directly support CYC, JRF/JRHT and YSJU in their own organisation's adoption of an effective and sustainably embedded Living Wage policy.

Locally within the York labour market there will be benefit through shared best practice to both employers and their workforces on policies to reduce in-work poverty. Regionally the same point will also hold and in particular there will be value to other regional local authorities (e.g. Newcastle and Sheffield and who like York have run 'Fairness' commissions) who also currently addressing the serious challenge of how to make the Living Wage commitment sustainable.
 
Nationally beneficiaries will include; Employer groups including the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Federation of Small Businesses and Business in the Community, Universities Human Resources (UHR), University and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), and the GuildHE; Trade unions including the Trade Unions Congress (TUC) and UNISON; Central government departments including HM Treasury, Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS), Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and also the Low Pay Commission (LPC); Poverty and Living Wage campaign/ research groups including Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), the Resolution Foundation, Work Foundation, the Living Wage Foundation, Citizens UK, Trust for London, Zacchaeus Trust and Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG))

How will they benefit
The project will have demonstrable impact through being; instrumental in directly affecting the development of employer based policy and best practice in relation to 'in-work poverty' within each of the project partner organisations, and also specifically on the sustainable embedding of the Living Wage policy; conceptual as the applied research project will make a contribution to the deeper understanding of policy issues relating to in-work poverty and the adoption of voluntary wage floors. Indeed the research project will extend or reframe the debate centred on the Living Wage, to become broader, encompassing additional in-work poverty measures that employer could engage with; and capacity building through the collaboration and knowledge exchange between the research team and the project partners, allowing a two-way exchange of knowledge and experience between the researchers and employers as practitioners. 

In terms of the timeline of the beneficial impact there will be immediate impact during the 12-month project due to the continuous engagement with the project partners. At the end of the project period there will be a public/invited workshop which will present the research findings and share best practice from the research team and project partners with an audience of interested groups. To achieve longer-term impact the findings will be disseminated through policy-related and academic engagements, academic publication, and by the research team encouraging and supporting the project partners in their own dissemination within relevant international, national and local professional networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90083</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The ESRC knowledge exchange (KE) project has centred on the design and analysis of a structured quantitative poverty survey, and follow-up qualitative survey. The knowledge exchange has provided information on employer actions that might be engaged with as part of an 'anti-poverty strategy' that includes, but is not limited to the adoption of the voluntary 'Living Wage' policy. 

Initial impact of our KE project has been focused within our three project partner organisations and how they have responded to our findings and suggestions for considering additional 'pathways' out of low-pay. The key findings of the research project have been shared through external engagement and collaboration with the project partners on an ongoing basis throughout, and after the project period. 

Illustrative examples of the embedding and/or further thinking at the three projects partners, either instigated or informed by our KE project includes: all three partners reviewing and/or considering further how the 'employee benefit schemes' operate at their organisations (composition, communication/access and staff confidence in uptake); one of the three project partners has reviewed how additional overtime hours are shared across employees proving social care; one of the three partners has reviewed workplace cleaning rotas to re-consider the need for 'invisibility' of the activity; and access to affordable borrowing and support for savings to all employees has been provided at one of the project partners since the end of the KE project. A detailed summary of the follow-on effect of the key findings at the three project partners is provided in the main report on pages 155 and 156.

In-work poverty and role of the Living Wage (LW)
LW workers are at greater risk of in-work poverty than those employees further up the wage distribution, however risk was experienced across the distribution analysed (employees earning up to &amp;pound;10 per hour) and many LW recipients did not live in households in poverty. Workers at risk of in-work poverty have shorter working hours per week (on average), and workers at risk of in-work poverty are more likely to report a preference or desire for more working hours. 

Employees were supportive of the LW policy that had been adopted at their organisation. For those receiving the LW directly it was welcomed and more than half reported that it made a positive difference to them in terms of their financial circumstances. There was a clear understanding that the extent of the LW impact was a function of hours worked, and this would limit any benefit. 

Additional pathways out of low-pay
Additional pathways investigated to support low-paid employees included consideration of the remuneration packages or employee benefit schemes run in the organisations. There was compelling evidence that the composition of the benefits under these schemes, the methods of communication internally around them, and the confidence employees had in accessing them significantly reduced the value of the benefits for the lower-waged groups in the workforce. 

Career progression was also considered as a route out of low-pay. In a series of direct question about aspirations and progression, more than half of the sample responded that they were not looking for progression. The follow-up qualitative interviews provided some useful context to these findings. For example, that a lack of confidence in themselves, and their skills by lower-waged employees might explain lack of engagement with 'career advancement' when offered. 

The benefit entitlement checks on 40% of completed surveys undertaken by the Welfare Benefit Unit (WBU) in York suggested that roughly 28% of employees were under claiming on benefit entitlement in summer/autumn 2014. Also, within those respondents (c.20%) reporting receipt of working and/or tax credits, there was a higher level of employees receiving the LW.

Sustainability of the Living Wage policy
Implementation of the LW policy has presented challenges at all three organisations but arguably the more significant issues arise around the longer-term embedding or sustainability. Early evidence suggests that for the LW to be fully embedded requires; organisation leads to have a high-level principled commitment to the policy, as well as a deep understanding of what the policy will mean for their organisation in 5-8 years time; and for senior HR colleagues to not only understand the wage policy but be fully committed to its success, as on-going innovative thinking around internal pay structures, wage growth across the distribution and productivity changes will be critical to sustainability.

Summary
Our key findings suggest a complex picture for organisations to engage with if the aim is to be an 'anti-poverty employer'. The risk of in-work poverty relates not only to the wage rate but is also inextricably linked to the working hours. We suggest that employers might wish to engage in a range of additional pathways to help low-waged employees including:

? consideration of their employees' weekly working hours and whether current jobs could be actively re-designed in this dimension e.g. stitching together part-time roles, into more significant employment,
? consideration of the provision, access and engagement of the full workforce to any employee benefit package provided, and
? where career progression is promoted as an answer to low-pay that an underpinning and supportive organisational structure to foster and develop confidence and aspiration within the group it is aimed at is also provided. 

These key findings do not make a case against adopting LW rather they highlight that the effectiveness of the LW as a tool against poverty will be greatest when combined with other measures. Indeed, and as has been noted by other researchers previously it may well be that the LW's greatest contribution to poverty alleviation is actually through a galvanising concept for social campaign and justice.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from our knowledge exchange project should be helpful to a range of policy researchers and HR practitioners that are interested in the question of in-work poverty, and specifically in relation to what employers can do to effectively reduce the risk of in-work poverty with their own workforces. 

Specifically on this we have suggest that employers might wish to engage in a range of additional pathways to help low-waged employees including:

? consideration of their employees' weekly working hours and whether current jobs could be actively re-designed in this dimension e.g. stitching together part-time roles, into more significant employment,
? consideration of the provision, access and engagement of the full workforce to any employee benefit package provided, and
? where career progression is promoted as an answer to low-pay that an underpinning and supportive organisational structure to foster and develop confidence and aspiration within the group it is aimed at is also provided.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5C462E0B-9354-480D-9CE8-E14DF8A80157</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5645c4d47272f2.16135237</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05CA5590-F8F9-481E-A9D7-87CC34AD8CE2</gtr:id><gtr:title>AN EVALUATION OF THE LIVING WAGE: IDENTIFYING PATHWAYS OUT OF IN-WORK POVERTY</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Policy and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/71a92bfcf6d32b0ed855c66428ba19f9"><gtr:id>71a92bfcf6d32b0ed855c66428ba19f9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Swaffield JK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bd695f60aeb2.77195166</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>956A94BB-81E7-41DC-AA44-B4904A658245</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identifying sustainable pathways out of in-work poverty: Follow-up qualitative interviews report on the 'Working Life in York' survey: ESRC Knowledge Exchange Scheme ES/L002086/1</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/837074ed08bd7f308eeba2036133adb6"><gtr:id>837074ed08bd7f308eeba2036133adb6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tunstall RK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bd68dfda9963.98563940</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D59D1A92-74EF-4088-AF77-2AC774C92E00</gtr:id><gtr:title>What's in it for the firms?
