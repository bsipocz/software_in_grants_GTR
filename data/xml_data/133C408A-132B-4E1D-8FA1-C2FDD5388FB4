By intoxicants is meant; ?old world? alcohols and ?new world? tobacco, caffeine, and opiates. While people at the time were aware that intoxicants played a central role in the many changes and processes linking the medieval and modern worlds, orthodox interpretations of 'early modernity' (as the period is termed by historians)&amp;nbsp;insist the opposite.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project challenges this orthodoxy by consulting and linking a range of sources and datasets - ranging from port books detailing the type and volume of coastal trade to legal depositional evidence detailing instances of drinking, and from records of policing and regulation to the inventories of retailers - in order to develop closely contextualised community studies over time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Outcomes include an easily accessible website and database for academics and the wider public; museum displays and public lectures; monographs, articles and volume of essays; and a range of initiatives by which this crucial historical perspective can be brought to bear on current debates and policies regarding intoxicants.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>From debates over binge drinking to arguments over licensing and pricing; from their prominence in cultural life to their lubrication of all manner of sociability; from their importance to public revenues to their centrality to global capitalism; as the markers of social identities or the focus of moral panics: in all these respects intoxicants play a central role in modern societies. A fundamental premise of this project is that these political, economic, social, cultural roles can be traced to early modernity, and that historical data and analysis can enrich contemporary debates and understanding. 
A number of constituencies will accordingly utilise the data and analysis. They include:
a) Public Advisors and Policy Makers: The PI and Co-I have a good record of working with policy makers and strategists, reporting to the Parliamentary Select Committee on Health on the history of public drinking in 2008 and organizing a workshop with the Cambridge Socio-Legal Group and Wellcome in 2011. This project allows these discussions and initiatives to be taken forward. A workshop on 'Intoxication and Society' will be held under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin in 2013. The research team will develop close links with the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the University of Sheffield, running workshops on long-term/short-term patterns of consumption. The data collected through the project will also serve as a basis for participation in meetings of the European Commission's 'Addictions and Lifestyles in Contemporary Europe: Reframing Addictions Project' (ALICE RAP) in 2014 and 2015, which has direct policy implications. The conference in year 3 of the project to consider the policy implications of the research and the findings will be outlined on the 'History and Policy' website based at the University of Cambridge. 
b) Civic and Business Groups: A key aim of the project will be to bring historical data and analysis to the attention of civic and business groups. To this end links will be developed with civic and regulatory bodies such as Drinkaware and the National Organization of Residents Association as well as business associations like the British Beer and Pub Association, the Society of Independent Brewers, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, the Association of Small Direct Wine Merchants, and the Tobacco Manufacturers Association. The aim will be to speak directly to these groups by way of lectures and invited talks and to run a workshop for civic and business representatives in year 3 of the project. Another important constituency for the project is school teachers. The web resource is conceived as a pedagogic as well as research aid, and a conference for teachers in year 3 will introduce them to the resource and also issues relating to social history more generally.
c) Media Agencies: Intoxicants are a subject of perennial public interest and ESRC research by the PI has already attracted media attention. Thus after delivering a public lecture on intoxication at the Cambridge Festival of Ideas in 2011, the PI was interviewed for follow-up articles in The Economist, The German Financial Times, The New Zealand Herald, The Daily Mail, The Daily Telegraph, and the Times Higher Education. He also appeared on BBC Radio Cambridge and Irish Radio. Another useful outlet is the BBC History Magazine. While these contacts will be utilized by the project, the PI will also look to have a programme based on the data and analysis commissioned by TV and/or Radio. 
d) The Wider Public. The project will be able to exploit the unique place of the V&amp;amp;A in British public life by contributing to a new permanent exhibition gallery to be opened in December 2014 on 'Drinking' alongside a programme of public lectures (six already scheduled, one per month starting in December 2014). A website and network (intoxesrc.co.uk) will insure the public presence of the project and the database will be online and free.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>641025</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have done the following public events to March 2016:
