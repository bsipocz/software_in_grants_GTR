Specifically, alkyl-PEG self-assembled monolayers on gold chips will be used to present carbohydrates for biotransformations. Reactions will be monitored directly by MALDI-tof mass spectrometry, or product formation will be assessed indirectly by lectin detection and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1695</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Whilst carbohydrate structure and recognition are clearly central to biology, our appreciation of their structure and function is still rudimentary compared to proteins and nucleic acids.
