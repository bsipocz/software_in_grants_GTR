brain region known as the basal ganglia are essential for making decisions and acting on them. This is shown by the main symptoms of Parkinson?s disease, in which the basal ganglia do not work properly.
Here, we aim to explain how nerve cells in the basal ganglia work together with their partner ?motor circuits? to support purposeful movement. We will focus our efforts on discovering when, why and how different types of nerve cell use special patterns of electrical activity, genes and connections to control behaviour. As an important part of this, we will define how a lack of the chemical dopamine, as occurs in Parkinson?s disease, changes the ways in which these nerve cells interact and how they influence behaviour. This should help us better understand why people with Parkinson?s disease have difficulties with moving. These key issues cannot be addressed by studying humans alone, so we study the ways in which brain cells work in rodents (rats and mice).
This research will provide important new knowledge about how cells in the basal ganglia communicate with each other in health and disease. By defining the unique and complementary roles played by different types of nerve cell during movement, this research will put us in a stronger position to develop new therapies that are better able to manage brain activity and provide improved relief from symptoms in advanced Parkinson?s disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The design of new strategies for treating the symptoms of brain diseases must be tempered by a mature knowledge of how different nerve cell types fulfil their specialised roles to govern behaviour. The overarching goal of this Programme is to deliver high-resolution readouts and mechanistic explanations of brain motor circuit organization in the context of normal behaviours as well as impaired Parkinsonian behaviours. Focusing on the ?motor domains? of the neuronal circuits linking the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebral cortex, we will harness cutting-edge technologies for identifying, accessing and manipulating neurons in vivo to provide fundamental new insights into the specific cellular substrates of the neuronal network dynamics therein. We will place special emphasis on defining how the interactions and activities of identified cell types in these motor circuits vary according to the temporal profile of dopamine release and movement. As a key corollary of this, we will define how a paucity of dopamine release, as occurs in Parkinson?s disease and its animal models, impacts on the neuronal encoding of behaviour in these motor circuits. To achieve our specific aims, we will couple novel and advanced analytical techniques with experimental interventions designed to probe causal interactions between specified circuit elements with high spatiotemporal precision. Our experiments will centre on the use of wild type and genetically-altered rodents with intact or comprised midbrain dopaminergic systems, the readouts from which will straddle multiple levels of function including molecular/genetic, structural, electrophysiological and behavioural. In capitalising on the new level of understanding of the dynamics of identified neurons that will be gained here, we will also exploit specified cell types and other circuit elements as novel points of entry for spatiotemporally-patterned interventions designed to correct circuit dysfunction and related behavioural deficits in advanced Parkinsonism.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2100-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>811000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>I served on the Steering Committee for Brain Diaries, a major exhibition and series of events revealing how the latest neuroscience is transforming what we know about the lifelong development of our brains, from birth to the end of life.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3A5E3FD1-B8AD-4A4B-B6B9-CAC7F2438C2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impacts are being evaluated by the University of Oxford and its partners.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c551831854c3.20356643</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Brain Diaries, Museum of Natural History, Oxford.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/braindiaries/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Alzheimer's Research UK Oxford Drug Discovery Institute</gtr:description><gtr:id>675E2B90-A68B-46C2-89AE-1D582671C32B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Consortium awarded substantial research funding (more than 10 million over 5years).

The placement scheme hosted at the Unit was a first for Oxford, and was tailored for pupils from local state-funded schools to support their progress into university degrees and careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).

During their time in the Unit, the pupils worked alongside Unit scientists and received personalised mentoring to gain a wide variety of practical experiences and learn more about key concepts and challenges in neuroscience and medical research. In a series of integrated workshops with in2scienceUK, the pupils also received guidance on university applications, wider information about STEM careers, and training in transferable skills.

The pupils recorded their experiences and progress in blogs and images. The feedback from the pupils was fantastic, indicating that the experience will have a lasting impact on their outlook and career choices.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>585d34ea5b6737.82312209</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.mrcbndu.ox.ac.uk/news/unit-and-in2scienceuk-deliver-stem-placements-local-school-pupils</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Generating Genius pupils visit to MRC Brain Network Dynamics Unit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63CB9211-77D1-400C-8BE2-21B177B382A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The MRC Brain Network Dynamics Unit welcomed 25 pupils and teachers from state-funded schools in the London area who are enrolled with Generating Genius, a charitable organisation that supports talented young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to realise their potential in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths).

During the visit, small groups of pupils talked informally with MRC Unit members about key concepts and challenges in brain research, as well as what it is like being a scientist. Special emphasis was placed on giving pupils the opportunity to try some 'hands on' science and to see real working laboratories and instruments for themselves.

The visit began with an open and interactive discussion of when, how and why animals are used in medical research. Activities were then coordinated around 4 'knowledge stations', at which pupils could experience some of the Unit's core research themes, including human brain stimulation, the electrical activity of nerve cells, microscopy in neuroscience, the nerve cell networks of memory, and the brain in health and Parkinson's disease.

During their visits, pupils in small groups talked informally to Unit members about key concepts and challenges in brain research, as well as what it is like being a scientist. Special emphasis was also placed on giving pupils the opportunity to try some 'hands on' science and to see real working instruments and laboratories for themselves. Activities were coordinated around different 'knowledge stations', at which pupils could experience some of the MRC Unit's core research themes, including human brain stimulation, computer modelling of brain function, microscopy in neuroscience, the neuronal networks of memory, the brain in health and Parkinson's disease, and the use of animals in research. The Schools Open Day was also attended by the local politicians (MP, Oxford City Councillors).

The pupils were inquisitive and engaged, as evidenced by the barrage of questions! Written feedback from pupils and teachers (and members of the MRC Unit), was very positive.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>585d301826e644.10776495</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.mrcbndu.ox.ac.uk/news/schools-open-day-2016</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1755735</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>New Investigator Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Wellcome Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>101821/Z/13/Z</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>9A4C2A07-CF3D-442E-8E09-5E6B32D89442</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>bcBFAYxVfty</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>12430</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC Project Grant (Response Mode)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/P003796/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>CF636D94-046C-4A4B-9F5F-6DF92988DFC4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>585d3e2b97bca2.52645240</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>293053</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Monument Trust Discovery Award (Renewal)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Parkinson's UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>J-1403</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>47DEC079-F8BC-46CD-B5DF-04C972548930</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464b714a882f2.13059589</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>133400</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Medical Research Foundation</gtr:department><gtr:description>Parkinson's Disease Research Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>MRF-068-0001-RG-MAGIL</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6FBB6FEF-E365-4311-9C2F-3F21249C77A8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>568561cbe44b91.13002967</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience Expert Review Group, The Wellcome Trust.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8CEA3621-59B3-4434-810D-A3CE704C8F9F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464be21a393f7.59366946</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/Biomedical-science/Application-information/Committees/wtx062804.htm</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of Research Advisory Panel of Parkinson's UK</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63F35840-880D-4372-883C-BD44AF965831</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464c15e4a2bb3.60652054</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parkinsons.org.uk/content/research-advisory-panel</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have generated a unique database that contains electrophysiological readouts of single neuron function and neural population dynamics in the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebral cortex of dopamine-depleted Parkinsonian rats and their dopamine-intact controls.

These mice are unique in: (1) expressing the enzyme Cre recombinase in neurons that make the dopamine transporter; and (2) moderately over-expressing wildtype human alpha-synuclein. Expression of Cre recombinase allows highly selective access to midbrain dopamine neurons (which are particularly vulnerable in Parkinsonism) for optogenetic manipulations. Over-expression of human alpha-synuclein recapitulates a genetic burden of relevance for inherited and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (see Janezic et al. (2013) and Dodson et al. (2016) in Publications section). We have also generated the genetic controls for this new mouse line.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2A0D3304-1563-47A2-B3A0-883EB95AEFBC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are using this new mouse line as a research tool, but no definitive impacts yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c52e57c7e377.97674539</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>'Optogenetics-capable' mouse model of Parkinsonism</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5CFE64F9-D634-417A-A6B2-F2ED346C157A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Action initiation shapes mesolimbic dopamine encoding of future rewards.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b307b1f70bedff9c9163dbc51fd297f9"><gtr:id>b307b1f70bedff9c9163dbc51fd297f9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Syed EC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1097-6256</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5685666d4a9cb9.22737112</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2431CD27-79DE-4370-BCBF-2F439B8F75BC</gtr:id><gtr:title>LRRK2 BAC transgenic rats develop progressive, L-DOPA-responsive motor impairment, and deficits in dopamine circuit function.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Human molecular genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fded70b9f465cf72ff34f64458ec5356"><gtr:id>fded70b9f465cf72ff34f64458ec5356</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sloan M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0964-6906</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d5b94ba56f15.65673650</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>753DD6C4-15E1-473A-9C21-CA3EDD4CF63A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transcription factors FOXA1 and FOXA2 maintain dopaminergic neuronal properties and control feeding behavior in adult mice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9ac84e5d9bf96fbc5e0260019152f0e5"><gtr:id>9ac84e5d9bf96fbc5e0260019152f0e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Prister?
