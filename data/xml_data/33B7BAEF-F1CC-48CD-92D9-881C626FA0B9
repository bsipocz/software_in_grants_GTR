In particular, how we can trace what happens to poetry when it encounters music? \n\nBaudelaire's poem 'La Mort des amants' is one of his best known, and is frequently anthologised. One of the principal reasons behind this renown, however, has been largely ignored by critics; namely, the poem's transformation into song only a few years after publication. Baudelaire's friend Villiers de l'Isle-Adam set it to music in the 1860s, and turned it into a popular salon favourite, as is evidenced by reports of audiences who heard Villiers's own performances of the setting. This popularity did not necessarily have a positive effect on the life of the poem. One of the principal issues that this Fellowship will address is how a song setting is able, on the one hand, to give a poem a new lease of life, whilst on the other, also spell the poem's downfall. Removed from the context of _Les Fleurs du mal_, the poem-as-song takes on a completely separate life, attached to the particular melody and harmonisation composed by Villiers. \n\nSuch was the song's popularity that certain responses to it soon degenerated into irritation rather than marvel. In the late 1860s or early 1870s, as a mark of this annoyance, the song was parodied by L&amp;eacute;on Valade and Paul Verlaine in the _Album zutique_, with rather risqu&amp;eacute; words which they claimed were Baudelaire's own set to the same Villiers tune. The effect of this new parodic setting on the life of the original poem meant in fact that the song was bathed in an entirely new (ridiculous) light, whilst the poem itself was tentatively reclaimed as a poem in its own right. Baudelaire was no stranger to parody and caricature, but by the time of the Valade/Verlaine collaborative re-working of 'La Mort des amants' into 'La Mort des cochons' he was no longer alive. Thus it is Villiers who ends up coming off worse, since he is still alive and able to feel the effects of the parodic force. this respect, I suggest that the what Valade and Verlaine do for Baudelaire in the 1870s is to enable the poem to be released from the shackles of the Villiers setting, reanimating the poem outside of the domain of music.\n\nVilliers's take on the Baudelaire poem will prove long-lasting. The poem-as-song takes another path that re-establishes the link with music, and finds itself being re-set by other poet-composers, including Maurice Rollinat, and by more established composers, namely Claude Debussy and Gustave Charpentier. This longevity is due, in part, to another seminal figure who lurks behind the work of these poets and composers: Richard Wagner. Villiers's letter to Baudelaire in 1861 goes so far as to suggest that 'La Mort des amants' is the poem in which Baudelaire has applied his 'th&amp;eacute;ories musicales'. Precisely what Baudelaire's theory of music might be, however, is far from self-explanatory. It is clear that Villiers's comment comes in the context of Baudelaire's own recent publication of his essay on Wagner, and yet Villiers's musical setting of Baudelaire's poem does not seem to incorporate any Wagnerian elements whatsoever (it is left to Debussy twenty years later to (re-)insert Wagner into the musical text). Wagner's ambivalent status (which translates into music's ambivalent status), the question of a Baudelairean theory of music, and the significance of parody to safeguard poetry from song, will form the central elements of my research. In so doing, this project will also address broader issues of methodology, scope and aims of words/music research.\n\nThe principal output of this Fellowship will be a six-chapter monograph, in which analysis of the cultural environment of the late nineteenth century in Paris will be supported by close textual readings of both poetic text(s) and musical text(s). The monograph will be accompanied by recordings of the relevant song settings (especially previously un-recorded material) and by live performances.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Building on the impact of an extremely successful collaboration with an artist in residence (professional pianist) funded by The Leverhulme Trust Jan-Oct 2009, I have tried and tested platforms in place in order to disseminate my research to a wider audience beyond the main academic beneficiaries.

On the 150th anniversary of the birth of Claude Debussy, Richard Langham Smith relishes the lyrical riches of Th&amp;eacute;odore de Banville, Alfred de Musset, Paul Bourget, Th&amp;eacute;ophile Gautier and Paul Verlaine, the poets Debussy chose to express his love for an older, married woman, Marie Blanche Vasnier.

Hearing her sing moved Debussy, then an impressionable young student, to create a treasury of songs specially with her voice in mind. Among the many songs he wrote for Madame Vasnier, is the unpublished &amp;quot;La fille aux cheveux de lin&amp;quot;. It was the starting point of Debussy's fascination with setting words to music, an obsession that reached a high point in &amp;quot;P&amp;eacute;lleas et M&amp;eacute;lisande&amp;quot; some twenty years later. But it's Madame Vasnier Debussy acknowledges as &amp;quot;the only muse to ever inspire musical feelings&amp;quot;, and that's he confesses, &amp;quot;only to talk of the musical ones!&amp;quot;.

This research presents for the first time transcriptions and recordings of previously unknown early (popular) song settings of Baudelaire in relation to more 'canonical' settings by Claude Debussy.

Working in close conjunction with professional performers in word/music research projects is essential in terms of developing a broader understanding of what is at stake, as it enables researchers to negotiate the releationship between the poetic text and the song score in ways that move beyond 'standard' literary / musical analysis techniques.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Concerts, performances, recordings, including music to accompany art exhibitions of mid-to-late 19th-century painters.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>178DCA49-C193-485A-9347-376F1139E2EE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6790802773.8247097760543e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://helenabbott.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D995A455-2063-42E8-9112-07B48E91288A</gtr:id><gtr:title>EDITORIAL: Poetry, Performance, Music in Nineteenth-Century France</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Dix-Neuf</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/794551d6a836d895714a75ce386d993d"><gtr:id>794551d6a836d895714a75ce386d993d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbott H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545cb653903f00.67445659</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6AD3C40E-E7B2-4787-8054-32F1AE7993DB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Critical Insights: The Poetry of Baudelaire</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e0a8f27328976848ad019d2cdfa9855b"><gtr:id>e0a8f27328976848ad019d2cdfa9855b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbott, H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-61925-395-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545cb728b6cf63.38882348</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6BE9C649-39F8-4EB2-9A2C-A051BF2CE87D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parisian Intersections: Baudelaire's Legacy to Composers</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d8137c18eb6b9ee5bbc54607d8bf60a3"><gtr:id>d8137c18eb6b9ee5bbc54607d8bf60a3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbott, Helen</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-3-0343-0805-2</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_27294978773c097e0a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I002286/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47D79871-3D9E-42F7-83E1-354D081901C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
