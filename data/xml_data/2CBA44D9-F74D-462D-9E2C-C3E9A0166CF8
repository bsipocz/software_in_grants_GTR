On the basis of research into the collections and their histories, a series of temporary installations and will be produced for the museum that will reflect critically on some of the subtexts of the Museum's history, ranging over varied past and present interests in objects in the collections, the nature of the institution, the design of displays, and their architectural contexts, as well as the deeper ideological and political assumptions behind them. The interventions may include rewriting signage and interpretive texts, the redisplay of objects, new juxtapositions, the inclusion of new material, like contemporary artworks, into the museum context. Some interventions will be experienced digitally, others within the physical context of the building and the present displays. Both subtle and minimal, and more ambitious in scope, interventions will attempt to alter the experience of the museum as a whole, or propose ways in which it might be radically altered.\n\nAn exhibition with invited artists who are similarly concerned with anthropology and the display of artefacts from non-Western cultures will also take place and again the aim is to invite audiences to question assumptions behind and within these types of collections and their display in the present day. The concept behind the interventions and the exhibition is to invite audiences and other stakeholders in the museum (curators, students and teachers in related disciplines) to reflect on their relationship with the material and to consider ourselves in relation to the act of collecting and display. Rather than judging collectors from a previous age for their imperialist ambitions, I am more interested in seeing similarities in how we acquire curios from our own travels today and how we make sense of our experiences with other cultures.\n\nInformed by a sustained period of research into this museum's history, into debates about collecting and collections, and wide-ranging evaluation of contemporary artistic interventions in museums, these interventions and the exhibition will aim to highlight the various tensions within the collection's display. While it is widely presumed that ethnographic collections are made up essentially of imperial loot, in fact the objects in collections today reached institutions in diverse ways, some were legitimately bought, some received by collectors as gifts, or were bartered or traded, and a considerable amount of material was in fact produced for collectors or researchers, in effect commissioned in the field. Some were forged or faked by Europeans, some to be sure was stolen or seized during armed conflict. The variety of stories behind these objects are often obscured, variously by the rationalities of classificatory displays, and sometimes by overwhelming political or religious perspectives. The telling of their stories is complex; this series of exhibitions, and associated outcomes, such as conference talks, will take on the nuances of the collection, the history of their display, and attempt to draw out the sometimes quirky and haphazard reason for their coming to be collected and seen.\n\nThe exhibition series will culminate in making a 'wunderkammer', a cabinet of curiosities, as a mobile museum in miniature. The wunderkammer will take ideas honed by my work with the museum into a wider context, reflecting on the relationship between the collector and the collected in the contemporary context. It will explore a wider idea of collections and their display taking insights gleaned from working with artists and curators from other cultures with collections and artefacts from the past into the present with our contemporary context of global travel and collections of foreign curios. This wunderkammer will be exhibited in contemporary art galleries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>233081</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>8min DVD and new collection of cannibal forks made by staff and scholars at the Museum of Archaeology &amp;amp; Anthropology, University of Cambridge.

The research did indeed produce complex and effective work that reflected on the relationship between 'collector' and 'collected', acknowledging that this is not the simple binary it first appears to be. Specifically, it was through an engagement that was open and yet rigorous with the disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, while also maintaining the knowledge specific to contemporary art practice, that this nuance and complexity emanated. Originally, like the artistic precedents cited in my application, my focus was on institutional critique and an assumption that the institution requires art to serve as its conscience, bringing to light the less-than-auspicious colonial origins of its collections and displays, or the ongoing impact of these. It was because of the process of research as an artist and research within this inter-disciplinary environment that the work was able to move beyond the somewhat simplistic binaries that continue to find favour within the larger artworld. The artworks that formed part of the research process became more nuanced through their engagement with the scholarship and findings of colleagues in other disciplines. While our areas of research may have overlapped, (for example, nineteenth century Fiji at the point of its accession to Britain) what became clear was that the discipline of art is interested in different knowledge, ideas or stories that can be drawn from the same set of 'data' shared by historians and anthropologists and that, not only do we have 'creative outputs' but we ask different questions from historians or anthropologists. It was through this inter-disciplinary engagement that the research travelled in an unexpected direction. Not only was the research conducted in terms of the relationship between collections, collectors and the collected, but it also involved an analysis and reflection on art practice as a discipline in its own right, and the inter-disciplinary research process created the understanding that art is capable of producing knowledge akin to any other academic discipline.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are two findings from this research project that have potential impact. The first is understanding afresh the potential for art in museums and inter-disciplinary work with artists in non-art contexts and the second is understanding art as a knowledge-forming discipline. I would also hope that artists and curators will move beyond the stereotypes of both institutional critique and ethnography (taking on board the findings of the ostensible content of my research) but I feel this is less likely. Instead I hope to influence directors and curators of museums, particularly ethnographic museums, to reflect on the uses and abuses of contemporary art by museums and to help commission art to do something important in artistic terms. I also hope to influence the direction of art and particularly the understanding of the potential for art as research at doctoral and post-doctoral levels (as distinct from all other types of art practice).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>16889A7C-E806-4DCA-89CC-27DECA700BB9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545e3ddc722303.75996319</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>004613F1-A1E1-40EE-9608-C0CB5F0B09B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>This is Not Art: Activism and Other 'not-art'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1215a9a802e4fbf598d524ff421ea655"><gtr:id>1215a9a802e4fbf598d524ff421ea655</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jelinek Alana</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781848858572</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_77333848243bf3f1ca</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>934E3FDF-A3CE-4781-B400-A8825E9D30E3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Deschooling Society</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Visual Culture</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b9e30e9edf0d6d46c7f2ad105794b051"><gtr:id>b9e30e9edf0d6d46c7f2ad105794b051</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jelinek A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d07a07a683dbd7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6D4DCB11-6A1D-4A90-A537-6CE161877D2B</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Response to the Issues Raised in the Special Edition of</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ethnos</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b9e30e9edf0d6d46c7f2ad105794b051"><gtr:id>b9e30e9edf0d6d46c7f2ad105794b051</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jelinek A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7957a06e726.30452293</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4302C368-7211-4968-849A-F6DE221A40B9</gtr:id><gtr:title>An artist's response to an anthropological perspective (Grimshaw and Ravetz)</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Anthropology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b9e30e9edf0d6d46c7f2ad105794b051"><gtr:id>b9e30e9edf0d6d46c7f2ad105794b051</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jelinek A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7bb0e05fb39.69332822</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A3A6179E-EDF5-4F26-9505-3388917541F2</gtr:id><gtr:title>This is Not Art: Activism and Other 'not-art'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1215a9a802e4fbf598d524ff421ea655"><gtr:id>1215a9a802e4fbf598d524ff421ea655</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jelinek Alana</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781848858565</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_68411722853bf3f0bc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F016085/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
