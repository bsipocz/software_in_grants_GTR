Harper's Weekly, 7 April 1866\n\n'Free from all Utopian ideas, he acted upon men and things as he found them, not as they ought to be.' Senator George Williams of Oregon, 14 December 1869\n\nThis is a highly significant project. The Civil War was a watershed event in modern American history and William Pitt Fessenden played a central role in the advent, progress, and outcome of that vicious conflict. Fessenden (1806-69) was one of the most influential American legislators of the 19th century. Gaining his political education as a Whig in the Maine legislature and a single term in the US House of Representatives, he, like many antislavery Whigs including Abraham Lincoln, remained in the nation's political wilderness until his career was rekindled by the process of political realignment that culminated in the emergence of the new Republican party in the mid-1850s. In January 1854 Fessenden was elected to the US Senate. Apart from a brief interlude as Secretary of the Treasury in Lincoln's wartime cabinet, he remained in post until his death. \n\nThe senator's primary importance lies in the fact that he was the outstanding moderate Republican in Congress at a time when the Republican party dominated policymaking in an expansive nation, the very existence of which was threatened by ruinous internal strife over slavery extension. Despite acknowledging the contribution made by the moderates to federal policy, modern scholars -- certainly since the days of the civil rights movement -- have been keener to chart the relatively progressive racial views of radical antislavery politicians like Thaddeus Stevens, Salmon Chase and Charles Sumner than the actions of the more pragmatic moderates. Yet in the final analysis it was the moderates who determined the course of events. Of these influential centrists only Lincoln has continued to attract the attention of historians whereas Stevens, Chase and Sumner have all been the subject of recent biographies. There is a need to redress the balance.\n\nIn focusing on either the presidency of Abraham Lincoln or the actions of leading radicals, historians have failed to assess adequately the contribution made by Congress to the Union war effort or to probe the criticial relationship between the president and the wartime Congress. James M. McPherson and William J. Cooper contend in their comprehensive overview of recent Civil War scholarship that while the roles of [Confederate] President [Jefferson] Davis and President Lincoln have been thoroughly examined, the impact of their respective Congresses -- which was considerable, especially in the North -- has been neglected.' Fessenden, an ardent advocate of practical, common-sense legislation, was one of the most effective leaders in the Civil War Senate owing largely to his willingness to set aside his scruples about centralising legislation for the duration of the war. In this respect as well as in that of his successful tenure as Secretary of the Treasury, he made a major contribution to northern victory. \n\nFessenden went on to play a defining role in Reconstruction, a remarkable period in US history when the Republican-controlled Congress acted to protect and advance the rights of millions of recently liberated slaves. He chaired the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, wrote the committee's influential report which served as the Republicans' principal campaign document in the critical 1866 mid-term elections, and finally broke with the radicals to vote against the impeachment of conservative president Andrew Johnson. This study will probe the personal, political and intellectual reasons for Fessenden's alienation from the radicals and in so doing enhance our understanding of the limits of Republican policymaking in the controversial sphere of race relations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-06-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27696</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E003443/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
