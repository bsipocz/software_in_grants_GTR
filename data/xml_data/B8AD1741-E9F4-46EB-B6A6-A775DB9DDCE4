offering new services with Small Unmanned Aircraft (SUA) for civilian customers.
SUA is a CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) classification covering aircraft weighing less than
7Kg and requiring minimal regulations over their operations in UK airspace.
This requires research to quantify what the market wants or is likely to want in future; to
assess
and evaluate emerging and latent technologies that can meet these requirements; and to
understand the likely regulatory and legal framework that these craft will have to operate in.
All three are needed in order to for businesses to offer professional and commercial grade
services.
There are good indicators that the the market for SUA for civilian applications is growing
globally. In the UK, current use of SUAs is mainly as platforms for video and photography
for the leisure market with some use in industrial survey and public service roles such as the
police. The long term commercial viability of these is still uncertain. Industry and the user
community propose more novel applications and services such as: ability to carry different
payloads such as IR, radar, air quality sniffers, noise monitoring, more autonomous
operations with on board intelligence to allow and ?sense-and-avoid?, enable handover,
evasive manoeuvre under specific conditions, wider use in disaster management, monitoring
land use and other applications.
However none of these are likely to see commercial operations while developments of such
craft are largely uncoordinated and left to the vendors to drive forward as no one is sure what
the market for this segment is likely to be.
We believe there is a huge potential market both in the UK and globally for SUA services
suited for the civilian professional market. But this requires sustained and coordinated
marketing and R &amp;amp; D
effort, which is the purpose of this project</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">700361</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
