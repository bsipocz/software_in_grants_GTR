The Alliance has set a deadline of 2014 to terminate its combat mission in Afghanistan and it is clear that NATO is now heading for a period of retrenchment. The limited intervention in Libya and the failure to act in Syria are markers of lowered ambition and a loss of confidence in the utility of force.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yet crisis and retrenchment sit alongside an ability to adapt. NATO has reformed its command structures, enlarged its membership, undertaken a variety of out-of-area operations and developed a wide range of security tasks - missile defence, anti-piracy missions, cyber defence and security-sector reform among others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The crisis-durability nexus in NATO is not theoretically well understood and this series aims to test theoretical assumptions against policy practice. The series also has a number of practical objectives:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to connect academic, practitioner and civil society networks&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to generate recommendations on UK-NATO relations and UK security and defence policy&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to reach judgements on NATO?s operational and organisational development&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to consider the normative implications of NATO action.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The benefits to the academic and policy community lie in the development of a group of NATO scholars connected, in turn, to the broader community of scholarship in International Relations (and its disciplinary sub-sets: Security Studies, Peace Studies, Strategic Studies etc.). This will result in a range of joint activities and outputs (detailed in Pathways to Impact).

Practitioners will be drawn from UK government agencies, NATO member-country embassies and permanent delegations, NATO officials (based at NATO HQ, Brussels and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe [SHAPE], Mons) and officials from a number of other relevant international organisations (these are detailed in the Case for Support). This practitioner network is diverse and scattered across a range of agencies. Access will be facilitated by the formal links enjoyed by co-applicants Smith and Hallams to UK defence and security bodies given their training roles at Sandhurst and Shrivenham. Both have considerable experience of engagement with users in presenting and organising policy and academic related materials. For practitioners, the benefits lie in their exposure to policy-relevant empirical, critical and theoretical materials provided by academics, and their direct involvement in dialogue with both academic and NGO participants. Practitioners, further, will be involved directly in the seminars as presenters and, where possible, will contribute to dissemination (through contributions to blogs and short on-line commentaries).

NGO and civil society actors will also be beneficiaries. This will include a number of London and Brussels-based think tanks (the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Egmont - the Royal Institute for International Relations etc.) as well as bodies of policy advocacy such as the NATO Watch, the British-American Security Information Council and the Brussels-based ISIS-Europe. Each maintains dedicated web-spaces which will be utilised to disseminate seminar materials. These groups will also participate directly in seminar activities and will benefit from the dialogue with practitioners and academics - a three-way dialogue rare in this policy area. 

The seminar series will contribute to the broad public and policy dialogue currently in train on the lessons learnt from the Afghan and Libyan campaigns. By engaging directly with NATO and national officials as well as opinion formers, the seminars provide an opportunity for critical and open dialogue on an issue of central concern to UK foreign policy. The seminars' aim, therefore, is to enhance evidence-based policy making and specifically to:

- connect academic, practitioner and civil society networks;
- generate recommendations on UK-NATO relations and UK security and defence policy;
- reach informed judgements on the operational and organisational development of NATO and transatlantic relations; 
- consider the normative implications if NATO action (and thus contribute to policy-relevant debates on humanitarian intervention and Responsibility to Protect).

Dissemination of seminar discussion and findings is essential to furthering these objectives. In addition to the activities outlined in Pathways to Impact, the PI will ensure a prominent media profile for each seminar utilising the marketing facilities at the University of Birmingham. Local media partners will also be utilised. This will entail invitations to security correspondents of national newspapers for the London-based seminar and international correspondents (Financial Times, International Herald Tribune) for the meeting in Brussels.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17901</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British International Studies Association Model NATO</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F310911A-467D-49A2-BB77-5395E004F801</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of information on NATO with role playing activity

P-I has been involved in two 'catalyst' meetings (in London and Brussels) organised by the Institute for Conflict Cooperation and Security, University of Birmingham, on the Ukraine crisis attended by government officials and NGOs (these were held in January 2015).

P-I was a co-author of the University of Birmingham Policy Commission on 'The Security Impact of Drones', which has had considerable media attention since its publication in September 2014. 

The P-I has been invited to a workshop in Bologna, Italy, in October 2015 organised by NATO's Allied Command Transformation which will consider the agenda for the July 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FC529FDE-22C1-4124-88EF-12E6F66A1548</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55602cce931170.08426828</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Five seminars were held as follows:
1. Royal United Services Institute, London, December 2012 (36 participants) 
2. Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, June 2013 (45 participants) 
3. University of Birmingham, September 2013 (30 participants)
4. UK Defence Academy, Shrivenham, January 2014 (33 participants)
5. Brussels, May 2014 (27 participants) 

The themes of the seminars conformed (with minor amendment) to those in the application. Programmes and attendance lists are available upon request (for scheduled participants per seminar, see bracketed figures above). Attendance was by invitation only, with repeat participation in some cases. Unsolicited requests for attendance were accommodated in every instance, although these were low in number. The size of attendance was reasonably large for a seminar format with participants ranging across NGOs, academia, government, international organisations (including NATO) and the military. We were able to strike a balance between this large number and active and informed participation. 
The main activity of the award was the seminars themselves but contacts generated gave rise to the investigators being involved in parallel meetings on related themes at seminars in Oslo (Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies), Moscow (Institute of Europe) and Vancouver (Simon Fraser University in collaboration with the NATO Defence College).
Seminars were held under the Chatham House Rule. Summaries of individual seminars have, in some cases, been disseminated (Sandhurst Occasional Paper 16, 2013); a web site is under development to mount materials relevant to the series as a whole.
The main findings of the Seminar Series are:
- the proposition that 'NATO is in crisis' was evident as a narrative construct, but the starting assumption of our original proposal that NATO was versatile and adaptable was affirmed;
- that versatility is evident in various technical areas of defence collaboration and in operations (the latter has been apparent in Afghanistan, and the former has become more important as national defence budgets have been reduced); discussions with experts in government and NATO were essential in teasing out this crucial finding; 
- the drawdown in Afghanistan is part of a broader picture of a Western (and thus NATO) retreat from global military engagement (important here was Seminar 2, which focussed on the Syrian crisis and NATO's distance from that conflict);
- the attenuation of its activities does not diminish NATO's importance for its members. The organisational, technical, operational and political benefits of the Alliance continue to be evident. For different reasons, this is true for large (US) and medium (UK) military powers as well as small and vulnerable ones. These considerations align with both instititionalist and realist interpretations of NATO;
- the paradox of NATO (highlighted in our proposal) is clear: an organisation often criticised as ineffectual and in crisis, nonetheless survives as the principal vehicle of transatlantic and pan-European defence cooperation. Why does this paradox persist? There are two explanations. First, because it has adapted so successfully since the end of the Cold War, NATO has become the victim of inflated expectations. And second, NATO's unique military, political and institutional assets make it the natural choice for action in the absence of workable alternatives. (The latter point was one conclusion of Seminar 5 at which the crisis in Ukraine was considered);
- in an age of defence austerity and a broadened security agenda involving often irresolvable problems, NATO needs to steer toward an agenda that is modest but achievable. That agenda should (and, to some degree, does) entail an Alliance commitment to policies of readiness, reassurance and renewal. (See sources immediately below for an elaboration of this finding). 

The Seminars' findings are summarised in a short article by the PI currently under consideration for the ESRC's annual Britain in 2015. The major published outcome is an article co-authored by the three co-investigators - 'Repairing NATO's Motors', International Affairs, Vol.90(4), July 2014.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>All investigators are involved in UK-based policy networks. These have been strengthened and developed by the seminar series. 

For the last six years, the PI has led student delegations to Washington D.C. to participate in Model NATO organised by Howard and Kent State Universities. The insights drawn from the Seminar Series will inform delegation preparations for the February 2015 Model. The PI is also the lead academic convenor (on behalf of the British International Studies Association) of a sixth-form Model NATO being held in September 2014 at the University of South Wales to coincide with the actual NATO summit occurring nearby at Celtic Manor. Preparation of the agenda and briefings for students and teachers has been informed by material obtained in the Seminar Series.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>57CF4247-AEF3-4E44-B7C2-C40D8305220C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5430fec25c7ac0.57171320</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_publication_docs/90_4_WebberHallamsSmith.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6A9F6DBA-50CC-4837-A7E8-5FADF37F2C0A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Repairing NATO's motors</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Affairs</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dfb589bc0e332d5648f2814f9a22ef24"><gtr:id>dfb589bc0e332d5648f2814f9a22ef24</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>WEBBER M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5430ff9e672137.53225380</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A120F1F6-5FC1-4044-8D7C-891DB89CFBB0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Security governance in Europe: a return to system</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Security</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e0f8c3b686018e011ecad6218a28c3a3"><gtr:id>e0f8c3b686018e011ecad6218a28c3a3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sperling J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54630fad34c2c4.81282485</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5A79BC62-4282-42C5-B3C4-29FB5278530F</gtr:id><gtr:title>'NATO: Crisis, What Crisis?'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Great Decisions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e79860529f1f3b62438c47fefc84a4b4"><gtr:id>e79860529f1f3b62438c47fefc84a4b4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mark Webber</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>543101b2e6de26.89045492</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DDD4D456-5FBC-4144-93CA-6EC2FFBA9429</gtr:id><gtr:title>NATO beyond 9/11</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9d109d2ed80b2c2012da9d4ebf8ee6b2"><gtr:id>9d109d2ed80b2c2012da9d4ebf8ee6b2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Webber M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54630e71585541.20387984</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J022063/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
