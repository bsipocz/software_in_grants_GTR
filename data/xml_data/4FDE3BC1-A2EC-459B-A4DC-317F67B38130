Economic Incentives (Part 2 of the call)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I000232/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Extensive work has been carried out on the technological, economic and societal potential for better management of energy demand. Huge potential of demand side management can only be exploited by exploring new ways to induce shifts of demand during peaks and hence reduce marginal costs. Digital communication technology can play a vital role in inducing this shift by enabling communication between the devices and the users. A holistic view of the interaction of all key-players - energy devices, energy supplier and energy users - is missing and this project aims at investigating this interaction using a multidisciplinary research team. The overall objective of this research is to evaluate the feasibility of using network technologies and sensor devices now being used in telecommunications, to create a Persuasive Energy-conscious Network (PEN) in a real life pilot setting and then study the potential impact on user behaviour leading to reductions in, and shifts in patterns of, loads of electricity. The project will aim to quantify the savings in carbon footprint (and operational energy cost) of the pilot test-bed when digital technologies (PEN) are deployed. It will also study the response of the users of the proposed monitoring and control system. As part of this research project, we will establish an autonomous self learning network of the sensors, energy consuming devices and users of energy. Self descriptive devices will be enabled to send meta-data describing relevant details of their energy consumption and context (time, task urgency etc.). The network will collect the data and create an energy consumption knowledge-base. The novel middleware will be incorporated that will run the modules of self learning and decision making to trigger actions that will shape the energy demand using specified goals. For this purpose, we will use the University of Surrey campus as initial test-bed.Technological interventions are more likely to achieve the intended energy savings if the interventions are designed with an understanding of how users view and interact with their energy systems. Within psychology, a wealth of research is available which shows that the type and format of information given to users can have a strong influence on their response. We know very little about how individuals may respond to flexible intelligent systems. We aim to examine the behavioural responses to the implementation of intelligent technologies that aim to reduce energy use in buildings.There are various ways of incentivising consumers to change load patterns. One of them is through financial models aimed at fostering the demand responsiveness of consumers. Those consumers who proactively engage in reducing or shifting their loads and significantly react to price signals should be rewarded by paying less for their electricity consumption. Part of this research will focus on the development of a financial model for an incentive/payment scheme and testing such financial models on the campus test-bed.As an outcome of the research we will deliver a pilot test bed for the autonomous and self learning Persuasive Energy-conscious Network. The psychological studies will be reported on likely expected behavioural responses of the users to the proposed technologies. A financial model will be implemented and its impact on energy demand transformation will be provided with quantified results of savings in terms of energy cost and CO2 emissions.The research will have targeted collaboration with the users of research such as the industrial researchers (e.g. Thales Research and Technologies), individual energy users (University students and staff) and corporate users of energy (University of Surrey's Estates and Facilities) and government bodies (Woking Borough Council) to highlight the potential of using the digital technology in meeting the requirements of these players in this research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impacts of REDUCE will fall into four areas; - General public as consumers of energy who will benefit via reduced energy bills and a feeling of more personalised control over their energy usage. - Energy supply companies who will increase the efficiency of their operations and thus costs and overheads aiding reduced energy costs. - The environmental lobby and hence Government Policy who will benefit by reduced national carbon footprints aiding compliance with international protocols. - Specific recommendations for the HE sector which is currently consuming 5.2 billion kWh of energy at a cost of more than 200 million pa. The benefits will be captured in terms of; - Reduction of energy usage by measurements from trials in the University and the community. - Generation of innovative applications of sensor networks to increase their penetration in everyday life. - User perceptions, reactions and potential institutional responses to incentives evaluated from the trails. - National models of carbon savings validated by the trials and national roll out guidelines for implementation. The management of impact will be via the Surrey Knowledge Transfer Account (KTA) and the details are provided in the attached Impact Plan. Engagement mechanisms have commenced in other specific areas under KTA from which REDUCE will benefit. For example; - Platform advisory boards - formation of sector/community groups - show cases to sectors-'show and tell' events - follow-up's on a one-to one basis to discuss involvement - regional SME events - sector needs analyses - flexible inward and outbound secondments For REDUCE we will set up a dedicated impact board and a community group with whom we will consult regularly. This will comprise technologists, economists, psychologists, economists and policy makers. Engagement will be focussed on; - users and the energy managers- University of Surrey's Estates and Facilities department has pledged its support. - energy companies and distributers via the trials and community groups. - industry, telecoms operators, manufacturers and software producers via existing KTA platform. Thales Research and Technology has pledged support. - local authorities via the trail with Woking Borough Council (WBC) and hence the association of local authorities - Government via the appropriate Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) committees. Awareness for REDUCE outcomes will be created more generally in the press, trade literature and in policy arena. This will be managed within the KTA by the dedicated communications with the personnel associated with the Platforms. One important role of the KTA is exploitation and the knowledge exchange Directors act as discoverers of Intellectual Property (IP) and connectors to the external needs and requirements. They match the needs of industry to the research outputs in the University and shape research accordingly-open innovation. An important outcome of REDUCE will be its take up and roll out in the community. We see this being done via local authority housing institutions as well as the private sector in terms of the workplaces. Higher education institutes and their campuses can benefit in particular from the University of Surrey's pilot example. Partnerships with the researchers in industry and energy companies and distributors will be essential in generating a business model. For specific elements we see exploitation in the communications networks and sensor/equipment manufacture as well as the middleware production. These will be handled by the existing KTA platform in Communication and Signal Processing (CSP). The KTA will use mechanisms to accelerate exploitation including; - flexible inwards and outwards personnel exchange/consultancy - funding early stage prototypes - funding demonstrators for use by industry to develop and test products - connecting researchers with key external partners. - management of IP issues within the networ</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1147554</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>IBM</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>IBM UK Ltd</gtr:department><gtr:description>Eco-Island, the Isle of Wight sustainability project</gtr:description><gtr:id>13733C68-3554-49AB-B56B-0A9C08D88787</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b970937eb970939c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Discussions at an advanced stage with Eco-Island, the Isle of Wight sustainability project, to conduct behavioural research with island residents.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Thameswey Energy</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Thameswey UK (working with Woking Borough Council)</gtr:description><gtr:id>47A06DBD-201A-47BB-A6EF-923DE8AF4E2F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9709590b97095a4-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Joint work to assess the multidisciplinary implications for using ICT and incentives to reshape energy behaviour of users in social housing.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Student Switch Off</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Student Switch Off Program Discussion</gtr:description><gtr:id>F7FFA078-4565-4A8B-BF11-CE52EE3432BD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d7a10eb9d7a122-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Dr Neil Jennings, coordinator of the nationwide project, 'Student Switch Off' was invited to a REDUCE meeting to discuss his findings as well as our own.

Michael has been worked on behalf of Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) with respect to Electricity Market Reforms. At the UKWEC event in 2011, Michael and Peter discussed the importance of demand side response in electricity markets. From their discussions and their own review it became clear that there was a need for evidence on the economic case for demand side response in the UK. Since this time Peter has generated a working paper that explores and clearly articulates the various forms of demand response and associated costs and benefits for these different forms of demand response. A copy of this paper and key findings and recommendations have been disseminated to Michael Gibbons. In this way REDUCE has reflexively collaborated and worked in partnership with policy makers to provide policy and academic relevant research.

Brief summary is as follows: The penetration of ICT technology is exponentially growing and the predictions suggest that shortly each individual will have hundreds of wireless enabled devices connected together - leading to the so-called 'internet of things'. This will result in a huge increase in energy demand. Developing a means of allowing these devices to manage and minimise their own energy consumption, and help their users adapt more energy-conscious choices can start to make these devices part of the solution rather than part of the problem. The current attitude is to make ICT more efficient; we are trying to use ICT to make people adopt more energy-efficient behaviours. In order to achieve our ambitious goals, a holistic view of the interaction of all key-players - energy devices, energy supplier and energy users - is missing and this project aims at investigating this interaction using a multidisciplinary research team. 



REDUCE is an EPSRC-funded (Digital Economy initiative of Transforming Energy Demand through Digital Innovation) research project led by Dr Muhammad Imran of the Centre for Communication Systems Research at the University of Surrey. We aim to identify the user as the key pressure point for consumption change and using ICT to develop a dialogue between the energy using devices and the users, creating a benevolent feedback cycle. Every user is different, so the devices must be given a 'machine intelligence&amp;quot; to enable them to learn user-centric and context appropriate behaviour. Gradually the system will tune in to the user, and the user will become more comfortable with the system.

REDUCE impact on Green Impact Awards Compaign - University of Surrey:
The research findings from REDUCE, outlined in the White Paper on Energy Use in Offices at the University of Surrey UK, were used in the Green Impact Awards campaign at the University of Surrey. This campaign for energy reduction targeted at university staff was launched in Autumn 2013. Energy savings from the campaign will be further evaluated.

Specific findings on actual energy behaviours and barriers to reducing energy in the university have been incorporated into the communications of the Green Awareness campaign.

Beneficiaries: Sustainability Campaign Officer; University staff

Contribution Method: Specific findings on actual energy behaviours and barriers to reducing energy in the university have been incorporated into the communications of the Green Awareness campaign.

Highlights of Academic Impact:
The project has successfully published several high quality journal articles (many of them with multidisciplinary authors teams) in order to create impact in wider academic community. This includes a paper in Energy Policy with multidisciplinary co-authors. We expect that these findings will be used by general public to change the energy consumption of users in office environments as well the development of related technologies. Three conference papers also won best paper awards in their respective conferences which demonstrates the quality of the work presented as well as the interest of the academic audience in this research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C5ABCCE6-0172-43A0-9EE9-0F2DEEA5EBB1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-1794464077.609092de25b888</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Aim:
The overall objective of this research was to Reshape Energy Demand Using ICT (REDUCE). We approached this aim by evaluating the feasibility of using network technologies and sensor devices to study the potential impact on user behaviour in terms of reductions in, and shifts in patterns of electricity consumption. Additionally, the project aimed to quantify the reduction in carbon footprint (and operational energy cost) when such digital technologies are deployed.

Methodology:
Data was obtained through a number of methods. Questionnaires and interviews were used to capture qualitative/quantitative data. To study the use of communications technology as part of the project's aims, we developed a sensor network testbed which was constructed and deployed at the University's Centre for Communications Systems Research, which consisted of a number of Persuasive Energy Network (PEN) units. These units are capable of measuring the energy consumed, presence, light levels, noise &amp;amp; temperature at each desk where a PEN unit was installed.

Case-study:
Two distinct case studies were undertaken as part of the REDUCE project. The first was a trial conducted in an office setting with more than 150 PEN's being installed at individual office desks. The goal was to study the participant's energy usage behaviour, with some of the participants given the opportunity to receive feedback through a widget installed on their desk computer.

The second was a trial conducted in a residential setting consisting of ten households. During this trial, we explored financial incentive approaches to reducing peak electricity demand in the home. This was the first study on the use of specific financial incentives for load-shifting (as opposed to the introduction of new tariffs) in the residential sector. 

Findings:
We found that at least half of the electricity consumed by office PCs is when people are not at their desks. As much as 73% of electricity consumption by office PCs could be saved and, if all were switched off when the trial participants head home for the evening, an estimated &amp;pound;60,000 could be saved annually. 

For the residential trial, peak reductions as large as 27% were observed when reductions in energy use are also taken into account. As a result, the proportion of off-peak usage rose from an average of 30% to more than 40%. Although this was only a small-scale study, and further research is needed, this suggests that this incentives-based study was able to overcome some of the barriers to participation and response seen in Time-of-Use studies, although this was not solely due to the payments on offer. 

The project has now been concluded. Following is a list of its key findings and outcomes:

+ The recognition of individual appliance energy consumption from the aggregated consumption data can be significantly improved, especially for the low-power devices, making use of additional audio features as inputs in combination with energy features. 

+ Anomalies (e.g. in energy consumption patterns) can be detected with an improved accuracy using an algorithm that is capable of constructing optimal dynamic models for a training set that minimizes the detection error on the classification set.

+ A novel distributed anomaly detection algorithm is developed that detects anomalous data in the measurements collected by the wireless sensor nodes. It achieves higher detection accuracy with a significant reduction in communication overhead in the network compared to centralised and existing schemes.

+ The synthesis work of Centre for Environmantal Strategy indicates that a positive economic case exists for most of the key types of demand response, however the positive economic case relies upon at least a modest participation (including response) by energy consumers. A challenge will be to ensure the right environment to maximise participation (including response). 

+ Evidence that people's interest in technology may be more important than their interest in environmentalism in determining their likelihood of using technology such as smart meter displays which can aid 'green' behaviours 

+ Evidence that self-determined or internal motivation is related to energy use at work, that is, that psychological factors play a role in how much energy people use in offices 

+ Evidence that both personal mental frameworks and social contexts influence whether people decide to switch off equipment such as computers in shared spaces 

+ Evidence that the physical context can guide people's energy use, specifically if lights are off in a shared space, people are more likely to leave them off

As an outcome of the research we delivered a pilot test bed for the autonomous and self learning Persuasive Energy-conscious Network. This testbed was deployed on 100 desks in CCSR building in University of Surrey. This had impact on many other research projects involving IoT and smart city related research themes. The psychological studies were reported on the behavioural responses of the users to the proposed technologies. A paper in Energy Policy journal was published. Economic analysis investigated the framework models for demand response and energy demand transformations. Costs and benefits and CO2 reductions associated with different forms of demand response were also investigated and published in top quartile leading journals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In future products designed for persuasive energy demand reshaping.
