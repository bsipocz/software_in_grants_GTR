This seems effortless. But from the robotics view, this is almost miraculous because all these tasks are controlled by a single brain, efficiently in parallel. To behave like this human, today's robot would have to use a large million-dollar super-computer or several connected computers using Kilowatts of energy, and the performance would still not comparable to that of a human brain. To build a robot brain by reverse engineering the human or animal brain has been the ultimate goal of many large inter-disciplinary projects in recent years. Today, the most promising technology to physically and structurally emulate the brain is neuromorphic engineering, which uses electronic circuits to mimic neuro-biological architectures. Compared with standard computer-based controllers, neuromorphic controllers are naturally parallel, more compact and more energy efficient. It is widely thought that a neuromorphic brain will be the centre of the next generation of intelligent autonomous robots. 

Many studies in neuromorphic engineering have developed neuromorphic systems to realize specific functional modules of the brain, e.g., hearing, vision, olfaction, cognition, and action learning. The proposed project is targeting another fundamental control function of the human brain -- bipedal (two-legged) walking. Just like humans and animals, a robot must be able to move agilely in order to execute its tasks in the natural environment. But, compared with traditional counterparts, the performance of the neuromorphically controlled legged robots (especially biped robots) is very poor in terms of versatile and agile locomotion. This is mainly because their neuromorphic circuits emulated only the basic function module of the spinal neural network, which could only realize propulsion control. In animals, propulsion control and body posture control are fully integrated, which is fundamental for their agile locomotion in a complex natural environment. Particularly, in humans, to meet the functional requirements of agile bipedal walking, the spinal neural network is heavily modulated by the supraspinal levels. However, it is still not fully understood in biology how the neuronal modules at the spinal level and supraspinal level interact with and modulate each other in the control of human bipedal locomotion. 

Building on the team's track record in biped robotics, neuromorphic circuit design, neuromorphic simulation, and computational neuroscience, the proposed project aims to fill this gap via developing a multi-module and multi-level (i.e., spinal level and supraspinal level) neuromorphic system. In the neuromorphic system in this project, we will implement the functions of three neuronal modules that have been known to play important roles in human locomotion control. By coupling such a neuromorphic system with a purposely designed biped robot using a new method (model-driven concurrent integration), we will be able to explore the unknown interaction/modulation mechanisms between these modules that could lead to agile biped walking.

At the heart of our proposal is the ambition to make a notable step forward in the area of neuromorphic robotics. This project will, for the first time, demonstrate an agile 3D biped robot that has human-like walking patterns and a neuromorphic control mechanism.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project could have academic and societal impacts in the following three key areas. 

1. Shedding new insights on the neuronal control mechanism of human locomotion

The rapidly advancing robotics technologies are providing new tools for testing biological hypotheses or uncovering complex mechanisms in biological systems, which would be difficult or impossible using conventional methods. For example, biologists have long marvelled over the complex social behaviours seen among insects such as bees and ants, where different groups of individuals specialize in different tasks and cooperate perfectly. Now, using swarm robotics and evolutionary robotics, a team of roboticists has given a new explanation of how the specialization and cooperation mechanism may have evolved from simple behaviours. Likewise, there are puzzling questions regarding the control mechanism of humans' bipedal locomotion. It is thought that human walking may be controlled by three neural modules: Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), reflexes, and an internal model. But we don't know how these modules connect/interact with each other to generate versatile and agile biped walking. This is a critical issue in neuroscience and evolutionary biology, because bipedalism is the most fundamental human characteristic that separated the first hominids from the rest of the four-legged apes. The lack of knowledge in detailed circuits of the brain should not prevent us from probing this issue using robotics. One central task of this project is to explore this issue using a multi-module-multi-level neuromorphic system coupled with a sophisticated biped robot. At the end of the project, if the neuromorphic system involving those three neural modules successfully generates agile biped walking in our robot, the interaction/modulation mechanism developed in this project will suggest new testable hypothesis on the interaction mechanism of these modules in human locomotion control. These new insights will be particularly useful for developing smart next-generation neuro-prosthesis. 

2. Developing sophisticated neuromorphic robots using a systematic integration approach.

The neural circuits and the body mechanics of animal locomotor system have evolved together for millions of years. This has led to a fully integrated hierarchical neuro-mechanical system, where the neural circuits are closely coupled with the muscular system at various levels and time scales. Similarly, a future neuromorphic robot may have to have an integrated multi-module-multi-level architecture (like the system in this project), if it is to be capable of sophisticated dynamic motion, such as the agile biped walking in this project. Therefore, system integration will be a central issue in the design of such a robot, which can't be solved by the ad hoc or heuristic integration approaches widely used in the design of today's neuromorphic robots and biomimetic robots. The &amp;quot;model-driven concurrent integration&amp;quot; approach proposed in this project is aiming to systematically solve this critical issue in the emerging area of neuromorphic robotics. This will inspire researchers to develop new systematic integration approaches for efficiently developing sophisticated neuromorphic robots.

3. Inspiring future roboticists and furthering public understanding of advanced robotics

As our project is to explore exciting potentials at the interface of two publicly appealing research areas (biped robots and neuromorphic brain), it has great potential for engaging with young scientists, from school age to early career graduates. 
Our previous work on a record-breaking fast biped robot has attracted media interests (e.g., BBC news). We expect the proposed project to similarly engage public interest given the public's appetite for humanoid/biped robots. Such media coverage would provide an opportunity to reveal to a wide public audience how biologically inspired research is undertaken in robotics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>456453</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P00542X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
