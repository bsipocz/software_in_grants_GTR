events where information is exchanged simply by tapping two devices together. This was as a
result of a Proof of Market study funded by the TSB.
Since then we have generated &amp;pound;190K in revenue, oneTap has been used at over 100 events,
our customers include, UKTI, VentureFest, Founder Forum, European Union, EMAP. In 2015
we have over 100 new events.
Virtually all our customers have indicated there is a market for a much more sophisticated
product which we are describing as an e-paper real-time badge.
This application is for a Proof of Concept grant of &amp;pound;83,835 towards the &amp;pound;139,725 cost of
seeing if is feasible to produce such a badge that could be used at events where there are
100,000 delegates (major exhibitions etc.) The badge would display the delegates name and
organisation on a 10cm by 8cm e-paper screen and could be programmed as the delegate
checks in or pre-programmed to be collected. The badge would act as oneTap but also be able
to connect to compatible mobile devices and sync to the cloud. Many other services are
possible, whilst being re-usable it saves on paper and business cards.
We are a data company, by connecting the dots of how people network we will be able to
offer other services, increasing the value of events to delegates and organisers. We need
minimal infrastructure just our badges and iPads, and we operate with out internet and sync
when it is available
Currently there is no direct alternative to the paper badge with the sophistication we are
proposing, indicating both the opportunity and the challenge of creating a badge that could be
used by the 1 billion people that annually attend networking events around the world. Our
proposed concept could be used in other industries, already been approached by an airline for
luggage tags, building maintainers for security badges, corporates for badging employees,
transferring of money, and healthcare industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83835</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710675</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
