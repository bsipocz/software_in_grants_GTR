Their importance increased in the last decade as the development of the Internet and the mobile networks have had a significant impact on society and various sectors of the economy. This makes it important to develop an appropriate mathematical framework to understand their formation and evolution. In particular, it turns out that an intrinsic characteristic of network evolution is randomness. In fact, large networks involve randomess both in their formation and their evolution. One of the main challenges is to gain insight into how randomness actually gives rise to structure and self-organisation. 

The most common representation of networks is through graphs, where the interaction between individuals is represented by an edge that joins the corresponding nodes. However, in reality interactions are far more complex and, in fact, involve a multitude of individuals. In this project, we will use the mathematical framework of random discrete topological spaces to develop a systematic theory of the evolution of networks whose growth is characterised by multidimensional interactions. Such spaces have also been used in an entirely different context, as part of the development of the theory of quantum gravity. There, they were used as an expression of the granular structure of space-time, in an attempt to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics. 

In our project, we will consider even more general models which allow for dynamically growing structures. The objectives focus on the study of large-scale properties of these objects, based on tools and notions from combinatorics, probability theory and topology. Furthermore, we will explore how these features are linked to dynamics on these spaces, such as random walks and their mixing time. We will also determine the key combinatorial characteristics of these networks and investigate the emergence of global-scale phenomena in them. In particular, we will be aiming to determine those conditions on the growth mechanism which ensure the emergence of power-law degree distributions in the network as well as its small-world properties. Furthermore, we will aim to discover those conditions that characterise the emergence of condensation phenomena in these networks. Such phenomena are also relevant in statistical physics. In this context, they are linked to the emergence of irregularities in the distribution of the degrees and the existence of extremely highly connected nodes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this project is manifold and can be classified as follows.

Knowledge

- Scientific advances 
The proposed research will significantly enhance the theoretical framework of random topological spaces and its applicability to the mathematical modelling of complex networks. This will be achieved through the development of dynamic probabilistic models of random topological spaces, whose formation mechanism is motivated by a fundamental class of models which are known as preferential attachment models. Our intention is to combine the topological notions with the methods of probabilistic combinatorics and probability theory in order to deduce the typical structural properties of these objects. 


- Techniques 
It is exactly the above combination that poses the main technical challenges of this project. The theory of random topological spaces as a natural ramification of the theory of random graphs is still at its infancy. The objectives of the present project demand the development of techniques for handling high dependencies in the evolution of networks which are multidimensional. To be more specific, this requires the asymptotic analysis of more involved Polya urn schemes than those that have been investigated so far. Furthermore, the objectives require the development of systematic techniques for the translation of topological notions into combinatorial objects which are amenable to probabilistic analysis. 



Society and the Economy

The aim of network science is to bring together approaches from different scientific disciplines such as mathematics, physics, biology and computer science, in order to further develop a sound and rigorous theory of complex networks. This term describes the class of self-organising networks that emerge in a variety of settings such as human or human-made networks and biological networks. The theoretical understanding of these mechanisms of growth and formation will further shed a new light to our general understanding of network formation. This project aspires to contribute to this. This is not only a key issue in network science but it is also a fundamental aspect of the emerging area of data science. Having solid theoretical foundations which describe the growth of networks will in turn provide the foundations based on which data science will be able to develop algorithms and techniques for managing enormous sets of data. Thereby, it will help to underpin the infrastructure for various economic sectors that rely on data management. 


People

The proposed project will enhance the combined research capacity of combinatorics, topology and probability, and it provides the platform for the career development of a postdoctoral research associate (PDRA) through a highly intra-disciplinary research theme. In addition to the direct involvement of the PDRA to the execution of the project, we will also pursue their broader professional as well as through relevant teaching activities, conference participation, research seminars and participation into summer schools, scientific visits as well as the organisation of scientific events. All these will ensure a multi-faceted skills development that meets the demand for experts both in industry and academia in areas that deal with the design and analysis of large networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>269286</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P026729/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
