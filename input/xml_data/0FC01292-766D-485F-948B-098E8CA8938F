It was reprinted, anthologized, illustrated throughout the nineteenth century, sometimes praised, sometimes parodied.The only one of the collection to be published as a broadside, it still haunts the popular imagination, as a moving, disturbing, embarrassing vignette of the relation between the educated consciousness and the 'other' it seeks to know.\n In 1798, when 'We are seven' was written, the vast majority of the population were strangers to the educated minority. There was a dearth of social information about them almost unimaginable today. It was not known, even approximately, how many of them there were. They spoke a different dialect, or rather, many different dialects. A few were beginning to make their voices heard in radical publications, but the lives of most were, as Jeremy Bentham put it, 'shrouded in obscurity'. Yet fears of popular radicalism and also of a French invasion were bringing a new kind of urgency to questions about the numbers and opinions of the people, and the near-starvation of a large proportion of the nation was prompting a new concern with the 'state of the poor'.\n This study argues that Wordsworth's 'simple' little poem points sharply and suggestively towards some central issues of its time. Taking it as a starting-point, I begin by exploring how the educated classes attempted to find out about the 'people' amongst whom they lived in the last decades of the eighteenth century. The first two chapters trace the beginnings of 'statistical enquiry' in late eighteenth-century England, and the methodological and practical difficulties it faced; the importance of 'population' in political thinking before Malthus, and the debates about 'numbering the people' that led to the first census of 1801. The third and fourth chapters chart the increasing interest in this period not merely in the condition but in the customs and beliefs of the people, increasingly perceived as other, amongst the educated classes at this time. They examine the writings of the English popular antiquarians, and the Wordsworth circle's fascination with 'vulgar superstition' in these years. They also explore the beginnings of a rather different kind of interest (likewise well known to Wordsworth) in the language and traditions of the people in late eighteenth-century travel writing and topography. \n These completed chapters are based on extensive, original research. They explore a wealth of primary material, much of it undiscussed by historians, much never considered in this way. They offer a much more detailed account than any we currently have of the beginnings of 'statistical' enquiry, of what we now call 'folklore', and of domestic ethnography in England. They consider in some detail the practical and philosophical dilemmas exposed by such enquiry, of which, I shall be suggesting,Wordsworth was sharply aware. \n The two final chapters are at this point more speculative, but I have begun to draft them, and I have a good idea of the kinds of questions they will ask. Chapter Five will explore the questions raised by the poem's vivid, precise portrayal of the challenging strangeness of the girl. It will consider the possibility that Wordsworth is actually articulating features of another mindset, that can be traced in some of the records of the 'people' in this period: one whose conceptions of time, of place, and of the person were significantly different from those of the 'polite'. Chapter Six will focus more directly on the poem which has been a constant point of reference throughout. It will consider the signifying force of repetition and metre in Wordsworth's engagement with these issues, and the ways in which he exploits and re-works the traditional ballad form.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21976</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F006004/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
