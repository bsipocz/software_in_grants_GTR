development materials for improved multi-agency public service delivery</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K00557X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This one year project aims to improve how information is shared between different organisations delivering public services, whether in the public, voluntary or private sectors. It does this by piloting a short multi-agency practitioner development programme, extending the impact of previous research on information sharing and multi-agency working conducted by the project team. This is a collaborative knowledge exchange project, partners being the University of Bradford, Leeds Metropolitan University, the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council and the national exemplar project 'Improving Information Sharing and Management'.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A programme will be devised to supplement, rather than replace, traditional training on information governance and security. It will challenge professionals' thinking around information sharing, mainly by encouraging an understanding of the different contexts within which the agencies work. In particular, research indicates that practitioners will share information more appropriately when they realise that their different organisations need to approach confidentiality in different ways, in order to perform their respective functions correctly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The pilots will take place in Bradford, Manchester and Leicester, the materials being revised in response to evaluation to take place during the training and subsequently. The programme materials will be made freely available at the end of the project.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Anticipated benefits are as follows: (See also the impact logic diagram in the pathways to impact section)
1. Practitioners (whether direct or indirect beneficiaries): practitioners are challenged to think differently about information sharing and will gain access to materials, grounded in academic research, which have not been made available in other information sharing training and guidance platforms; they are given new tools to work with and a supportive multi-professional environment in which to question their current thinking. The legal and policy guidance they might already have seen or used is reframed to give more confidence in sharing information effectively and appropriately.

2. Academic partners: the project will offer a direct route to tangible impact from previous research. This will then also provide higher visibility for the HEIs and their research endeavours. The project offers a modest opportunity for commercialisation through the marketing of continuing professional development expertise. Individual academics working on the project will enjoy the satisfaction of seeing their research find a realisation in the 'real world' and will benefit in terms of their career achievements. They will also learn from the knowledge exchange activity and this will contribute to academic knowledge.

3. Service delivery organisations (whether direct or indirect beneficiaries): the information sharing between professionals in different organisations should improve as a result of the project, becoming both more appropriate and more effective, resulting in improved public service delivery. There will then be a greater potential for realignment of services bringing service efficiencies and further service quality improvements. Individuals working on the project from service delivery partners will benefit from a close working relationship with academics, experiencing the practical benefits from original research and having the opportunity to embed some of the learning from the project in their own organisations and practices.

4. Troubled Families Programme and other multi-agency initiatives: Benefits will be direct in the case of the localities benefitting from the pilot trainings. If the project can contribute to improvements in information sharing practice, making the materials freely available , this will indirectly benefit the whole Troubled Families programme and the other initiatives supported by the Improving Information Sharing and Management Exemplar. 

5. Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) and HM Treasury (HMT): as sponsor department for the Troubled Families programme and for the exemplar project, CLG will indirectly benefit from the project if it contributes to the success of programmes such as Troubled Families. Similarly, HMT will indirectly benefit as the TF programme seeks to make efficiencies, partly as a result of being able to realign services through improved information sharing.

6. ESRC: The research council will benefit indirectly from the project's success as there will be evidence of a clear route from ESRC funding of original research through ESRC funding of knowledge exchange to real impact on public services, projecting through the impact logic to the improvement of the nation's health and well-being.

7. The general public as service users: In some ways, the most important group of beneficiaries are members of the public who rely on public services to enable them to live with, generally, high levels of health and well-being. With public finances even more stretched, it is important that innovations are made to service delivery and one potential solution is to realign services to both improve quality and increase efficiency through services working better together. This depends on effective and appropriate sharing of personal and sensitive information, however, and the proposed project can support this, indirectly benefitting members of the public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29291</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Centre of Excellence for Information Sharing</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>National information sharing collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>0495263F-2E57-4172-AC8B-42F3EE0AE9B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None to date other than the ESRC seminar series grant that resulted from this collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cb86adde1d9.52458667-5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Each of the other partners has made their own distinct contribution.

There continues to be a need for face-to-face, multi-agency, practitioner development workshops aimed at improving the sharing of information in public services. These would target for example health workers, social workers, teachers, police officers, housing officers, employment officers, support workers. 2. The project has developed a workshop programme to meet this need. 3. The two main elements of the workshops, a) formal taught input, based on social science research findings and b) multi-agency scenario-based group tasks, are both important. While participants generally found the content useful, many reporting that it gave them new ways of thinking about information sharing, what was equally important was to work in a 'safe' way with colleagues from other services, hearing their stories and understanding why they need to work differently from each other when sharing information, particularly with respect to confidentiality and seeking consent to share. 4. The separation of two to four weeks between the two workshop days was important for consolidation of learning and reflection. 5. There were some variations in participant response across the three workshops conducted in Bradford (20 participants), Greater Manchester (30 participants) and Leicestershire (22 participants). More may be learned about exactly what variables are at play from the on-going evaluation activity that will be reported on in the project impact report (2015). 6. It was reported by employer organisations that if the workshops were to be scaled up to be offered to all relevant staff, two full days was too long for practitioners to be away from the front line for what is seen as 'training'. As a result of this finding, an alternative, blended learning, format was developed which reduces the face to face element to two half days (still separated by two to four weeks). This was tried in Blaby District within the project lifetime and, from the investigators' perspective and the feedback received, was as successful as (although noticeably different from) the full two day version in terms of encouraging new ways of thinking and doing around information sharing. 7. A second variation to the format was tried as a result of an invitation from the public service network organisation iNetwork. This not only attempted to create an understanding of the differences across professional and service divides but also across the divide between practitioners and information governance managers. From the investigators' perspective, this was less successful but there is the potential to further research this possibility as it could potentially be extremely fruitful.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The investigators have plans for further, related, research. Through the project, the new government-funded Centre of Excellence for Information Sharing has brought the project investigators together with colleagues in Newcastle University, Manchester Metropolitan University, Loughborough University and the University of East Anglia, to help shape a new research agenda for improving information sharing in public services. This group of researchers has now been awarded an ESRC seminar series grant in order to move this work on. A book chapter using ideas from this project has been published in a book targeting professionals in children's services so this material is now available to practitioners.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F0E01D28-17F7-4273-85F5-3D27DC8FFDBD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545caee8e92728.42981254</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB5C7DC5-2721-4AED-A8C8-688803E759F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Developing Multi-professional Teamwork in Integrated Children's Services</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2356838a29651450058153d16aedb688"><gtr:id>2356838a29651450058153d16aedb688</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richardson, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780335263967</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56df182f622663.18748713</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8B830394-BF9D-465B-A74B-669A30D89457</gtr:id><gtr:title>SUPPORTING PUBLIC SERVICES TO IMPROVE THE SHARING OF SERVICE USER INFORMATION</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2819995078311768b2f7d8736c64e773"><gtr:id>2819995078311768b2f7d8736c64e773</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nicola Underdown (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_733008419213c83972</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K00557X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
