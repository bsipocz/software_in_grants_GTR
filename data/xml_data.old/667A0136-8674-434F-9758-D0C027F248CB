It dissolves barriers between cultures - crucial in a world that is ever more globalised, but also marked by misunderstanding between cultures. And producing translated poetry is a modest but important part of the cultural economy. Researching how experts translate poetry gives understanding of how these benefits come about, which can in turn improve practice. Existing research focuses on poetry translating by solo translators, who can read an original 'source-language' poem and convert it directly into a 'target-language' version. Increasingly, however, poetry is also being translated in collaborative workshops - but no systematic research has been done into how these operate. Hence our project aims to find this out by analysing the working processes and outputs of poet-advisor-poet trios (the most representative workshop format). Here, poems are translated by three people working face-to-face: the poet who wrote the source poem, a target-language poet (who does not know the source language), and a language advisor (who knows both languages).

We will set up two 4-day expert workshops, where 3 poets from the Netherlands and 3 poets from the UK, helped by 3 language advisors, will work in 3 simultaneous trios to translate each other's poems. Each workshop - one at Poetry International Rotterdam (the Netherlands' biggest poetry festival), and one at Newcastle University - will end with a public reading of poems and draft translations, and talks by participants. All poets are eminent, widely-published poets (most with translating experience), and all language advisors are experienced solo poetry translators. We will video all working discussions and written translation drafts, and hold videoed interviews with participants after each workshop.

These video recordings, once securely stored and transcribed, will form our raw research data. We will use them to draw a rich, multidimensional picture of how expert poet-advisor-poet trios work: what poems they choose to translate, the translation challenges they meet and how they solve them, interpersonal relations and talk patterns within working trios, what principles poets and advisors try to follow, and what motivates their work. We will also examine how trios tackle key poetry-translating issues, such as the tension between conveying a source poem's exact content and making the translation into a poem in its own right, and how far translators are willing to make creative changes to source-poem meaning. 

Finding this out will increase knowledge of collaborative poetry translation, but also of poetry translation and experts' translation processes in general. We will communicate this to academic audiences via a monograph, academic journal articles and conference papers. The project will also benefit non-academic users: translations from the workshops will bring Dutch and UK poetry to new audiences; and project findings will generate guidelines for good practice, and will inspire and inform future poet-advisor-poet ventures. To enable this, poem translations and project findings will reach poets, translators and poetry audiences via reading events, poetry journals and artwork, websites, social media and professional translation associations. 

This interdisciplinary project is led by a translation-studies scholar (Francis Jones, Newcastle University) and two poetry-writing scholars (W.N. Herbert and Fiona Sampson, Newcastle and Roehampton University), all specialised in poetry translating as translators and researchers, helped by two Research Associates. We will work closely with two project partners (Dutch Foundation for Literature and Poetry International Rotterdam), and two university research and public-outreach centres (Newcastle Centre for the Literary Arts and Roehampton Poetry Centre).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Poetry is a significant source of individual well-being, and is often a central element in how people define their culture and heritage; poetry publishing and performance also form an important sector of the cultural economy. Translating poetry extends these benefits across language cultures, and is a crucial pathway to inter-cultural understanding. With our project's poet-advisor-poet workshops, the expertise of those taking part (who are all eminent poets or experienced poetry translators) will almost certainly result in high-quality translations. Hence our project's first aim is to deliver these inter-cultural benefits directly, by bringing our project's poems and their translations to poetry audiences. 

Moreover, this inter-cultural dimension lies at our project's heart, since its poet-advisor-poet translating method involves poets from different language cultures working with an inter-language and inter-cultural mediator (the language advisor). This gives the poet-advisor-poet translating method a special potential, which our research findings will define clearly. Hence our project's other aims are to communicate these findings, and guidelines on good practice arising from them, to poets and translators - and, no less importantly, to communicate them to organisations that promote and develop poetry and its translation. This will empower more poet-advisor-poet trios to deliver the benefits of poetry translation to more audiences, giving our project a much wider ultimate effect on poetry-translating and poetry-using communities worldwide.

Specific beneficiaries of our project's poems and translations, and of its findings and guidelines, are:

[1] Poetry audiences worldwide who know English or Dutch. They will hear and read poems and their translations from the project, delivered via live and web-streamed readings, and via paper and on-line poetry journals. This will enable them to enjoy the benefits of translated poetry mentioned above - and also to experience poetry translated from their own language into another. 

[2] Poets who know English or Dutch (including the large community of world poets with English or Dutch as a second language). As part of the poetry audiences just mentioned, they too will hear and read poems and translations from the project. This will expand their cultural horizons by letting them experience new translated poetry, and - in some cases - inspire their own poetic work. They will also hear and read project reports and guidelines about poet-advisor-poet translating, which will accompany translation readings and translation journal features, and which will be posted on websites and via social media; and we will train some poets in poet-advisor-poet translating. This will inspire more poets to undertake poet-advisor-poet ventures themselves.

[3] Translators, including existing translators of poetry. Like poets, they will hear and read project reports and guidelines about poet-advisor-poet translating, and some will be trained in poet-advisor-poet translating. Our aim will be to help bring about a paradigm shift, from viewing poetry translation just as a specialist one-person venture (for the few who can translate a source poem directly into a convincing target-language poem), to viewing it also as a team effort where a translator works with poets. This will inspire more translators to join poet-advisor-poet ventures themselves.

[4] Organisations which promote poetry and its translation. Project staff will report project findings and guidelines to them, thus influencing the translation projects that they support and encouraging them to sponsor poet-advisor-poet ventures (or more such ventures). These organisations, plus translators' professional bodies, will also publicise project translations, reports and guidelines via their websites, social media and professional journals, ensuring that this project impacts on a worldwide community of poetry-users, poets and translators.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>332145</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P004628/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DE53E60A-FE46-433C-BA16-151F707B335F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Creative Writing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E66DC80-F20F-4AC2-915A-AF46F5C6ED14</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interpreting &amp; Translation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
