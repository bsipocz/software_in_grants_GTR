The event was extremely successful and engaged a live audience of 300 extra-CERN Geneva locals, 10,000 international online viewers (5,000 from UK) and was covered by international media outlets. We now intend to expand the LHComedy vehicle in the UK through the creation of a live, interactive comedy show, LHComedy: UK, aimed at exposing GCSE student/teacher/parent and general public adult audiences to the scientific method and cutting edge research. 

The show has several key aims:

1) Introduce the scientific methodology 

Many forms of scientific outreach concentrate on explaining aspects of high level science, but few explain the scientific process itself. UK Government research shows that approximately a third of the general public say they do not understand the scientific methodology of hypothesis testing, analysis and peer review [http://tinyurl.com/o6r4dvj]. This is a significant barrier preventing the general public from engaging with science. In addition, the UK Key Stage 3 (GCSE) exam board physics specifications now include a principle focus on teaching students &amp;quot;how science works&amp;quot; [http://tinyurl.com/ky8mmd4]. These specifications can be difficult and tedious to teach using traditional methods and require a more interactive approach. We intend to introduce audiences to the scientific methodology and engage them with activities that are exciting and amusing, allowing them to &amp;quot;learn by doing&amp;quot; and guide the outcome of each show. Understanding the scientific method is essential if GCSE students are going to continue to persevere with physics.

2) Allow CERN affiliated scientists (and professional science communicators) to interact directly with audiences

The popularity and impact of communicators like Brian Cox, Dara O'Brien and shows such as The Infinite Monkey Cage indicate that getting large demographics to engage with science means making the people presenting the scientific information sociable, approachable and relatable. Combining science and comedy, and allowing active CERN affiliated scientific researchers and professional scientific communicators to interact directly with audiences, not only creates excitement and offers significant gravitas to disseminated material, but also counteracts the negative stereotypes of physicists e.g. by presenting female physics role models. We can also challenge the &amp;quot;Big Bang Theory&amp;quot; stereotype of physicists as anti-social. Combined with making science more relevant, fun and appealing, this helps to draw the next generation to career paths in scientific research (at the pivotal GCSE stage). Experiential learning is also particularly effective for engaging students in under-performing schools.

In addition, the project challenges CERN affiliated researchers to explain their work and lifestyle in an engaging and entertaining manner. This improves their communication skills and provides an element of training.

3) Legacy and sustainability

The LHComedy project has created an on-going two way discussion between active CERN scientists and professional scientific communicators/comedians. We aim to continue this partnership so that novel ways of disseminating scientific information can be suggested and discussed by both sides. 

The structure of the proposed new show (see following sections) can also be repurposed to explain the scientific method with reference to advances in any other science. We hope to produce a show that inspires spin off performances. 

4) Impact assessment

Several vehicles have attempted to use comedy to engage audiences with high-level science. However, there is little evidence as to its efficacy. We will collect thorough online and live audience feedback to help fill the gaps in the existing literature.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Raising potential audience awareness

In order to engage as many people as possible, LHComedy: UK must be highly visible. Awareness will be raised in several ways:

1) Schools will be contacted directly to invite them to shows. 

We will target schools directly to efficiently meet the project objectives. First preference will be given to schools from multi-deprived areas and with significant student populations that are under-represented in STEM fields e.g. all girls schools. Several schools with high free school meals %s have all ready been identified and have expressed an interest in hosting show performances. 

2) A dedicated social media campaign will be undertaken.

In the run up to (and following) the prototype events, a dedicated social media manager (Dr Ben Still) will maintain a strong social media presence for the project. The project personnel are, or have strong links with, individuals with a strong online presence e.g. Brian Cox, Robin Ince etc

- Project personnel 

Several project personnel (and their related activities) have large, established follower bases on Twitter, Facebook etc e.g. Helen Arney, Lieven Scheire, Festival of the Spoken Nerd.

- Project associated organisations and contacts 
 
CERN/LHC are firm supporters of LHComedy and command millions of followers worldwide. They are likely to support any advertising.

3) Traditional media outlets will be contacted

Many high profile worldwide media outlets covered the initial LHComedy: CERN after Dark show and several of these were UK based e.g. The Guardian and The Independent. If the LHComedy project expands into the UK, it is highly likely that they would be interested in covering the event again.

4) Prototype events will initially be held at a high impact to maximise interest. 

The Royal Institution, Science Museum and Royal Society are all interested in hosting prototype events.


Raising awareness within the science communication community

We would also like to raise awareness of what we are attempting to achieve within the science communication community.

In writing and developing the show we will encourage and nurture discussion between high level scientists and professional 
performers. Over a period of several months we will host science master classes and performance workshops to create and develop ideas for the show (with a Google+ connection available to limit travel required). Scientists will present a master class of basic physics and high level research work to affiliated professional performers in the science master classes. In return the professionals will lead workshops developing the scientists public engagement skills and produce engaging content for LHComedy: UK. These master classes provide an element of performance training for the amateur scientific performers and raise the scientific literacy of the professionals. The conversation will continue outside of these sessions as each party processes the skills and knowledge. For instance, it will feed directly into the delivery of a session at the BIG Event 2015 by Suzie Sheehy.

This format efficiently facilitates knowledge transfer, creates a mutual respect for each profession's creative practice and seeds further collaboration. The success of the project can be evaluated by the continued interaction and collaboration between the scientists and professional performers involved.

We strongly intend for these regular workshops/master classes to continue, as an science communication industry standard, long after the current project proposal period has expired. Further funding or sponsorship may be sought for this from additional sources after they are established. These workshops/master classes have the potential to form the basis for a future informal science communication platform and could be connected with other networks such as the British Science Association or British Interactive Group.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Stephen Fry very kindly agreed to lend his voice skills to the voice-overs we use to open the show (off stage &amp;quot;voice of God&amp;quot;) and link individual show sections (recap of previous section and prepping the audience for the new section)</gtr:description><gtr:id>B2F7D45D-DAFF-4396-B437-5B4CC55D7AE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The voiceovers provided by Stephen Fry are first rate and also contain some very funny moments.

The school intends to hold follow up performances on the present show or any follow up shows and the science teacher hosting the evening provided the following testimonial:

&amp;quot;The 'Ministry of Sense' presentation was nothing short of a triumph. It formed the climax of our annual school Christmas science lectures and was watched by over 150 people from ages of 11 upwards. The delivery was impeccable, it is obviously well rehearsed and flowed seamlessly. It is always a pleasure to see the audience engaged with concepts that would otherwise be inaccessible. Sam achieved this through the use of real life contexts, excellent props and a huge dose of good humour! The audience were 'along for the journey', hooked by his storytelling and cognitive conflicts - arousing much curiosity and intrigue. My colleagues in the Science department were very complimentary. Previously Physics 'sceptics', they were certainly won over by his engaging manner and explanation of (often challenging) concepts in Physics. I knew the inevitable feedback would be excellent based on the audiences reaction at the end of the lecture. This was a scaled down lecture with only Sam and his assistant operating the laptop. I eagerly anticipate seeing the full blown presentation at a later date.

I wish to have the Ministry of Sense back again soon - possibly with a large group of Year 6 pupils from out local feeder primaries. I believe Sam has the ability to take particle physics make sense to even a ten year old, as good were his analogies and explanations. Projects like this a few and far between and I hope he continues for many years (forming a working partnership with us in the process). &amp;quot;

The show was well received however, feedback indicated that some script tweaks could be made to:

 - order the script in a more logical manner

An unexpected technical issue also occurred with one of the interactive activities, which slowed the show down. 

Following this show, the show script was re-arranged and streamlined and additional technical back-ups were implemented. This large scale show, and the subsequent feedback, really helped us to finesse the show content and flow.

Show feedback from the show was excellent in terms of entertainment, intended follow up.

One thing that we realised is that there is potential (and encouragement) to produce a more adult show for this demographic. The show is currently &amp;quot;school safe&amp;quot; and a relaxed script would be more appropriate for entirely adult audiences. The material for such a performance exists but has not been used yet.

This question was largely covered in the previous section.

Finding 1) Comedy and interactivity are excellent tools to teach high level science and the steps of the scientific method to a wide range of demographics:

- The MoS show has successfully engaged a live audience of &amp;gt; 2,500 people, including several large school, adult and mixed age (family) audiences (see attached feedback analysis spreadsheet)

- Teachers have commented on how the show covers difficult/boring to teach areas of the curriculum including &amp;quot;How science works&amp;quot; and have even been inspired to create bespoke lesson plans following the visit of the show.

2) The show has inspired the creation of follow up teaching material to ensure a lasting legacy and on-going engagement: 

The show feedback has been excellent across all performance indicators (and testimonials), however, the show is slightly better at entertaining and sparking interest than facilitating continuing and follow up engagement and allowing audiences engaged to speak with confidence about the subjects covered.

To address this point, the team partnered with Dr Ben Still, a physics teacher and communicator. He has produced 2 prep lectures (see attached files) on the scientific method and particle physics that will be sent to schools ~ 1 month before the show visits. These lessons can be delivered to the children who (will) attend the show as close to the show date as possible. 

The team also intends to produce a show pamphlet/leaflet briefly covering the concepts contained in the show and providing links for further reading, links to MoS activities and support materials etc. 

3) The show tour was slightly under-budgeted in terms of monetary cost and delivery timescales:

The experience of taking a show from the drawing board to full fruition will help the team better price/schedule shows and related activities in the future. 

4) It is possible to change the perceptions of science and scientists in the eyes of any demographic by using comedy and relevant analogies/references:

Teachers have reported students requesting additional shows, sharing social media messages regarding shows etc. High profile additional engagement opportunities have already been offered and accepted.

5) The show has a legacy and is becoming increasingly sustainable

The show has recently secured high profile future engagements at the Cheltenham Science Festival 2017, The National Space Centre and The Glasgow Science Museum Lates (as well as new schools). These future engagements were secured following contact from organisers that has either seen the show or had the show recommended to them via word of mouth. More show funding must be secured if the show is to remain free to perform.

Follow up shows covering other areas of science have also been requested and are being discussed (see feedback spreadsheet).

On-going relationships have between created between the MoS team and high profile science comedians/communicators Helen Arney and Jonny Berliner, as well as actor and TV star Stephen Fry. There on-going support and advice will help to shape the future of the show. 

We would like to discuss the possibility of continuing to deliver the show as an official STFC outreach project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6092B3BB-6823-4858-A29C-BD855D3CB9BD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddadf15b7016.67490691</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A dropbox folder of files supporting this feedback can be found here:

1) Comedy and interactivity are excellent tools to teach high level science and the steps of the scientific method to a wide range of demographics:

- The MoS show has successfully engaged a live audience of &amp;gt; 2,500 people, including several large school, adult and mixed age (family) audiences.

- The show has successfully engaged significant numbers of under-achieving students (who we were warned were from troublesome backgrounds - Preston Manor High School, Dinnington High School etc) by making science and the scientific method amusing and relatable. 

- The show has successfully engaged large audiences from demographics typically under-represented in science e.g. Asian and black students (Preston Manor and City of London Academy) and young women (Gateway's Girls high schools and large mixed gender groups). 

- The show feedback from every audience demographic has been excellent (see attached feedback spreadsheet) in all respects. 

- Teachers have commented on how the show covers difficult/boring to teach areas of the curriculum including &amp;quot;How science works&amp;quot; and have even been inspired to create bespoke lesson plans following the visit of the show.

2) The show should be supported by prepping and follow up teaching material to ensure a lasting legacy and on-going engagement: 

The show feedback has been excellent across all performance indicators (and testimonials), however, the show is slightly better at entertaining and sparking interest than facilitating continuing and follow up engagement and allowing audiences engaged to speak with confidence about the subjects covered.

3) The show tour was slightly under-budgeted in terms of monetary cost and delivery timescales:

Securing appropriate engagement opportunities to test initial script versions took a significant amount of time. In addition, the show script, slides and props had to be iteratively updated, edited and changed from their initial versions as show feedback was collected. It took several revisions and a significant amount of time for the team to be happy with the content, tone and style of the show materials. 

This requirement for additional testing, improvement and time incurred additional costs that strained the budget to it's limits and meant that some supplementary deliverables could not be realised:

- Show webcasts + follow up internet uploads - cost and limitations of venues
- Create a maintained social media presence and appoint a full time social media manager
- Citizen science spin-off project - although discussions are on-going regarding this aspect of the initial grant submission. 

The team would still like to realise these supplementary deliverables when additional show funding is secured.

4) It is possible to change the perceptions of science and scientists in the eyes of any demographic by using comedy and relevant analogies/references:

The show presents a team of scientists of different genders, ages and specialisms and allowed has allowed high level scientists to interact directly with large audiences and really challenge troublesome stereotypes held by those audiences.

Audiences have reported significant changes in attitude toward science and scientists (especially centred around the typical boring, nerdy, socially awkward stereotypes). These changes of attitude were particularly pleasing in under-achieving schools. Teachers have reported students requesting additional shows, sharing social media messages regarding shows etc.

The show has also allowed the MoS team to develop, improve, advertise and maintain a show from scratch. This was a daunting and difficult proposition. However, the skills acquired and situations experienced by the team will make the development of follow-up.spin-off shows much easier. 

5) The show has a legacy and is becoming increasingly sustainable

The show has recently secured high profile future engagements at the Cheltenham Science Festival 2017, The National Space Centre and The Glasgow Science Museum Lates (as well as new schools).

Many audience members say that the interactivity of the show is it's greatest strength.

The local WiFi server allows local access to the websites needed for the show (where the page are located). This was developed as a way to get around problems encountered during show testing:

1) Many schools only allow access to certain sites. We always have access to our show games regardless of the school's internet policy. 
2) Large audience put a strain on local WiFi resources. With the local hub, we have a dedicated connection to our games regardless of audience size.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2ec3d089f63.41136399</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Development of a suite of interactive show games to illustrate different aspects of the scientific method</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ministryofsense.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/N001974/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
