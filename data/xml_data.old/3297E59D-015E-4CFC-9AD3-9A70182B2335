For instance, the inscription 'Tony Blair' refers to the current British Prime Minister, although this inscription--consisting of nine ink marks on paper--in no way depends on or resembles the person Tony Blair. In themselves, these ink marks are completely 'dead'; they are ultimately nothing but a complicated arrangement of particles. Nevertheless these ink marks manage to 'reach out' beyond themselves and refer to the Prime Minister. What endows ink marks on paper with this power to refer to objects with which they have no intrinsic connection? In virtue of what does the relation of reference obtain? \n\nThe logician and philosopher Frege (1848-1925) proposes that the key to explaining reference is his 'context principle,' according to which a word has meaning only in the context of a complete sentence. This suggests that the power of a word to refer should be explained not in isolation but in terms of its contribution to the meaningfulness of a complete sentence. My project is to develop and defend this proposal and to investigate some applications of the resulting view of reference. \n\nAmong complete sentences, Frege is particularly interested in identities such as 'a = b'. If we can explain how such sentences come to be meaningful, Frege claims, then this can be used to explain how the names 'a' and 'b' come to refer. For to refer to an object is just to be able to identify this object when it is presented in different ways and to be able to distinguish it from other objects. For instance, to refer to the pen in front of me is just to be able to track it over time and to distinguish it from other items on my desk. \n\nIf Frege is right about this, then our task is to explain how an identity 'a = b' comes to be meaningful. And crucially, this must be done without presupposing an ability to explain how the names 'a' and 'b' come to refer: for the whole idea of the context principle was to begin with sentences rather than names. I believe such an explanation is possible. Suppose I am looking at a large rock, two parts of which stick out of the ground. Suppose I use 'a' and 'b' to mean respectively this rock and that rock (pointing at the two protruding parts). I am then able to assign a meaning to the sentence 'a = b', namely that this sentence is true just in case the two parts I am looking at are connected through a stretch of solid stuff which ensures that they hang together as one thing. And crucially, this explanation does not presuppose an ability to explain reference. All it presupposes is an ability to explain the causal interaction with parts of rocks that takes place in perception and people's grasp of what it is for one part to be connected with another. \n\nI believe analogous explanations can be given more generally, even when the objects in question are non-spatiotemporal. For instance, I refer to a direction (say North) by means of a line pointing in that direction; two such lines determining the same direction just in case they are parallel. I refer to some a set by indicating its elements; two such indications determining the same set just in case they indicate precisely the same elements. \n\nAn important application of my Fregean view of reference is to some problems and paradoxes in the philosophy of mathematics. A central problem in set theory is the question what sets there are. My hypothesis is that, when reference is understood in the substantive and non-circular way outlined above, there are precisely such sets as can be referred to. I show that this hypothesis gives rise to a new and elegant way of motivating and explaining the standard theory of sets. I also argue that the paradoxes that have plagued set theory arise because we have failed to specify in a non-circular way what sets we are referring to.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25421</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EB175F18-E1A5-49EA-971A-938A43069BE0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bad company tamed</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Synthese</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/819e58210d0200a157c7a30a406db358"><gtr:id>819e58210d0200a157c7a30a406db358</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Linnebo ?</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfdefde9dd53cc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3DF6EC6A-A8CC-4016-AFAE-D33ABAAAEE94</gtr:id><gtr:title>THE POTENTIAL HIERARCHY OF SETS</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Review of Symbolic Logic</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/25d1f1cf2a49e33d49e8236043b2b0a3"><gtr:id>25d1f1cf2a49e33d49e8236043b2b0a3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LINNEBO ?</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d013013b661fa7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E003753/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6E6227B6-029E-4DD5-8ADF-6D46BE6CEE4D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language &amp; Philosophical Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C6428B5-4A75-42D5-9D5B-5DF34F513B7E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science &amp; Maths, &amp; Math Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
