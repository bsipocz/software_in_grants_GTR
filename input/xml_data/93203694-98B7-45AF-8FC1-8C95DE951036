Reception is understood here as the result of a complex set of processes, involving both immediate and culturally mediated aspects of experience. This project sets out to investigate how these different processes are interrelated, analysing how the unconscious embodiment of sound; culturally constrained uses of gesture; aesthetic appreciation; and the socio-musical interactions displayed in performance all contribute to the construction of meaning in music. This project, thus, aims to develop a model for the study of music performance which focuses on its reception by both musicians and listeners, setting a framework for music research in which the boundaries between stage and audience become blurred.\nThe research methodology is based on analysis of audiovisual recordings of performances and interviews with both musicians and listeners, and draws on and combines a number of perspectives and disciplines, including ethnography, study of behaviour and gesture in performance, applied semiotics, and analysis of embodied cognition in music. Questions to be addressed include:\n- How does the way people express their experience of music shed light on processes of embodiment of sound, and how does the latter contribute to the construction of meaning? \n- How does the unconscious embodiment of music relate to cultural constraints on physical behaviour and how are these manifested in performance?\n- What makes a good performance, according to both listeners and musicians? How do musicians and listeners articulate their aesthetic expectations and how do they comment on music performance? \n- How are musicians' and audiences' social roles and relationships displayed through performance? How do artists and listeners articulate the dynamics they engage in and experience in performance? How do these dynamics affect the reception of music?\nIn answering these questions, the research will focus on North Indian classical music: this tradition is in fact an ideal object for this study due to its rich metaphorical discourse, a long history of reflection on aesthetic issues, and a well-structured code of behaviour in performance reflecting clear hierarchies and social roles, both on stage and among the audience. In particular, the analysis will be carried out on a comparative basis, working on two regions - the Indian States of West Bengal and Maharashtra - which boast a rich and fervent art music culture, but are historically, politically and culturally very different. Such a comparative approach will allow me to ascertain whether and in what ways the processes implicated in the reception of music performance relate to cultural background and context. \nIn summary, this project proposes a significant advance in the study of music performance, contributing a new perspective to the understanding of the processes underlying its reception. It will be of interest to South Asian music scholarship, and also - due to the interdisciplinary nature of the methodology proposed - to musicology, music psychology, semiotics, and research on embodied cognition.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>167951</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Organisation of a public music performance featuring Indian khyal singer Veena Sahasrabuddhe and accompanists Vishwanath and Seema Shirodkar (respectively on tabla and harmonium).

By looking at North Indian classical music, we developed a model for the study of music performance which focuses on its reception by both musicians and listeners, blurring the boundaries between stage and audience.
 
The project's methodology was based on analysis of audiovisual recordings of performances and interviews with both musicians and listeners, and drew on a number of perspectives and disciplines, including ethnography, study of gesture in performance, applied semiotics, and analysis of embodied cognition in music.
 
The project shed light on different aspects that combine in making the experience of performance meaningful, achieving a deeper understanding of how:
 
- Unconscious processes of embodiment of sound can contribute to the construction of meaning people attribute to music;
 
- The aesthetic appreciation of performance is highly subjective and determined by a number of factors variously influenced by social relationships and embodiment;
 
- Performers and listeners engage, display, and articulate social roles and relationships in performance and how these affect the reception of music.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By developing new research into the study of performance in a variety of contexts and by developing new engagement projects with the wider public.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D56BFD2B-A998-4CCA-90F9-E2CE70E35894</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9228743863.5050727761a5f0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.dur.ac.uk/music/research/projects/northindianmusic/ahrc2/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The collection archived at the BLSA included: the recordings of 12 North Indian Classical music concerts filmed with multiple camera shots (for a total of approximately 60 hours of footage) and the video recordings of about 40 interviews with Indian classical musicians.

The app allows users to explore two performances of khyal (from 2010 and 2016) and learn about its form, style, and technique. Initially planned as an integral part of the &amp;quot;Khyal: Music and Imagination&amp;quot; project exhibition, the app is freely available for download from the App Store.
Moving their fingers over four mixers sliders, or on the video window itself, users are able to hear the different sound elements in their preferred mix (voice, tabla, harmonium, and tanpura). This is a unique chance to hear the singing voice alone, for instance, or to experience the difference made by the tabla, harmonium or tanpura, when added in. Key points in each performance are marked as selectable &amp;quot;clips&amp;quot;: selecting a clip takes the user to a particular point in the performance and opens up information abut the techniques the musicians are using at that specific moment. Taken as a whole, the app offers an overview of the musical form: it is designed as a flexible educational tool for those getting to know khyal, as well as for the enjoyment of Indian music lovers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8A4621C0-66C1-47A1-8AE9-5D2E22784E1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The app has only recently being launched.
