Despite a large amount of research on this topic, we still do not understand the most fundamental aspect of face processing: how can we identify the people we see? This is a key problem in human perception, but it also has practical implications in forensic and security settings. This project has its roots in a simple observation: pictures of the same face can look very different indeed. In the standard approach to face recognition, this commonplace fact is treated as an inconvenience. Differences between pictures of the same person are regarded as 'noise', and either ignored or eliminated by systematically controlling the images used for research. This research programme takes exactly the converse approach. Instead of trying to control away this variability, it will be studied explicitly. Under this approach, the problem of face recognition is not how to 'tell people apart', but instead how to 'tell people together' - how to bring together superficially different images into a coherent representation. Early work suggests that a very important component of familiar face recognition is the ability to generalize over superficial image differences - differences which tend to fool unfamiliar viewers, as well as automatic computer-based systems. The current failure to address this variability may account for the slow progress in face identification - progress which has fallen behind the understanding of other aspects of face processing such as social perception. This research comprises three components. First, a systematic examination will be conducted of the physical differences between images of the same person. Applying statistical techniques to graphical data, the aim is to specify what aspects of face images vary commonly, and what aspects vary idiosyncratically to that person. Second, a series of behavioural experiments will examine the nature of our representations of familiar faces - the hypothesis is that this representation needs to incorporate variability. Third, a series of studies will address practical face recognition by human observers (e.g. for security purposes). Computer-based approaches will also be examined in this strand - as these systems remain very poor, despite the claims of vendors. This novel approach to face identification has the potential to make a significant contribution to an area which has progressed rather slowly in recent years.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research planned here has direct relevance across a wide range of settings. Photo ID has become very common in the UK, in situations raging from the security-critical (e.g. proving one's identity at an airport) to the more prosaic (e.g. proving one's age in order to buy alcohol). Furthermore, the police and judicial system rely extensively on personal identification, for example when viewing crime-scene CCTV. Despite this reliance, it is simply an unreliably procedure: neither computers nor humans are good at matching unfamiliar people to their photos. 

Part of the planned work directly addresses how to improve the use of photo-ID. As a regular speaker to police agencies, and as a teacher at the Scottish Police Training College, I will use these opportunities to describe the latest research. These forums are key, because one has direct access to people operational in the field. Existing contacts with the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and its Scottish counterpart will also be used to engage relevant professionals in the results of this work. The commissioners are particularly concerned with ID at the present, because matters of disputed identification are at the heart of several high profile legal cases. For this reason, both agencies have requested reports from my lab in the past. 

My research group is involved in an on-going collaboration involving the University of New South Wales, and the Australian passport authority, and this is focused on the limits of facial identification (as well as potential improvements). This collaboration was originally funded by ESRC and the Australian Research Council, and has been very successful in passing research results to the Australian authorities. So far, the UK Border Agency has been less enthusiastic to engage with this research. However, in this project I undertake to develop contacts with UKBA, through the office of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Home Office. 

A further impact opportunity arises through the interest of engineers in the problem of face recognition. Current automated systems (for example at airports) work only very poorly. The theory driving this proposal is that the typical engineering approach is unlikely to produce robust levels of recognition, and that advances in understanding human perceptual processes can improve automated systems. For this reason, I have requested support to disseminate research on human perceptual face processing to engineering audiences (in both private and public sectors). 

Throughout the period, I will continue to engage a broader audience with this research. I am regularly asked to speak at public engagement events, and to the media, and so there will be many opportunities to do this.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>107750</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A major finding from this project was the fact that police and passport officers, as a group, are no better than the general population at matching unfamiliar faces. However, these professional groups are very diverse, with some officers performing extremely well, and others poorly - a pattern that is replicated in the normal population. This means that the extensive training received by professional groups is not highly effective. Instead, a more efficient strategy for improving the performance of security agencies would be to select personnel on the basis of their face matching ability. 

Within this project we developed a number of tools for detecting high levels of face matching performance among potential employees. These tests are now being used by a very wide number of agencies as part of their selection procedures. These include HM Passport Office, the Metropolitan Police, Police Scotland, Nottinghamshire Police, the Australian Passport Authority, Immigration New Zealand, and the Swedish Migration Agency. 

In early 2016, HM Passport Office began the process of developing a specialist face matching team. There are over five million passport applications per year in the UK, and granting passports to fraudulent applicants has clear negative consequences. The new specialist team will focus entirely on making decisions on the faces of applicants, in those cases deemed difficult by staff handling routine cases. The team is currently being selected using some tests developed on this project. Furthermore, we have provided commentaries on the applicants' performance profile case-by-case. The recruiters are highly sensitive to issues arising from this project, and are determined to make their decisions on solid evidence. We have undertaken to give briefings to these operational staff, and to monitor their accuracy, using the tools developed on this project. This process is on-going, but will provide increased security across the whole UK public. 

Finally, we hope to have influenced professional bodies in making evidence-based decisions on face matching policy. In 2015, as part of this project, we ran the first York Applied Face Recognition Meeting. This highly successful meeting was attended by academics as well as representatives from several Police Constabularies, the Home Office, the Government Centre for Applied Science and Technology and HM Passport Office (Border Agency, as it was then called). The meeting led to a number of collaborations, and to further invitations for the PI to speak at meetings of: The Australian Passport Authority, the Home Office, the UK Government Biometrics Working Group, the Metropolitan Police, Frontex (the Schengen Border Agency) and the Swiss Border Agency. The PhD student funded by this project now works for GCHQ, following successful and timely completion of his thesis. Each of these contacts is an opportunity to present scientific evidence to policy makers, though it is hard to measure any specific outcome from these contacts.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DBB26AA0-57E4-4A66-A7F7-EFB65D94872D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b1db67aac600.00841897</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project addressed the ways in which the same face can vary. We started with the observation that theories of face recognition do not address within-person variation, instead focussing on the differences between people. Within the project, we have proved the importance of within-person variability, making advances in (i) quantification of face variance; (ii) theoretical underpinnings of familiar face recognition; (iii) novel techniques for face learning; (iv) practical use of face recognition in real settings. 

(i) Through detailed measurement of multiple pictures of the same person, we have quantified the contribution of within- and between-person variability in face recognition. Using computational statistical analysis of images, it has been possible to understand the relative importance of different sources of variation in faces (highlight: Cognitive Science, in press). 
(ii) We have published significant theoretical papers incorporating, for the first time, within and between person variability (highlights: QJEP, 2013; Cognition, 2013, 2015; Perspectives on Psychological Science, 2015). It is beginning to be acknowledged in the literature (following our work here) that models of face recognition need to go beyond 'telling people apart', and include mechanisms for 'telling people together'. This has been the focus of recent publication by other leading international groups, all citing work on this project as their source. 
(iii) We have developed a number of novel techniques for face learning. A key component of the project is an understanding of the differences between familiar and unfamiliar faces. However, we learn new faces throughout life, and so it is important to understand how the transition from unfamiliar to familiar comes about. The techniques we have developed here are based on an understanding of within person variability, developed in the project (highlights: Journal of Vision, 2015; QJEP 2015a 2015b; British Journal of Psychology, 2015). 
(iv) We have demonstrated that unfamiliar face matching is difficult even for professionals such as passport officers and police. In fact, these groups show the same range in performance as untrained observers. However, techniques relying on processing the within-person variability are successful in improving performance (highlights, PloS ONE, 2014, 2015; JEP Applied, 2014). 

In addition to these scientific advances, we have developed a network of face recognition practitioners. As part of the project Burton visited Border Agencies in the UK, Europe and Australia (including Schengen Frontex; Swiss Border Agency; Australian Passport Authority). We held a workshop for practitioners in York in 2015 which was highly successful. This led to current work with the UK Border Agency (now renamed UK Visas and Immigration), with Scotland Yard, and with the Home Office. 

The personnel on this project have benefitted from training and career advancement. Kay Ritchie (postdoc on the project) is about to take up a position working in a world-renowned face perception lab in Perth, Australia. Andrew Dowsett, linked PhD student on the project, submitted his thesis within three years, and passed his viva in November 2015. He now works for GCHQ in Cheltenham. Both have published very good papers from work on this project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Results from the project are already being used by border agencies in the UK and Australia. Our research shows that the best way to optimise passport-matching performance is to focus on selection of operational personnel, rather than training. We are working with both these agencies in order to develop techniques for personnel selection. We have also worked with the Metropolitan Police 'super-recogniser unit', and offered various ways of screening for exceptional performance in their officers. 

Our research will have long-lasting theoretical implications for understanding face recognition. The topic of within-person variability has been ignored (in fact, deliberately controlled out of experiments) for many years. Our work not only points out the importance of within-, as well as between-person variability, it also quantifies this. This is critically important, as it gives a technique for future study of the problem. There are already papers beginning to appear in the literature which acknowledge this, and we believe this to be a major contribution arising from the project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8BF3C840-D557-4F86-AE7C-4467655FF620</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>568bba7dc4fd92.58747367</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.facevar.com/home</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D8AC8B93-93DB-4A10-AED8-EBED6D2DFF58</gtr:id><gtr:title>Natural variability is essential to learning new faces</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Visual Cognition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ab72aadedfcbb3a1d591d3e0d9f26b14"><gtr:id>ab72aadedfcbb3a1d591d3e0d9f26b14</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kramer R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589462677253a0.81812730</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FBA749A8-99D5-4D6D-B580-B0A1580CBFFE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding face familiarity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/97bb10951c0d4a1b44ded5bb087ae8d3"><gtr:id>97bb10951c0d4a1b44ded5bb087ae8d3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kramer RSS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0010-0277</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a732cb2143709.48959460</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1A673B76-DFAE-4AC3-8DA1-27E508108A29</gtr:id><gtr:title>A familiarity disadvantage for remembering specific images of faces.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental psychology.
