But such causal statements have been quickly dismissed as elliptical by philosophers. The real cause is some event or other, such as 'Alice's shoving Tilly...' or 'the magnet's being placed near the iron filings...'. \n\nI reject this dominant view. By refusing to acknowledge the role that substances play in a complete causal story, we miss out on the real engines of change. Since it is enduring substances, not events, that the bearers of causal powers, both substances and events should be recognised as causes. \n\nI shall argue that this account of substance causation can further our understanding of action. In particular, it forces us to revaulate the question: how are agents, and their reasons, related to their actions? I shall argue that the account vindicates the intuitive idea that agents act for reasons. Reasons are not the causes of what we do - agents are. But agents act in light of certain reasons they possess. \n\nBy defending the reality of substance causation, we thereby rethink the idea that the causal history of the universe consists in a mere 'flux of events'. If inanimate objects can do things, so too can animals and humans. With substance causation everywhere, the challenge becomes not that of trying to find which events in the flux amount to the activity of an agent, but rather that of distinguishing between different forms of substance causation. In the last part of the project, I shall argue that free agent causation is distinguished from other forms of substance causation by the fact that it is not subsumable under laws, be they deterministic or indeterministic.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research has no immediate impact beyond academic circles. However, understanding our place in nature, and how our agency can be preserved in the face of scientific and philosophical challenges, is of interest to the wider community. And I would be happy to discuss these issues in a popular format if a good opportunity for such a dialogue presented itself. (But I will not actively seek to do this during the period of the fellowship.)</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>During this research grant, I developed a new argument for the claim that substances can be causes. I answered objections to this claim, thus clearing the way for the view that agents can be causes. This has now been accepted for publication at the Journal of the American Philosophical Association (forthcoming). 

In addition, I brought insights from the philosophy of science, in particular, work done on the topic of ceteris paribus laws, to bear on moral responsibility. I argued for the novel claim that the ability to do otherwise is required for moral responsibility, ceteris paribus. This paper is now published with the Journal Philosophy and Phenomenological Research.

This 'Ceteris paribus, I could have done otherwise' paper opened up new research questions which I then when onto pursue in a further paper. I argued that, given a contextualist account of causation, we can offer a unified account of responsibility for the consequences of our acts and omissions. This goes against a significant body of work which aims to show that omissions and their consequences need to be treated differently from actions and their consequences. I have submitted a draft of this paper to be considered for publication, but it has not yet been published.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I think that the work I have done will be of use to researchers working on a number of areas. The first paper clears the way for an agent causal account of human action, since it argues that there is nothing metaphysically problematic in the idea of substance causation. The second paper shows that the distinction between so-called source and leeway compatibilists and incompatibilists is a false dichotomy. The negative claim that alternative possibilities are not strictly necessary for moral responsibility doesn't provide us with a positive account of the relationship between moral responsibility and the ability to do otherwise. There is middle ground between source and leeway in/compatibilism, and researchers should be concentrating their efforts here. The final paper has positive implications for the attributions of moral responsibility for the consequences of both acts and omissions. It thus has relevance for the Law and the attributions or praise and blame more generally, but these more practical implications have yet to be fully drawn out.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4B0627E1-26A8-4AF4-B563-7D7D23E65F9C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544819f6748fc3.73702262</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpr.12111/pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ACB26070-4800-44F1-BCD8-D52558DFCBE3</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Defense of Substance Causation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the American Philosophical Association</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c8b7149266de3da4cf41a99e906ce348"><gtr:id>c8b7149266de3da4cf41a99e906ce348</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ann Whittle</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56af7039666290.52062586</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C47FCFE5-54B9-4A7F-AE8B-7DDB6229711B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ceteris Paribus, I Could Have Done Otherwise</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4812c617c0423911393576c4924e270b"><gtr:id>4812c617c0423911393576c4924e270b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Whittle A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_951790094313a48d10</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4E864309-0DCE-4F77-9F77-129E397527AE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Responsibility in Context</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Erkenntnis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4812c617c0423911393576c4924e270b"><gtr:id>4812c617c0423911393576c4924e270b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Whittle A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589857df3ad261.76785057</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024887/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D3297D2-A1F7-4EE8-A676-CD04BB9D7689</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metaphysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>143EF6F8-CF59-4D04-9EA7-40D70FC41177</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Mind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
