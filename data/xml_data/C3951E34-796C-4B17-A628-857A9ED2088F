It influenced e.g. Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream and was recently dramatised by Peter Oswald for the Globe Theatre in 2002 as part of their Cupid and Psyche season. Artists as far apart in time and aesthetic outlook as Canova and the modern graphic novelist Manara are fascinated by it. This story of a young man-turned-ass by magic because of his unfettered curiosity has, however, only recently moved more into the centre of academic research. It was neglected before because of its often sexually explicit and magical content. The first book out of the eleven which form the novel sets the scene for the action. It introduces the protagonist's character, his interest in magic and his gullibility, but also important themes of the novel such as metamorphosis from man into beast. It also contains an intriguing prologue which uniquely sets out the author's new style of writing. It intentionally hides more than it reveals and itself creates a sense of curiosity in the reader, a curiosity which is acerbated by Apuleius' use of the surprisingly modern concept of an unreliable first person narrator. The first book of the novel thus contains the main themes of the novel as a whole, but in miniature, and implicates the reader of the novel in the same character fault that drives its character: curiosity. The importance of this book is clear from the fact that two commentaries have been devoted to it in the last nine years. The first one (Ruebel 2000) is intended as an aid for intermediate Latin learners, the second one (Keulen 2007) is directed at a very focused audience group of classical scholars. My own commentary would find its place next to and between these two commentaries, by keying the commentary to a readable translation of the text as envisaged by the publishers of the series which has commissioned me to write it. Both a new Latin text and a modern English translation are essential to the Aris &amp;amp; Phillips commentary series, and my intention is to open up the text and meaning of the Metamorphoses to a wider readership of scholars outside the discipline of classics as well as being of use to classicists themselves. Accordingly, the introduction will concentrate not only on the character and role of Apuleius in the literary environment of the second century AD, but also on the afterlife of the story of the Metamorphoses in literature and art up to modern times. This will allow me to look at the wide ranging influence of this novel on our culture through the Middle Ages up to today. The book will also contain a newly edited Latin text face to face with the English translation. The Latin text itself will be based on traditional scholarly analysis of the extant variant manuscript readings of the Latin text and the work of previous scholars and editors. This is essential for giving the commentary and translation a solid basis. Editing a Latin text is an essential element of classical scholarship, since the texts transmitted to us from antiquity through the Middle Ages suffered because of the nature of copying Latin texts by hand. My task as an editor will be to reconstruct a text that is grammatically correct, based on my study of the manuscript tradition as well as on the scholarly conjectures of other classicists where the transmitted text is dubious. My English translation is intended to be as close as possible to the Latin original, but not a grammatical crib. I want to bring out especially the literary texture of the Metamorphoses and the rhetorical, often flowery style of Apuleius. The commentary part of the project with its concentration on explaining the text's allusions, meaning and stylistic peculiarities will allow me to concentrate less on linguistic questions, but on literarythemes, allusions and influences on Apuleius as well as Apuleius' influence on subsequent writers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The commentary is mainly directed at an academic audience, but I would envisage some wider interest in the project as well. The novel is the prevalent genre in modern literature and culture. In a year where the complete Man Booker shortlist consisted of historical novels (2009), a wider audience, academic and non-academic, may be drawn to finding out more about the origin of the genre, a genre which in the Western world has started with Apuleius' Golden Ass. The Metamorphoses is the earliest completely extant Latin novel and as such very influential in the Western world as the ancestor of the now prevalent literary genre of the novel. The modern novel incorporates all genres, for example drama, philosophical treatises or lyrical poetry, and this has been anticipated by Apuleius' novel. Book one of the Metamorphoses contains an exploration of contemporary popular comic drama as well as the story of a character called Socrates who, although having some things in common with the philosopher, is in many respects his antithesis. Thus Apuleius' novel can be seen to anticipate our modern understanding of the genre. Anybody interested in the roots of the novel needs to consider its origins in Apuleius, and my commentary intends to open the way for them.\nThe Golden Ass is in many ways a timeless novel: a gullible and unreliable first person narrator finds himself placed in Kafkaesque situations of the supernatural kind (exposure to witches and metamorphosis into a donkey) and has to brave this frightening scenario all on his own. The scene for this alienation of the character, so common in modern literature and experienced by modern society, is set in book one of the Metamorphoses.\nAnother envisaged audience is future students. The accessibility of the commentary's format (commentary keyed into a translation rather than into the Latin text) will reach students without specialist knowledge of the Latin language, and open up this Latin novel for teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate levels in classics and related disciplines.\nIn order to enhance dissemination of this material, I intend to create short podcasts downloadable from my website. Small pieces (5 - 10 min long) but very focused on one specific aspect of my research, accompanied by a small paragraph or so on the website with further literature should open up various themes raised by the commentary and its literary studies to a wider audience. Podcasting equipment is already available in the department. I will be able to get advice on publicising podcasts from Gurbir Singh, who is currently running an existing and successful podcast series on astronomy.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56588</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I have produced various podcasts to disseminate my findings, as promised in the impact statement.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2FDB1A8D-7141-4F84-83FE-8BA95696E7A9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9f7c68f795.49722393</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Apuleius' Metamorphoses, our first and only complete Latin novel, has inspired artists and authors from the second century AD onwards until today.

During my grant, I successfully published a translation, introduction, edition and commentary on Metamorphoses 1, as promised as the main output. I also realised that I needed to expand on various aspects of the text in more detail than was possible in a commentary. Therefore I published articles on aspects of magic, medicine, and important characters in Apuleius Metamorphoses 1.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Apart from other scholars from various fields (Classics, modern literature), the main audience of the project is is future students. The accessibility of the commentary's format (commentary keyed into a translation rather than into the Latin text) reaches students without specialist knowledge of the Latin language, and opens up this Latin novel for teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate levels in classics and related disciplines. The reviews of my 2013 book so far bear this out, commenting on its accessibility and usefulness for teaching.

During my research I realised that there was much demand for a study of the reception of Apuleius' Metamorphoses beyond 1600, and my new project, planned for 2016-2018, is to work on this aspect of the text: The Reception of Cupid and Psyche from 1600 to Today. Cupid and Psyche is an inset tale contained in the Metamorphoses, and has been studied as a standalone text before. I am organising an international conference in 2016 to bring scholars together to study this text in more detail in its impact on literature, music, arts and philosophy. After the conference, I will be editing a conference volume and write a study on the literary impact of Cupid and Psyche together with my co-organiser Prof. Stephen Harrison (Corpus Christi College, Oxford).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BF283032-BF15-4654-B458-27DFFCBD07C1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dda309c368c5.77296585</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DEBBA95E-9F55-46D3-85FC-9ED443BEAEBA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Review of: .
