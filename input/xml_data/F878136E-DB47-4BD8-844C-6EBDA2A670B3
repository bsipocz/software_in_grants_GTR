Chikungunya (CHIK) virus has the potential of generating chronic debilitating rheumatologic conditions (such as joint pain and limiting physical activity) which enlarges its epidemiological and economic effects mainly in tropical countries. Despite its importance, the actual magnitude of CHIK virus at a global level remains poorly understood. Although the global explosion of CHIK outbreaks started a decade ago, and by now has reached all continents some local studies have suggested that actually outbreaks have probably passed unrecognised for several decades. Given this, we hypothesize that the size of each outbreak will depend mainly on the levels of previous exposure in the population. Based on this principle, the aim of this research is to identify the global burden of CHIK infection based on the use of mathematical and statistical modelling to assess the probability of previous exposure based on its ecological suitability. Then, the real magnitude in terms of morbidity, disability, mortality and economics costs can be projected at a global level. The results of this research will inform not only policy makers but also researchers and potential funders for vaccines and other possible interventions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim of this project is to estimate the global burden of CHIK in terms of infections, acute and chronic cases, deaths, disability-adjusted-life-years and the associated economic costs. The study will follow a multistage approach where first key parameters of the spread of the infection will be estimated, with particular interest in patterns of age specific attack rates, from both primary or secondary data sources. Second, a progression model that accounts for chronic outcomes will be built based on clinical data from a cohort study already available. Third, global projections will be produced based on environmental suitability and population data. Fourth, direct and indirect global costs (direct and indirect) will be projected based on the disease burden and the gross domestic product country. This will be a unique scientific opportunity to explore and combine multiple sources of information to inform future research on one of the less studied arboviral infections. Also, this research with require multidisciplinary and multilateral collaboration, which will strengthen relations with other research groups and health officials in endemic countries and at WHO. The results will be an important basis for informing policy makers and funders of vaccine and other control interventions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>290651</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R024855/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
