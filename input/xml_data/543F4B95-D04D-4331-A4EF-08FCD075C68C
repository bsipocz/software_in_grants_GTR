It homes in on Spain and France (as sites of production, distribution and reception) and Britain (as a site of distribution and reception), and on lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer films and their audiences/viewers. Building on previous film historical work on the processes of transnationalization of cinema and on recent shifts in thinking about queer cultural identities, the project examines specific cases of the trans-European traffic of films and film makers in the context of the notions of queer culture and queer cinema and in the period 1990 to the present day. It examines: the question of the translatability in images of formations of desire; questions of audience and critical reception and cultural translation in relation to taste, fantasy, desire and values; the relationship between cultural flows and the formation and representation of queer identities in national and transnational contexts. It has a close match to aspects of the AHRC Emerging Theme on Translating Cultures and the potential to link with developments therein.\n\nThe work involves: archival and web-based investigation (including on-line forums and fan sites); festival visits; film and performance analysis; and audience research. The project will advance the current state of audience research by: engaging with media production and its reception across four languages (Spanish, French, Catalan, English); recruiting its participants across a range of digital and physical audience locations; focusing on queer cinematic production which both chronicles the local (in portraying sub-national identities) and draws on the global (borrowing, translating, transferring, and often exoticising foreign models of queer life). Analyses of the films and performances will take into account discourses and theories of sexuality and difference. The audience research and festival-based presentations directly involve queer communities in a range of locations. \n\nSpecifically, analysis will include responses in France to the films of Pedro Almod&amp;oacute;var, Ventura Pons, Marta Balletb&amp;oacute;-Coll, Cesc Gay, and others; in Spain of the films of Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Ozon, Sebastien Lifshitz, Andr&amp;eacute; Techin&amp;eacute;, Josiane Balasko, Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau and others; and in Britain to a range of niche-market and festival-based queer French and Spanish cinema (in various formats). The two Investigators have a substantial record in queer cultural analysis and bring together complementary, relevant areas of expertise, as further detailed in the Justification of Resources and the Case for Support.\n\nOne joint-authored monograph, seven articles, six conference papers, and a range of local presentations and discussion groups are planned for production starting within the period of the project with a further , linked monograph brought to completion during the first three months (capitalizing on preceding, institutionally supported leave).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Clearly the project is concerned with audiences and individual subjects beyond a traditionally scholarly readership. Consequently, it seeks not only to probe queer interpretative communities and their interaction with the films as objects of the study, but also to connect with these community elements. Festival-based presentations in France, Spain and Britain will target local audiences in order to further debate within interested collectives on issues of queer identity and citizenship. A series of project-related screenings will be organised at the Cornerhouse Manchester (with whom the investigators have an established history of collaboration). The programming team of the London LGBT Festival 2010 have been contacted and are willing to take part in pilot interviews in 2011 and full participation of programmers and select audiences in 2012 and 2013. From March 2013 onwards, events as detailed in the Impact Plan will be organised in conjunction with the regular and festival/showcase programming. There is strong potential for this strand of the activities to be continued on beyond the life of the project. \n\nThe aim will not be to view the audiences studied as passive objects of scrutiny, but also to empower them within the framework of the project by asking them to suggest films for screenings or involving them in question and answer sessions with directors, stars, etc.. Key issues at stake will be cross-border and cross-cultural understanding, new ways of seeing the relationship of self to (queer or European) community, and welfare and quality of life for 'minority' groups.\n\nThe engagement with local lesbian, gay and queer communities and groups is essential to the project, which reaches beyond the existing established audiences for Spanish and French queer cinemas (and UK- and US-based readerships and viewers) through advertisements and publicity campaigns in the lesbian, gay and queer press, local radio and LGBT local news websites retail outlets and related establishments. Contacts already established with Manchester City Council and the Lesbian and Gay Foundation (Manchester) will facilitate interface with broader educational and health and well-being campaigns.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>226687</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>After-Screening Event at Cornerhouse Manchester</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F308D51-7163-4C9E-B219-DBDCF477FD16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>c 100 people attended screening of French gay film and were given questionnaires (20 responses) and invited to open discussion following film

It is anticipated that the book (along with the outputs already in the public domain, and further outputs pending) will show in detail how the production and circulation of lesbian gay queer and trans films in Spain and France have specific effects on individuals and audiences who watch and consume these films. We have discovered many ways in which 'non-Anglo' films can be meaningful in enabling LGBTQ viewers, and indeed others, to understand themselves, their social relations and their lives going forward. 

The key features of the outputs published and to be published are:

--A full comparative cultural history of LGBTQ film since the 1990s in France and Spain and of its activist and theory-inspired connections
--A detailed study of audience reception, working with an extensive corpus of responses and broad use of social networking sites and the popular LGBTQ press 
--Coverage of LGBTQ festivals in Barcelona, Bilbao, London, Lyon, Madrid, Manchester, Paris and Toulouse 
--Analysis of short, independent, ephemeral and documentary film production as well as commercially-pitched feature films
--Examination of cross-border impact of the auteur and big-name directors (e.g. Pedro Almod&amp;oacute;var, Cesc Gay, S&amp;eacute;bastien Lifshitz, Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Ozon) 
--Cross-mapping of findings onto mainstream LGBTQ critical reception, written in Catalan, English, French, and Spanish</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Community groups (in Madrid Paris, Manchester) may be able to develop work on well-being and cross-cultural understanding in relation to sexuality and equality by reference to the findings.

Festival programmers for LGBTQ events will be able to take into consideration the detailed audience responses to be reported on when making programming decisions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F825B407-3A43-4775-9D04-B30BFE339654</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f7be7434db3.84805070</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/research/allprojects/transnationaldesires/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0FADE10E-BE5F-404F-9DD2-15909D90DF9D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Le cin&amp;eacute;ma espagnol - Histoire et culture</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6ef4a5109d2f9c7f9007fd310641856a"><gtr:id>6ef4a5109d2f9c7f9007fd310641856a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Murray R, Perrriam C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn> 9782200281229</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>541a9bf7bd1769.59111298</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D407334E-3527-49E8-94C1-EE7E3A49D29A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spanish Queer Cinema</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9679d08d5c1e65409da06e6729b9357e"><gtr:id>9679d08d5c1e65409da06e6729b9357e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Perriam C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780748665869</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>541a995196db19.73788423</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EEB9EF63-095A-46E1-947A-6F5D0795DA35</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Troubling transformations: Pedro Alm&amp;oacute;dovar's La piel que habito / The Skin I Live In (2011) and its reception'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transnational Cinemas</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0f059001a4f852168b5ee77d1f2a242f"><gtr:id>0f059001a4f852168b5ee77d1f2a242f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Murray R, Waldron D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541aaa5a3dd8e9.90359135</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A8A805A5-BA5D-47B8-88B7-BED60DD1B163</gtr:id><gtr:title>Activism, affect, identification: trans documentary in France and Spain and its reception</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Studies in European Cinema</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/63604023ea42276e54fbc31decbd7522"><gtr:id>63604023ea42276e54fbc31decbd7522</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Murray, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54be19bcdad716.04596394</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1149233A-0A25-4FDF-BA6A-C6214A429AA5</gtr:id><gtr:title>French and Spanish Queer Film: Audiences, Communities and Cultural Exchange</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bdd17ff0906037d0b601c2ef35d8f1fa"><gtr:id>bdd17ff0906037d0b601c2ef35d8f1fa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Perriam Chris</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780748699193</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56d1a1940e74c3.20938494</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I026618/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD9F0C26-AA57-4235-8010-AEBAF429C756</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
