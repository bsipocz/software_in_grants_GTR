In developing countries, the burden of lifestyle disease affects young and middle-aged adults, therefore constraining livelihoods, long-term health, and economic development. Thus far the private sector has led responses to chronic illness. However approaches have focused on treatment rather than effective prevention and management of diagnosed conditions, thus increasing the social and economic burden of lifestyle diseases. 

This study will examine how the structural context of health care markets, clinical contexts of disease management, and local health beliefs and behaviours are shaping attitudes and behaviours towards health promotion and the management of chronic illness. This is the first study in India to address the medical and cultural context of chronic illness that through publication and wider dissemination strategies this research will help to inform health policy on the development of culturally and economically appropriate responses to reduce chronic morbidity and to promote healthy lifestyles. The research will therefore address this leading public health priority set out in the World Health Assembly, Action Plan 2008-2013 - ?Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases.?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Context/Aims: 
The state of Kerala has the highest prevalence in India for Type 2 Diabetes of 16.3 per cent and cardiovascular disease of 20 per cent. Chronic illness is a leading cause of disability, morbidity, and mortality. The state government has yet to address prevention of chronic disease. Responses to the epidemic have been led by the private sector, which in India accounts for 80 per cent of healthcare expenditure. This project provides an embedded understanding of the social, cultural, and clinical contexts of lifestyle disease prevention, treatment, and management. 

My doctoral research examines the commodification of health care. It explores the ways in which local biomedical culture, consumerism, and technology have shaped the ways in which health care is consumed and provided. The thesis argues that recent development has fostered a relationship of medical dependency, producing an ideology of health as a state that can be achieved through the consumption of medicines, technologies and consultations with doctors. This has important implications for the prevention and management of lifestyle diseases that will be developed through the post-doctorate fellowship. The study will explore how the context of a marketised health system, and local beliefs and practices intersect to act in relation to chronic disease. It examines the following themes: 

a) Health promotion - dietary and lifestyle behaviours, beliefs and practices for maintaining good health 
b) Response of the local health care system to chronic illness
c) Clinical context of medical care 
d) Lay understandings, management, and life with chronic illness (new data)
e) Health inequalities

Methodology
The research will provide a unique inter-disciplinary perspective to a public health problem by 

a) Combining ethnographic and epidemiological data to assess the burden of lifestyle disease (financial, physical, medical, emotional) at a household and societal level.
b) Analysing data on health beliefs/promotion through anthropological approaches to the body in South Asia and public health perspectives.
c) Using perspectives from medicine, health care systems, anthropology of science/ STS studies to analyse ethnographic data on the clinical context of care

Methods
During PhD fieldwork (Feb 2005 - Jan 2007), I conducted 1,200 hours of participant observation in six clinical settings in general medicine and cardiology to understand medical practice in relation to lifestyle diseases. I conducted participant observation with fifteen doctors to understand their medical lives and 50 semi-structured interviews with poor/middle class households regarding diet, lifestyle, and treatment behaviours.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>144662</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Training for staff working on a diabetes and lifestyle disease awareness programme in Kerala</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>75260D52-EA66-477C-B61F-F93464FE879B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Medical Trust Hospital, Kulanada, Kerala, in association with the World Diabetes Foundation is conducting a mass awareness programme to educate 500,000 people in Kerala about diabetes and other lifestyle related diseases (2008-2013). Initial findings from the research were fed back to staff in a workshop to review practices at the hospital and medical camps.


Staff received feedback about the ways in which the public responded to the hospital's education and testing programme. 
Staff became aware of and changed how they spoke to patients about glucose/ blood pressure/ cholesterol values - in order to convey ideas of chronicity.
In light of research findings, staff discussed how to improve practice and provide better support and advice to people attending the hospital and medical camps.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>P7tcc78t19Z</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Health professionals</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The following data was collected from field-sites in rural and urban Kerala (Jan 2011 - April 2011).

Participant observation in specialist diabetes/ hyper-tension clinics (in government, mission and private sector); and health camps to raise public awareness about diabetes and other lifestyle related disorders.
