This post seeks to harness and expand UK expertise through working in partnership with other Research Councils, in-country organisations (e.g. research organisations, UK Department for International Development, policy actors, communities and charities), international organisations (e.g. Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations, World Bank, US National Institute of Aging) and existing investments (e.g. MRC's existing units, the Wellcome Trust and NIA's existing cohort studies in developing countries) to build capacity for data collection, research and analysis within and between countries and regions to enable better targeted development initiatives.

There are three key elements to this post: 
1. To develop a strategic understanding of the issues and opportunities offered by this research, and help plan and execute appropriate subsequent activities to strengthen capacity in this area. 
2. To play an active role in CLOSER's UK activities through, for example, research activity, communication and impact or assistance with training and capacity building.
3. To carry out high-quality research based on quantitative analysis of longitudinal studies in a development context.

The post holder and their GCRF work will be guided by, and report to, a small steering group of senior academics. They will be a member of the CLOSER team based at UCL's Institute of Education and will managed by CLOSER's Director, Professor Alison Park. Some overseas travel will be expected as part of the role.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The GCRF Senior Research Associate will need to engage with a wide range of stakeholders as part of their development of a strategic understanding of the issues and opportunities involved in longitudinal research in an international development context. They will need to identify possible strategies to overcome key barriers to this sort of work, and where appropriate implement these. 

Consequently, a range of the Research Associate's activities will relate to impact, and will require working with a wide range of stakeholders, both within and outwith the UK. 

Example activities include: 
* Working effectively with stakeholders within the UK and overseas, engaging with other relevant activities funded through the GCRF or of relevance to international development. Key stakeholders will include longitudinal studies (the CLOSER studies in particular) and research funders (including the ESRC, MRC and Wellcome) 
* Developing a programme of activities aimed at building capacity (eg training workshops), and promoting impact, in relation to longitudinal research within developing countries
* Identifying and promoting opportunities for greater engagement between CLOSER and relevant UK-based and international longitudinal studies
* Developing lasting relationships, including generating proposals and exploring future collaboration between the UK and international studies 
* Horizon scanning and promoting for opportunities to apply for GCRF funding, identifying networks of relevance to longitudinal studies.
* Reflecting on the effectiveness of the existing GCRF longitudinal fellowships scheme, and share learning with the ESRC and other relevant actors in the longitudinal studies' environment. 
* Contributing where required to activities that promote the value of longitudinal studies. Areas where contributions would be particularly useful include promoting CLOSER's work and developing training and capacity building materials.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>304886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R008086/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
