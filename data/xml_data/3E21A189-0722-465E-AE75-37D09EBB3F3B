The key to the predictive power and accuracy of the approach is the treatment of the quantum mechanical exchange and correlation interactions of the electrons. Present-day approximations for these contributions are limited to a narrow comfort zone of applicability - the work in this proposal will develop new approximations to significantly expand the range of viable applications. Methods to describe the exchange and correlation contributions to the energy are often relatively simple models based on the electronic density distribution and its gradient. Higher accuracy can be obtained using first-principles techniques based on the many-electron wave function. In this work we construct a common framework for the comparison of these expensive high accuracy approaches with simple density-functional approximations. This framework gives new insight into the development of new simple models - in particular the higher derivatives of the density are highlighted as a key variables for the description of electronic correlation. Functionals based on this quantity will be developed in this work, opening the way to more accurate and robust correlation treatments - removing error cancellations that plague present-day approximations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will introduce a paradigm shift in the way density-functional approximations are constructed. The proposed models differ significantly from widely used approximations based on the gradient of the electronic density and are informed and inspired by the use of highly accurate ab initio quantum chemical techniques. To allow for this cross-fertilization a common language and computational framework is introduced for the representation of density-functional and wave function based models, giving a unified treatment in an easily visualizable real space representation.

The impacts of density-functional theory have been far reaching in many areas of modern science, a fact reflected in the number of citations acquired by key papers in the area. The paper describing the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, which give a foundation to the theory, has been cited more than 22000 times. The paper describing the Kohn-Sham equations, which represents the most common practical implementation of the theory, has been cited more than 23000 times. Popular functionals have also amassed considerable citations: BLYP (26998), PBE (37070), B3LYP (47243). These reflect the widespread usage desnity-functional theory has enjoyed, as a relatively simple, essentially black box, approach that can be utilized by theorists and experimentalists alike.

This proposal aims to construct models for the exchange-correlation energy that maintain this simplicity whilst offering a significant shift in performance. Preliminary work using high accuracy ab initio approaches suggests that a key ingredient to enable a higher accuracy description of the correlation energy is the Laplacian of the density. This quantity is often overlooked in functional construction. However, this proposal aims to utilize this simple quantity more directly and effectively in new models. The simplicity of these models means that they will be easily implementable in a huge range of density-functional software used in molecular and solid state simulations.

This theory is the most widely use method for the quantum mechanical simulation of molecules and materials, however, its accuracy is determined (and often limited by) the quality of approximations that describe these key interactions. To make progress towards new and more accurate exchange-correlation approximations we have made use of high level ab initio methods in this project. 

We have developed a new program to calculate the exchange-correlation energy density in different regions of space with in a molecular system, this is the target that practical density-functionals must try to approximate. We have made the evaluation of these energy densities efficient and calculated these functions for a wide range of systems. In addition we have for the first time calculated these quantities for open shell systems (with unpaired electrons) and resolved these contributions into parts corresponding to interactions between like and opposite spin electrons. These advances make it significantly more straightforward to use this data in the context of density-functional development, where most approximations are phrased in spin-polarised manner.

We have investigated the extent to which the use of the Laplacian (second derivative of the electron density) may be exploited to develop new density-functional methods. Our early results in this project are promising and suggest this ingredient may be of significant utility in new density-functionals based on modelling the exchange-correlation energy density. We have extended our program to include range-separated approaches and applied these techniques to separate the exchange-correlation energy density in short-range and long-range components, giving new routes to this important class of functionals. Building on these observations we have extended our program to perform calculations in the context of current-density-functional theory, allowing for the study of molecules in magnetic fields. A system of range-separated functionals has been developed, including the required current dependence, at the meta-GGA level. By incorporating range-separated treatments of both exchange and correlation effects we have been able to study the nature of the exchange and correlation treatments required for different properties. Our findings have highlighted the significance of medium-range correlation in the description of magnetic properties such as molecular magnetzabilities and nuclear magnetic resonance shielding constants. They also provide insight into the shortcomings of typical density-functional approximations in this area and possible routes to improvement. 

Efforts to treat strong/static correlation effects, important for a wide range of materials applications, have proven more challenging. In collaboration with Prof. Gori-Giorgi's group at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, we have made use of the strictly correlated limit of electrons to parameterize models of the molecular exchange-correlation energy density. Our results show promise for significantly improved accuracy over existing density-functional approaches. However, significant challenges remain for system in which correlation effects involve significant proportions of static correlation and dynamic correlation simultaneously. Our accurate ab initio data is currently being used to understand how to build further improved approximations for these cases.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings in this work are being taken forward to develop new density-functional approximations. The insights offered by the calculation of molecular energy densities (a key outcome of this work) will help researchers in the field to improve these approximations further. A key point is that these quantities can now be spin-resolved making them amenable for use in functional development work. Density-functionals are used routinely by researchers in chemistry, physics and materials science for calculations on molecular and solid state systems and the findings in this work will help to improve the accuracy of the predictions that can be obtained from these calculations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>94799378-CABC-44E5-9BF2-D3BFF318D531</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd588cb56c58.73169494</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>We have implemented a new rapid development platform for quantum chemistry using the python language coupled with just-in-time compilation techniques.
