Today, strict enforcement of EHR anonymization protocols and highly-controlled data management have allowed medical research to progress while patient privacy protection is fully ensured. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key technology that can unleash the potential of EHR for personalized medicine. By rapidly analysing vast amounts of data and learning key data features that doctors and researchers may not immediately see, AI predictions can give more comprehensive insights into a patient's health. 

The advancement in AI has the potential to support medical decision for disease management. For example, in the management of infectious diseases, a major tension exists between two medical decisions - when to start antimicrobial treatment and when to stop. On the one hand, early treatment with antimicrobials could lead to better outcomes, but only if there really is infection. However, prompt and accurate diagnosis can be difficult as the subset of symptoms used as indicators of infection may be caused by other clinical conditions. On the other hand, an ideal treatment regimen should aim to avoid unnecessary use of antimicrobials in order to reduce or stabilise antimicrobial resistance. However, knowing the right time to stop antimicrobial treatment is difficult as improving clinical outcomes can be hard to measure and a causal relationship is challenging to prove. Hence, development of methods with faster and higher predictive accuracy is critical to achieve better treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of developing antimicrobial resistance. AI has the capability to rapidly derive key insights from complex and long-range data, such as EHRs, that may have been previously impossible to do by humans. It does this by rapidly re-evaluating its analysis as more and more data is received - thus, refining its ability to cross reference complex data, find correlations and consider seemingly unrelated external factors that doctors and researchers may not immediate deem relevant. 

This project aims to develop two AI models using anonymised EHRs - one to diagnose various medical conditions and the other to provide optimal treatment decisions tailored to individual patients. To evaluate the performance of the AI model for the diagnosis prediction task, we will compare the network's with several state-of-the-art models by considering the timeliness of the prediction in addition to other metrics that quantify accuracy and discrimination. To evaluate the AI model for treatment decisions, we will compare its performance against physician performance across metrics such as mortality rate, length of hospital stay, etc.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The data set is made of anonymised EHRs from the Great Osmond Street Hospital. Over time, we look to engage the NIHR Health Informatics Collaborative and other hospitals that are part of HDR London and HDR UK to collaboratively expand the data set.

In the diagnosis network, we exploit a deep recurrent neural network architecture. We model EHR data using multi-task Gaussian processes (MGP) - a probabilistic model used to handle missing values and irregularly spaced observation times - and employ Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to capture long-range dependencies and nonlinear dynamics. We implement a multi-level deeply supervised network by introducing companion objective functions for each hidden layer that we will combine with the final loss value. We will also explore the effect of attention mechanisms on performance. We will compare the network performance with several state-of-the-art models and consider timeliness along with other metrics that quantify discrimination and accuracy.

In the network where the goal is to learn optimal treatment regimens, we exploit a deep reinforcement learning architecture. We adopt an MGP-LSTM module to impute and interpolate the discretised EHR inputs, and employ a duelling Q-network architecture to learn the Q-values. The expected loss and gradient in the MGP layer will be approximated using a fixed number of Monte Carlo sampling. A different action-reward training environment will be structured for each disease explored. To speed up learning, we will explore prioritised experience. We will compare the network and physician performance using the estimated expected total Q-values.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313016</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/S004041/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
