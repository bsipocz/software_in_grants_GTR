The aim of this research network is to challenge these tendencies through an exploration of indigenous perspectives on sustainability and the use of creative means to express alternatives.

'Sumak kawsay' is a Kichwa word meaning 'good living'. It has become hugely prominent in Latin America in recent years, featuring in the Ecuadorean and Bolivian constitutions since 2008 and 2009 respectively. Its basic principles include concern for the environment, peaceful communal living and the reduction of inequalities, both economic and social. While these principles might seem to align well with the discourse of sustainable development as expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals, from the perspective of indigenous communities, sumak kawsay should not be equated with the concept 'development', however sustainable. Instead, it offers a decolonial, post-developmentalist alternative approach to human civilisation and aspirations. As one prominent thinker has put it, '[sumak kawsay] helps us see the limits of current development models and it allows us to dream of alternatives' (Gudnyas).

But sumak kawsay is not a global panacea either. Where it has been mainstreamed in Latin America, indigenous communities tend to feel that it has been usurped and used as a way to foist development upon them by making it sound like their voices are being heard in national fora. It also cannot be assumed that all indigenous communities understand sumak kawsay to mean the same thing, nor that sumak kawsay as understood by indigenous communities will automatically herald a state of perfect harmony and equality.

The research network proposed here will focus on these issues in collaboration with indigenous communities in the Northeast of Brazil and the Southwest of Colombia; communities where there is a manifest appetite to address them. It addresses a gap in extant research on the subject by looking beyond Ecuador and Bolivia's mainstreaming of the concept and by seeking to dream of alternatives beyond the debates about sumak kawsay versus sustainable development. We intend to do this by networking our research across the academic/non-academic divide to pool critical resources, making this process manifest in the form of a multilingual 'affective cartography'. This will consist of a website that is a combination of research with art and activism (artivism) and that seeks to find a more egalitarian, subtle, multi-voiced way for the ideas that come out of the network to be expressed. It is not about fixing, defining or appropriating a given culture or its worldview, but about allowing for the expression of relationships and multiple perspectives, through whatever media seem most appropriate. We will seek to position this digital resource as a point of reference for other indigenous and marginalised communities across Latin America and the Anglophone world.

The activities of the research network are built around on-going in-community events run by project coordinators in Brazil and Colombia, and two main in-community workshops bridging the academic/non-academic research divide. This will be complemented by three international symposia to be held at participating universities in Brazil, Colombia and the UK and open to all network members. The overall emphasis in the proposal on in-community work seeks to ensure that indigenous participants in the network remain the intellectual fulcrum of the project. 

The network will also publish its findings in a special issue of a prestigious peer-reviewed journal and keep a log of its activities through a project website.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary non-academic beneficiaries of this research network will be the indigenous communities in the northeast of Brazil (for example, the Kariri-Xoc&amp;oacute;, the Pankararu, the Tupinamb&amp;aacute; and the Patax&amp;oacute;-H&amp;atilde; H&amp;atilde; H&amp;atilde;e) and the southwest of Colombia (primarily the Nasa community) with whom we will co-research the relationship of Sumak Kawsay and the Sustainable Development Agenda, and ways for communities to selectively, critically and creatively (re)appropriate these discourses. Nonetheless, the design of our network will also draw in non-academic activists and community members from further afield in Brazil and Colombia, and from other countries in Latin America where the discourse of Sumak Kawsay has been more extensively developed, for example Bolivia and Ecuador. Furthermore, the research agenda is not only of relevance for indigenous or other marginalised communities in Latin America, but seeks to address a topic that is both timely and important for the whole of humanity. We therefore anticipate that mainstream society with a concern for the environment, sustainability and community wellbeing in both Latin America as well as in the UK will benefit from engagement with this project.

Our project partners in Brazil and Colombia, the NGO Thydew&amp;aacute; and the Pueblos en Camino communication-action initiative, will enable the research network to connect with its primary non-academic beneficiaries through their long-standing and successful work in these indigenous communities. These organisations will also allow the network to reach a wider public in Latin America, both indigenous and non-indigenous, marginalised and mainstream, through their own extensive networks of contacts. In the UK we aim to open up debate on the topic with local community groups and relevant branches of national organisations as a follow-up to events held in Leeds and Bristol. This will enable the network to connect with mainstream UK society with a vested interest in the subject matter of the resetwork and an openness to learn from the experiences of communities in Latin America.

The intended benefits of the research network for the primary non-academic beneficiaries include strengthening these communities' ability to make informed decisions about development issues and formulate plans of action through enhanced levels of self-knowledge and resilience, and helping to build capacity within the communities for articulating 'the future they want' more effectively in local, national, regional and global fora. We also intend for the network to contribute to the lessening of the gap between indigenous communities and academics and thus allow for a greater valorisation of the potential of indigenous communities to contribute to wider academic and societal debates concerning sustainability and development. 

For mainstream society in both Latin America and the UK, the research network will help to offer an insight into an important and timely alternative discourse to development, sustainable or otherwise. Mainstream society will benefit from this research network in so far as further consideration of alternatives to development helps to consolidate a shift towards a global society that can limit climate change, for example. 

We will use our outputs - the multi-lingual project website and the creative digital artefact which we refer to as an 'affective cartography' - to disseminate our collaborative research findings within and beyond the primary non-academic beneficiaries. We will also seek to frame parts of the above outputs in such a way that the communities involved may choose, if they wish, to disseminate them to such external bodies - local, national and international - that lobby for indigenous rights and/or are directly involved in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51898</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R004242/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04B7A494-75A7-4241-9AA9-A7791BD4328A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic &amp; Latin American Stud</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9EFA3E9E-2186-4589-A542-814A214E3D57</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic, Portguese &amp; Latin</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D5E20EB-F470-4A70-9B72-5D68D7AFB1EB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Nat Resources, Env &amp; Rural Dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
