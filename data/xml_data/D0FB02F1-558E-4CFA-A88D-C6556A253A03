In this project we will develop two micro-algae to fix atmospheric CO2 and convert it using sunlight into raw material for biodiesel production. The main obstacles which have to be overcome are to develop strains of algae which can grow at high temperature [as flue gasses are going to be used as the source of CO2] as well as efficiently converting the CO2 into carbon compounds which can be used as raw materials for Biodiesel production. The work is being undertaken with a major Biofuels manufacturer and the knowledge gained should advance us both scientifically and industrially.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Nannochloropsis and Synechocystis will be engineered to accumulate lipids in the form of triacylglycerols [TAGs] as feedstocks for biodiesel production. The end objective is to sequester CO2 from flue gasses , so reducing CO2 output, and converting this into storage lipids and reducing the demand for fossil based fuels. The projects will use both acclimation , random mutagenesis and targeted gene expression to achieve this goal. In Nannochorposis initial considerations will be on increasing the temperature at which the organism can be grown. EST sequencing will be performed to identify genes involved in TAG biosynthesis and altering their expression so that TAG biosynthesis is maximal during the exponential stage of growth. Manipulation of the fatty acid profile will be undertaken to increase the level of saturated fatty acids. In Synechocystis genes will be introduced to divert metabolism from MGDG and DGDG synthesis towards TAG as well as optimise the flow of metabolites towards fatty acid biosynthesis. The fatty acid profile will be manipulated to favor a profile best for biodiesel production. Considerations will be made on the best way to harvest and process both organisms for lipid extraction.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The following sectors of society will benefit from this research: PUBLIC with reduced CO2 emissions - which is in line with Government policies ACADEMIA - with advances in our understanding of metabolic pathways and how to engineer/control them INDUSTRY - obtaining micro-organisms which are engineered for industrial utilisation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>844536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project was in conjunction with Harvest Energy a major Biofuels manufacturer in the north East. It was essentially a collaboration between engineers at harvest Energy and Biologists at Durham University.
The Engineers input made two major findings which will be of economic importance in potentially establishing a cyanobacterial based system for biofuels production.
1. Harvesting from dilute solution can be made via electrolysis using units which are commercially used on oil platforms.
2. The obstacle of low light intensities and associated energy input cost can be removed by using photodiodes which only use one wavelength of light making it economically feasible to build and operate a plant in the UK.

Both of these considerations are ones which Harvest Energy could decide to invest in but this is all dependent on Boardroom discussions and the financial viability of the company.

Professor Slabas retired 18 months into the project and this was taken over by another member of academic staff.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>76EE45F4-AA99-41C2-BBA8-45BDBF1BAC06</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58b576663fa9b9.57551970</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Cyanobacteria can be grown using very limited wavelengths of light using provided by photodiodes - the exact wavelengths and intensity of light have been identified and experimentally tested. This reduces dramatically the energy input required for growth.
2.Harvesting low densities of cyanobacteria could be achieved using electrolysis which can also aid lipid isolation.
3.Recycling of spent growth media would be an essential component of design of a cyanobacterial photobioreactor.
4. Cytanobacteria can be grown using flue gas from an industrial biofuels plant. There are no detrimental contaminate which hinder growth.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The initial concept could be used as the basis for design and completion of a industrial photobioreactor which would be coupled to biofuels production. It would need the building of a managed resource , the principle researcher is now fully conversant with what would need to go into setting up such a group. This could be an ideal 10 year program requiring major Government support to drive a new industry. Industrial partners can not do this on their own. There are strong environmental and energy considerations here. It could be show case for BBSRC, EPSRC and DEFRA in joint programs aimed at translation of academic research,</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F12D6A07-F58F-4835-A569-DF7FB122E528</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b587c08fe300.86747893</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>398DA308-AEAD-4309-AA5F-BC7836C831B6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identification of components associated with thermal acclimation of photosystem II in Synechocystis sp.
