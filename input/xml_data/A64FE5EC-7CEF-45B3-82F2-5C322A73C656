It is a qualitative longitudinal research project and its primary data is letter-writing within multi-generational family networks, located in South African archive collections. Such collections are the focus because a supremely serial form of data, consequently enabling detailed investigation of change as it unfolded over the long period the research interrogates. They represent different ethnic origins, language groups, economic circumstances and areas of the country and their contents are not seen in a referential way, as sources of true or distorted facts, but as inscribing a complex representational order.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A purpose-designed Virtual Research Environment (VRE) will manage the epistolary data and provide tools to assist its analysis. Research questions include: In what ways was whiteness and its ?others? re/configured over time? How did people represent such things over time in their letter-writing? What resistances and accommodations occurred in different areas of the country and from what people and networks? An important meta-concern is, how can long-term social change best be investigated and what are the problems and possibilities of letter-writing in this.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The two types of impact which the 'Whites Writing Whiteness' Fellowship proposal is likely to generate are:

(a) Academic: Through enhancing the international knowledge economy and promoting conceptual, theoretical and methodological innovations and advancement, including the utilisation of new and innovative methodologies and techniques supported by the use of a leading-edge VRE developed in a prior ESRC project.

(b) Economic and Societal: The likely impact type here can best be summarised by rephrasing one of the ESRC's strategic priorities, as 'through increasing understanding of collective and societal behaviour and change'.

The main beneficiary groups and the potentials for such impacts regarding them are as follows:

Academic: The potential for impacts here is generated by the Fellowship programme advancing new knowledge and ways of thinking about the origins, development of and challenges to whiteness and other racialised categories and hierarchies and also regarding the South African past and the complex lived experiences of its peoples; generating a major new dataset available for secondary analysis; publishing leading-edge research in international journals; and directing Fellowship activities towards South African and UK postgraduate, postdoctoral and early career researchers as well as existing experts in the field.

Archives and Museum Sector: The potential for impacts here is generated by the Fellowship programme of research being carried out in major South African archives and museums; through its database making available useful supporting aids for collections conservation activities; promoting the importance of South African archival holdings and encouraging further use by other researchers; and thereby helping enhance the connection of sector staff with the international research community.

Documentary-Makers in the Media: The potential for impacts here is generated by the Fellowship programme demonstrating the appeal and interest of 'stories' within archive collections concerned with important aspects of the South African historical past; supporting media researchers reworking and 'translating' this in programme-making; and acting as consultant to quality documentary initiatives.

General Public - Family History and Genealogy: The potential for impacts here is generated by the Fellowship programme making available high-end fully searchable family collections research data through hriOnline; supporting this with a portfolio of quality interpretive editorial materials; and including within this detailed genealogical materials connecting the families in question with their European origins and also locating them among their wider South African interconnections.

General Public - Life Writings and Auto/Biography: The potential for impacts here is generated by the Fellowship programme focusing on lives and lived as well as represented experience; directing attention to the activities of individuals as well as networks; and ensuring quality popular data 'to the person' is part of output, in particular regarding the in-depth case study data, which will substantially include autobiographical writings as well as epistolary ones.

The project Advisory Group will involve people drawn from all five beneficiary groups and is key to impact activities. It will 'meet' virtually via Skype every six months (and face-to-face in sub-sets) and provide guidance and advice on impact pathways and also help set markers regarding impact events.

This has featured primary data as well as interpretational and theoretical essays, methodological support for carrying out archival projects, and discussions of critical whiteness and issues involved in whiteness research. Usage has been tracked in detail by collecting non-intrusive analytics, enabling the provision of facilities to follow user interest, as gauged by numbers of users, of visits, and amounts of time spent on particular pages.

There have been over 13,000 separate visitors to the website 2013-2016, a high proportion being multiple repeat visitors from over 100 countries including the UK, USA, South Africa, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, India and Kenya. Web-searches on terms including whiteness, race, letters and particular named individuals produce WWW pages in the top group of hits. While the majority of new site traffic comes via Google etc, now a third of traffic and rising is from Facebook rather than academic sources. There is a core group of 946 multiply-returning users at present. Topics dealt with in the Traces discussions of primary data and in the weekly project Blog frequently give direct rise to related inquiries. The number of visits and usages of pages has increased month on month and traffic continues rising, with a major boost expected when the full research database is published by HRIOnline in April and available for searching and using. 

Facilities for user engagement via the website have been complemented by running popular as well as academic events. In South Africa this has included week-long Summer School courses for members of the public on critically using web sources for South African research, held at the Universities of Cape Town and Pretoria, and similar one-day Summer School events at Rhodes and the University of the Free State, as well as appearances in a number of radio programmes and press interviews. 'Open day' events promoting practical uses of project research will occur over the next year. (See also 'Influence'). 

Impact in the form of take-up of various kinds has occurred as demonstrated by increasing requests for information and advice and also by more general contacts in which people provide information on how they are using material from project.

A major increase in all these activities Is anticipated once the project dataset is published by HRIOnline, as this will give users access to the complete dataset of more than 47,000 letters and a suite of advanced research tools that will support a range of detailed enquiries using these materials. The dataset with much research support material will be published by HRIOnline at http://www.whiteswritingwhiteness.org</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfe706bae7d6.16273681</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.whiteswritingwhiteness.ed.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014,2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A detailed Narrative Impact Account will be provided at the required date.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4D9EA681-490B-4B2C-8468-593857306250</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5448c28d0f25f7.27208256</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Project research questions in the ESRC application have all been addressed and answered and the key aim of the project achieved; all objectives contributing to this have been fulfilled, some more fully than others because of structural circumstances addressed in the following section. 
1. WWW has investigated the letter-writing of a range of white South Africans over a 200 year time-period, its findings showing that changes in the racial order have occurred in piecemeal ways, connected with the activities of different networks of people, in different areas, expressing sometimes very different responses from each other. The structural level has been important in political and policy respects, but with sometimes significant dislocations between this and the concerns and expressive terminologies of exchanges between interconnected letter-writers. 
2. Letters are a particularly porous 'document of life' and so a good litmus-paper for registering developments in the representational order. Important changes in the racialising aspects of letters are among WWW findings, pointing to distinctive patterns arising around South Africa's economy and the communicative technologies prevailing in different time-periods. These patterns include ethnicity and race being marked or excluded by some people and networks but not others, with the letter-writing concerned largely involving practical instrumental exchanges of a 'doing the business of the fabric of social life' kind, in staying in touch and expediting shared activity. The closer letter-writing is to quotidian concerns, the more it registers different ethnic/racial groups and individuals; the more it focuses on meta-concerns of family relationships or official life, the more there is prevailing silence about the racial order.
3. Affect and interiority are seen as key concerns of letters by migrants in other colonial contexts, not practical quotidian matters. WWW research has shown that this arises from focusing on specific groups and individuals, at a smaller scale, in particular time-periods, while the large size and more extensive temporal coverage provided by WWW data substantiates its finding of a more rounded set of letter-writing practices. These include using resonant terms and phrases now viewed as offensively racist, with such practices being tracked systematically across WWW letters. This shows nearly all such terms had 'innocent' beginnings and later accrued racial then racist connotations and meanings over time. Use of such terms is not always axiomatically pejorative, but needs to be related to the time-period, network of people, contexts of usage, and the practices of particular letter-writers. 
4. Tracing long-term changes in letter-writing concerning race matters has required developing innovative methodological strategies and techniques, to enable general patterns to be traced over time, and also individual and network-related usages to be included in the analyses made. The different collections researched have been recorded as separate databases that can be analysed individually, and also combined, within WWW's purpose-designed Virtual Research Environment (VRE), which additionally supports working in-depth on individual documents and also across them in building iterative analyses. Maintaining both figure and ground in a Qualitative Longitudinal Research approach is analytically crucial, has underpinned the trajectory of project publications, and is also important in promoting wide secondary analysis of WWW's dataset, both as a whole and of specific elements.

See also below point 2.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Supporst for users to take the research forward including in secondary data-analysis have been built-in. The existing website features both primary data and interpretive materials, provides research support with reading lists, analytical case-studies and methodological toolkits, and is extensively used. Usage is tracked with detailed analytics, with new provisions developed around user interests. 

These provisions will be extended when the full dataset is published by HRIOnline in April 2017 (and fully maintained for a seven year period minimum thereafter). Collections databases will be fully searchable and advanced research tools provided, with secondary analysis supported on individual collections; on subsets of letter-writers, time-periods and geographical areas; and across the entire dataset.

A large regular user community has been established, with the Lives and Letters maillist's c600 members, regular research seminars, and a three-site international conference series, forwarding its conceptual, theoretical and methodological aims. Invited plenary addresses by the PI in the museum and libraries, modernist editing, digital scholarship and critical whiteness contexts have further forwarded interdisciplinary engagements with project work. Publications have been targeted regarding these different research communities, including at the interface between academic and wider public groups. These initiatives will be extended post-data publication by HRIOnline, through promoting WWW's range of facilities using web-based sources and also running a series of 'open days' both in South Africa and the UK which will provide detailed information about the range of research activities that can be supported through the WWW dataset and its analysis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DDECB72A-237C-47AE-B4FF-51A102873E36</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5448c334bbf5f3.86498423</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.whiteswritingwhiteness.ed.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Public audiences</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51B25FA8-2C4B-4E34-B7C0-7E251A79327C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bfe8607f3bc7.95211787</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.whiteswritingwhiteness.ed.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Nearly 30 major archive collections of letters and connected papers have been worked on in detail in WWW research, producing linked databases concerning more than 47,000 letters.

1. WWW has pioneered development and use of a project-designed Virtual Research Environment, a sophisticated project-specific suite of research tools. This has been written at my direction with tools transcending those available in off the peg CAQDAS software, enabling analysis of its very large dataset focusing on its longitudinal characteristics, diversity of included sources and rich individual records. VRE facilities have also been used to develop the user interface for the published dataset at HRIOnline, thereby ensuring that public users have access to the same range of advanced research tools.

2. WWW research has operationalised an innovative Qualitative Longitudinal Research methodological approach which combines analysis of the entire extremely large WWW database (of over 47,000 records) with identifying and reading specific documents in close analytical detail. This approach has transcended the assumption of big/quantitative and small/qualitative and relatedly combined quantitative with qualitative work within its QLR approach. It enables its 'figure and ground' analytical concerns to both be retained, and treated as interconnected in the analyses carried out.
