In Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, concern is increasingly expressed over the implications of marriage-related migration for integration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In some ethnic minority groups, significant numbers of children and grandchildren of former immigrants continue to marry partners from their ancestral homelands. Such marriages are presented as particularly problematic: a 'first generation' of spouses in every generation may inhibit processes of individual and group integration, impeding socio-economic participation and cultural change. New immigration restrictions likely to impact particularly on such groups have thus been justified on the grounds of promoting integration. The evidence base to underpin this concern is, however, surprisingly limited, and characterised by differing and often partial understandings of the contested and politicised concept of integration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project combines analysis of relevant quantitative data sets, with qualitative research with the two largest ethnic groups involved (Indian Sikhs and Pakistani Muslims), to compare transnational ?homeland? marriages with intra-ethnic marriages within the UK. These findings will enhance understanding of the relationships between marriage-related migration and the complex processes glossed as integration, providing much needed new grounding for both policy and academic debates.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research and its findings will be useful to four primary groups of users: 

1. National policy makers: To inform integration and spousal immigration policy. Where the research identifies particular processes influencing aspects of integration, policy may be developed to target these processes more specifically. This could help reduce the danger that policies are seen to target groups rather than issues, something which in itself may undermine the perception of equality necessary for integration. 

2. Practitioners: To inform practice, advice, and service provision. Those for whom the research will be most relevant will depend on the nature of factors identified by the research, but are likely to include organisations involved in language training, employment training and career guidance, education, marriage/relationship guidance, and advice agencies. 

3. Community and religious organizations: Issues of marriage choice and immigration are significant concerns for many community organizations and religious bodies in Britain. Local NGOs, mosques and gurudwaras may be asked for advice, or offer services related to these issues. Marriage and immigration are also issues of relevance to national organizations such as the UK Shariah and Sikh Councils, and bodies representing particular groups or issues such as An-Nisa and Karma Nirvana. Findings from this research could inform the advice and services provided by such organizations. A local example of such impact from Charsley's earlier research is the development of services for migrant husbands by a South Asian community organization in Bristol previously offering services only to women. 

4. British Indian Sikh and Pakistani Muslim populations would benefit from any improvements to advice or services, or refinements to policy informed by this research. The latter would also be of benefit to those engaged in transnational marriage irrespective of ethnicity. 

To ensure users have the opportunity to benefit, we will involve them in the research from the outset. At the start of the project, two Local Stakeholder Workshops and a National Workshop will involve representatives from groups 1-3 above. During these workshops, users will have the opportunity to contribute to the design and content of the research, ensuring that topics most relevant to their needs are addressed. A mailing list and other communication strategies will enable ongoing involvement of stakeholders throughout the course of the project. The local and national workshops will be repeated towards the end of the project to disseminate findings and identify possible impacts from the work. 

We plan several further activities to address a wider audience: 

- A COMPAS 'breakfast briefing' event. This popular series of events target Westminster officials and other interested parties on their way to work, and is later podcast. 

- Publication of a concise high-quality briefing publication for non-academic users, to be made available at all project events, and distributed to other users and relevant mailing lists.

- A project webpage hosted by the University of Bristol, and linked to the COMPAS and Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Citizenship websites. The webpage will provide information about the project, updates and downloadable outputs. New items will be advertised on the newfeeds of the two research centres. 

- Press-releases and other web publicity (with the assistance of COMPAS and University of Bristol publicy officers)

- Short research briefings on the COMPAS weekly blog, and as guest blogs for various sites publishing on immigration issues.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>255781</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>QED Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Impact Acceleration Project - Pre-entry language and integration training for Pakistani migrant husbands</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5B647E1-7F2F-4842-8B4A-9269F79A3319</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project still ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c304ca59baf8.24423823-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>QED has contributed staff time and resources to design, set up, run and evaluate the pilot courses in Pakistan</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Input into design and devaluation of two pilot courses in Pakistan for men intending to migrate to the UK as husbands of British Pakistanis.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>KDDI Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:description>Pre-entry integration training for migrant husbands exploratory project</gtr:description><gtr:id>65CD721C-E1A7-43BC-8F2A-1A926213E2DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>in progress</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56daafc04b36f3.55878012-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Venue, staff time (UK and Pakistan)</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Research design</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>COMPAS breakfast briefing</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FBF6F4D4-B4EC-4B52-A92A-91387313C550</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation as part of the COMPAS series of 'Breakfast Briefings' in Whitehall, London.

1. International: The findings around challenges facing migrant husbands led to a collaboration with QED, a UK based charity, on an Impact Acceleration Award project piloting pre-departure language integration training for Pakistani men intending to migrate to the UK as husbands of British Pakistani women. Two courses each with 12 students have been delivered and a facebook group for mutual support established. Student feedback is positive, and further evaluation will be carried out once the men have arrived in the UK. This pilot was also designed to form the basis of funding applications to provide this service in the longer term (QED have already delivered several years of EU funded training for migrant wives).

2. National: The project attracted considerable interest in Whitehall, with invitations to speak to the DCLG, and to a workshop on Pakistani transnationalism involving the DFID, Home Office and Foreign Office in advance of the Casey Review on integration. The Marriage Migration and Integration project report was then cited in the Casey Review as a source of information on Pakistani marriage migration. Some of the Casey Review recommendations echo those from the MMI project report - the need for resources for integration at the point of arrival, and preparation before migration. The Casey Review has been the subject of much public debate since. Policy impact via the Casey review is likely to take longer to become apparent. 

3. Local: Project findings on the labour market engagement and aspirations of spousal migrants were communicated to Bristol City Council as part of a University of Bristol FSSL Migration Research Group informal consultation on plans for guides for new economic migrants to accessing employment and services in the city. As a result, the planned focus and range of language translations was altered to reflect this broader conceptualisation of the target audience.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>89B09A9C-AC6B-44CD-8464-B8E4AAED9861</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544e27c114dd96.22743316</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Among the key findings of this project are:

- Processes of integration are complex, encompassing several dimensions of life: social, structural (e.g. the labour market), cultural, civic and political, and the realm of identity. Processes within these domains can enhance each other and proceed together, as when a newly arrived migrant spouse finds employment and develops social networks with colleagues. But they can also be in tension, for example, if long working hours in low-wage employment leave little time to make new social networks or engage in civic activity (as for some Pakistani migrant husbands who participated in the research). Processes of integration in the various domains are also not always clearly connected. The issue of identity in particular appeared separate from other aspects of integration among our participants. Hence, when migrant spouses did not develop a British identity, this did not appear as an impediment to broader processes of integration. For the British born/raised Indian Sikh and Pakistani Muslim spouses interviewed, we found no correlation between a transnational marriage and strength of British identity. Among some British respondents, we found a 'paradox of integration' (not related to transnational marriage) in which their social and political engagement meant greater awareness of discrimination and issues of foreign policy, sometimes leading to political disillusionment and/or questioning the significance of Britishness. As this suggests, processes of engagement and identity do not simply increase over time but can also decrease.

- There are variations in patterns of engagement by gender and ethnic group, so that while migrant husbands had high levels of paid employment, rates of employment are lower for migrant wives, particularly amongst Pakistani Muslims. Some findings challenge common assumptions about relationships between transnational marriage and integration. For some British Pakistani women, for example, rather than a transnational marriage being a sign of traditionalism or creating more patriarchal domestic relationships, marriage to a migrant enhanced their autonomy. Whilst British families often expected that a wife from the subcontinent would have more traditional expectations of gender roles, and rates of extended family living were higher among migrant wife couples, some migrant wives had high levels of education and strong aspirations around work and careers. Whether and how quickly these aspirations were fulfilled depended on a range of factors including not just familial support, but also matters of policy and local opportunities.

- Patterns of integration vary across the life course. For both migrant and non-migrant participants, marriage and childrearing is a time of life when social networks tend to focus around the family. Marriage migrants enter this stage of life at the same time as entering a new country (with attendant loss of social networks), with the effect of amplifying this focus on the family. These early patterns of integration are not, however, set in stone, and can change later in life. 

- At all stages, the opportunities presented by the local environment, job markets, and policy frameworks are crucial effectors of patterns of integration. This two-way process of integration, involving not just the characteristics of the migrant, but also the society into which they arrive, is shared with other forms of migration. In comparison with many other categories of migrants, spousal migrants have an important potential advantage in the form of their relationships with their British partner and in-laws, who can provide information, contacts and support for the new arrival. Families vary, however, in their knowledge and resources and in the expectations they may have of their new member.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings suggest the following uses for policy and service providers:

? There is a clear need for information and signposting for arriving spouses. Receiving families initially fulfil this role, but have varying knowledge, resources and expectations. 

? Challenges faced by migrant husbands are less widely recognised than those affecting migrant wives, forming a gap in service provision.

? Integration interventions for migrant spouses should take account of issues of gender and life-course. The report suggests four phases of opportunity for interventions:
 
o Pre-migration - practical information about life in the UK could be offered with language training. 

o Arrival - often a window of opportunity before migrants find work and/or have children for provision of information, training and other opportunities.

o Childrearing - often a period of time pressures from work and caring. Space for encouraging and supporting engagement could still be found in: community groups, schools, and workplaces.

o Later in life - initial patterns of integration are not set in stone, with room for initiatives targeting those at later life stages. 

? Perceptions of equality are a prerequisite for integration, emphasising the value to these groups of action to address stereotypes and build understanding.
