As happened in Ramsey in June, we invited local groups and organisations, such as the NFU, Natural England, The Great Fen Project and Angling Trust, and general public for an evening of convivial local storytelling, food and drink. 10 storytellers shared their experiences of water management and plans for the future as climate change is a growing concern. There was the opportunity to ask questions and sharing experiences from the audience, while also learning about how Peterborough and the Fenlands can help each other in the future.
The evening of entertainment took the form of a mock court room, where members of the community shared stories about water usage, the flood/drought nexus and the future of the Fens. Involving an advisory jury made up of young people, the event was designed for all of the community.
As part of the event, we also had a communal meal, which was made with locally sourced produce.
Court-artists, a musician, a caricaturist, a poetic judge and some good food promise made this a lively and fun-filled evening of community, music, stories and laughter. 
Feedback was very positive and this has led to further discussions about possible additional work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfe7aa472598.69100029</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://dryproject.co.uk/events/think-water-storytelling-for-the-future-of-peterborough-and-the-fens/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'ASPECT: Storytelling, Technology and Public Engagement with Climate Change'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6339C97D-E15D-4D2E-80EB-D101612325C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited presentation to members of the Cabinet Office, Whitehall, February 2013

During the conference, we proposed a 'performative screening' of stories, dialogues and songs generated for and by our local stakeholders to reflect on the potential of a utopian participatory approach for decision-making.
During our public engagement activities, language has been identified as one of the main concerns, especially with regard to the impenetrable way in which policymakers and scientists often communicate. Hence we suggested multiple-narrative approaches in various languages to facilitate a utopian universal understanding: verbal/visual, factual/fictional or poetic, English/ other languages. This 'performative screening' was structured in three phases (a dialogue in two different languages, a screening of stories, the playing of a song as part of the storytelling process) to explore the potential re-use of a traditional form of performative orality from Sardinia ('La Rasgioni' or ' The Reasons') that aims to solve dilemmas and disputes within the community, by reconciling conflicting interests in a way that builds resilience and reinforces community cohesion.
Feedback was very positive and this has further increased the visibility of the work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfe9fb4418b8.91419284</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/newsevents/events/calendar/utopia-connected-communities-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Speaker (Bournemouth University)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3416C7A4-7ADB-40F2-A130-1B591FF0F178</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk was part of the 'Communicating the Immediacy of Climate Change' Workshop at Bournemouth Media School and reported on the work of Project Aspect.

We invited general public and local stakeholders to a forum for community public storytelling as a way of exploring dilemmas and conflicts about water governance. The action was presented as a mock court, presided over by a community elder with other community members playing the part of the jury. In turn, various stakeholders were invited to tell their stories and could be questioned for clarification by either the jury or the general public, who were gathered as the audience. After all the stories were told, everyone (judge, jury, witnesses and general public) retired to enjoy a communal meal, before returning to the hall, where the jury delivered its verdict, for which the judge then provided an interpretation, one that combines vernacular wisdom with a healthy disregard for traditional power structures, to share a resolution that unites, rather than divides the community. Overall the evaluation was positive with many of the participants commenting on the project's success in fostering open discussion around complex, and potentially divisive issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfe6dcebad62.80846353</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://dryproject.co.uk/events/theres-something-in-the-water-the-reasons-stories-about-water-usage-drought-and-the-future-of-the-fens/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Mess to Deal with Mess&quot;, Research Seminar for Culture and Media Analysis Research Group, Loughborough University.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB818703-C428-4A05-89FE-61C7310D4461</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a seminar presented to academic colleagues and PGRs from the social science faculty in the university.
