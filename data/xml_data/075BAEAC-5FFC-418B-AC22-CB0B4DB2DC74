The large displacement on this portion of the subduction zone was unexpected by earthquake scientists and produced a devastating tsunami that took over 23,000 lives and caused massive damage along the northeast coast of Honshu. The primary science objective of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 343 is to understand the physical mechanisms of large slip earthquakes, which at present, is poorly understood. It is a subject of great societal relevance regarding the evaluation of severe shaking and large tsunamis from future earthquakes originating at subduction zones.

Between 1 April and 24 May 2012 the Expedition will be offshore Japan drilling, coring, logging and deploying borehole observatories from the R/V Chikyu. This project will use a combination of physical properties data collected in situ downhole and measurements on recovered core to: help precisely locate the fault zone, characterise the formations encountered, and investigate the regional stress regime. Hence, it will directly contribute to the major objectives set out by this expedition.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
Interpreting downhole log responses in terms of physical characteristics is important in a range of applications. While the majority of this work takes places in the search for hydrocarbons, it is equally applicable in the field of formation characterization and stress field research. Downhole measurements are at the forefront of technology and this is a rapidly developing area for a number of major companies that provide the tools to all these industries. The IODP expeditions allow tools to be used for scientific purposes and also concentrate on data interpretation in innovative ways that are not necessarily considered by industry, who are using these tools in a very focused manner. This work aims to use downhole logging and core petrophysical data to characterize a major fault zone associated to an active subduction zone, and contribute to one of the main IODP expedition aims of improving our understanding of earthquake mechanics. Thus scientists working across a range of disciplines, from seismology to microbiology will benefit from the techniques used here. This in turn may impact policy makers as well as the public and private sectors. The overall work here is highly relevant to society in that one of its main aims is to better understand a major natural hazard.

How will they benefit from this research?
This research will benefit the UK community through the development of a researcher who will be able to play a key role in the country's energy and environment work, using advanced techniques to better understand the Earth's subsurface and how it impacts society. Equally, the techniques used will be seen to be applicable by others working in industry towards different objectives and will be adopted as appropriate. Our understanding of earthquake mechanics is important even in a country that has relatively little earthquake activity since many major installations - oil rigs and power stations - may be threatened by such intermittent activity.

What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research?
We will publicise the results of this small grant through a variety of measures. Through publication in peer-reviewed journals, magazines (such as Planet Earth), websites, and press releases. We will present our work at conferences and at public meetings, and disseminate our work through our outreach program to schools and through university lectures. LWD techniques used and the physical property data collected will be increasingly important in the hydrocarbon industry , particularly subtle plays and smaller hydrocarbon fields in the mature field of the North Sea UK sector. We have a track record of working with industry, therefore there are potential direct economic benefits of this research project which will maintain the UK's position as a major player in high-technology instrumentation of boreholes and will contribute to a regional strength in the East Midlands (Weatherford UK Ltd, Geotek and the University of Leicester).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7641</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>58D33E30-0291-498F-9CEC-3FB40B5206C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stress state in the largest displacement area of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science (New York, N.Y.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8598d94f3340085be4902d35c69c2138"><gtr:id>8598d94f3340085be4902d35c69c2138</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lin W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0036-8075</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0700701c46d33</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/K00123X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE94F009-26A1-4E5B-B0B3-722A355F282C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geohazards</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9C0F9DC0-329C-4C09-B439-E4335EA8F916</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Properties Of Earth Materials</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>401A9A9F-83DF-48FD-B108-C4CC7FB7572C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tectonic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
