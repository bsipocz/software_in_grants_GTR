The National Physical Laboratory will be joining as partners and will advise on technical aspects as well as assisting with overall management and appraisal.The exhibition consists of original paintings and 3D soundscape supported by posters explaining the basic physical concepts and the way in which researchers are addressing the scientific and environmental problems. SOUND has already been shown at five major centres in Britain, namely the Scottish Parliament, Dynamic Earth Edinburgh, Glasgow Science Centre, Centre For Contemporary Arts Glasgow and the London Metropolitan University; it will shortly show at the Waterfront and Sonic Arts Research Centre in Belfast. Attendance has already exceeded the target number by a factor of more than three. In the proposed new programme the exhibition will be further developed by adding new paintings and enhansing the soundscape in order to extend scope of the topics covered and the range of venues where the exhibition can be shown. New venues will be sought both in the UK and abroad with emphasis on large public spaces of international significance which will attract media coverage. Firm offers have already been received to show the exhibition at the prestigeous Venkatappa Gallery in the centre of Bangalore and also at the Palace of Culture in Minsk where there will be an associated programme on national television about the project. Interest has also been expressed by the Natural History Museum in South Kensington and the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock . In addition, we plan to develop a scaled-down version of the exhibition that can be shown simultaneously in smaller venues. For example, offers have already been received to show at the Round Foundry Media Centre in Leeds and Sensation in Dundee.Alongside the exhibitions will be a series of talks to public and school meetings arranged with the assistance of Scifun (Edinburgh University) and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>61251</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F022239/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B148AA4C-48F9-4B18-90F6-641750F725A1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Acoustics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
