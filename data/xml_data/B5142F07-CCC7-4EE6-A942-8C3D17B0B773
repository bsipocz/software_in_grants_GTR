Network</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L007266/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This network will take the relatively new field of live coding research to its next development stage and strengthen the UK's position as one of the leading countries in this field. It will bring together researchers from a wide variety of disciplines to explore how live coding can enrich technological engagement in wider culture. 

Live coding is a new approach to creative expression using computers. In live coding, the innards of software are exposed and rewired through live, direct, and exploratory use of custom made programming languages. Practitioners perform on stage by writing code that generates the audiovisual work; it is a form of real-time notating or scoring music, visuals, dance or robotics. The screen is projected, enabling the audience to follow the development of the code. Since the computer interprets the code live, every edit to the code is immediately reflected in the musical or visual end result.

Live coding has a strong pedagogical and performance element, and has proven to be applicable right across the arts, research, and industry. Interest in live coding is growing across science, technology and engineering: the digital arts are uniquely placed in the field of technological innovation, as they place the human experience of programming at the core of technological interaction. Live coding is a field where technological development is arts-led, and where computer languages are seen as rich environments for creative expression. 

This trans-disciplinary network will bring key researchers and practitioners from diverse disciplines together with the aim of enabling dialogue and research collaboration across academy and industry. The network will serve as a hub for activities in research, development, and education; activities will take place internationally, and be strongly centred within the UK research landscape. Although the network is UK based, it includes leading international researchers in the field, and it will foster for strong international outreach and industry connections, that will support and maintain the UKs leading role as the centre of live coding research and practice.

The network will explore themes of live coding in the arts, computing in education, and cultural engagement. This will be investigated through three workshops, one international conference, and diverse publications. Wider cultural impact will be achieved through industry events, musical performances, media engagement, online fora, software releases, and public workshops. The network will disseminate its research to other researchers and the general public through a strong, open access web-presence.

The past ten years have seen many exciting developments in live coding, which has matured into an established approach in the digital arts, visible across published literature (including a forthcoming Computer Music Journal special issue), academic conferences, digital arts festivals, and in national and international media. Working with the fundamental premise that everybody can program computers, provided that the goals are interesting and the right tools are available, live coding is uniquely placed to bridge relationships across the educational, academic and industry sectors, and contribute to the recent emphasis on programming in the national curriculum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Live coding is attracting increasing interest from diverse fields, due to issues around technology, culture, language and creativity that it makes visible. Below, we list the specific Impact Areas (IAs) that will benefit from this research network.

IA1: Cultural and creative industries
Programming is common across the cultural and creative industries, including computer games (see IA3), but also areas such as film animation, architecture, music technology, interactive design and other digital arts practice. By engaging with creative agencies, including project partners Field, academia and industry involve in a bidirectional relationship where both can learn from each other's processes (e.g. http://tinyurl.com/br47jym) by exchanging new technologies and methods. This network will establish strong links between industry and academia through planned activities and online channels that will outlast the project's lifetime.

IA2: Education
Computer programming is now a national priority in government policy and educational curricula (see for example http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16493929). Live coding is of growing interest to this area, with project partner Blackwell working with the Raspberry PI foundation to introduce live coding in schools. Professor Mark Guzdial (recipient of IEEE teaching award for computing education) has demonstrated dramatic impacts on gender balance in higher education, and has publicly stated that live coding in computer science lectures is &amp;quot;best practice&amp;quot;.

IA3: Computer Games
Live coding applies to computer games not only to exploratory game design, but the inclusion of programmable behaviour as part of end-user game mechanics. Project partner Griffiths (FoAM) is actively carrying out research into in-game programming languages, with projected impact on the computer games industry, but also the related field of &amp;quot;serious games,&amp;quot; where educational topics are explored through playful interfaces. Live coding allows for changing a game in real-time, useful when considering the application domains of serious games (such as key-hole surgery and more). 

IA4: Music and Performance Technology
The growth of live coding has benefitted by the thirst for new technology in musical culture, to find new sounds and means of expression. Music technology research is well developed, through academic conferences such as New Interfaces for Musical Expression, and through strong links to a thriving music technology industry. This network will create contexts where live coding is exposed directly to musicians and artists in other performance arts.

IA5: Software engineering
Software engineers have operated with a concept of interactive programming for a while, but in practice this has largely been limited to the debugging of already written code. Live coding brings this practice into a new light, opening up programming as a collaborative activity, enabling groups of programmers to work on running code together. It thus adds a new tool to the research field and practice of Extreme Programming (where two or more programmers collaborate).

IA6: Cognitive neuroscience
The neurological substrates of language is a research interest for many cognitive neuroscientists, such as project partner Benn. Due to the tightly controlled conditions required for experimental methods, such research often focusses on the use of formal language, e.g., mathematics. Live coding is exciting for this field as an example of language use in live, social and creative situations, yet more readily observable than natural language.

IA7: Wider culture
Technology is invading our lives through smartphone apps, on-line social networks and the move towards ubiquitous computing. Live coding presents technology as open, manipulable, and social. The importance of this is recognised by cultural researchers such as the Participatory IT group in Aarhus, who are now investigating participatory design of programming languages.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27814</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Solo and Collaborative performance using my free/open source Tidal live coding environment.

The conference took take place at the University of Sussex in June, 2016. This biennial conference brought together people working with live interfaces in the performing arts, including music, the visual arts, dance, puppetry, robotics or games. The conference scope was highly interdisciplinary but with a focus on interface technologies of expression in the area of performance. Topics of liveness, immediacy, presence (and tele-presence), mediation, collaboration and timing or flow were engaged with and questioned in order to gain a deeper understanding of the role contemporary media technologies play in human expression.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c67c3e4f6432.14637086</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.liveinterfaces.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sonic Pattern and the textility of code</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F98D5542-1E8D-425B-ACFB-EA4A18C5BFF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A collaboration between Alex McLean and Karen Gaskill (director of the Innovation Programme

We have run four symposia, various workshops, concerts and an international conference. Most importantly, we have managed to consolidate a large group of international researchers from diverse disciplines (e.g., music, art, computing, psychology, education) that are now connected through stronger ties by means of diverse media platforms.

Diverse participants in the LCRN activities have established their own research projects as a result of the network. Thanks to high-profile research and media presence, the public has become strongly aware of live coding as a method for artistic performance, suffice to mention examples from this week (February 29th, 2016) where Dr Alex McLean's live coding activities are featured in The Wire Magazine (www.thewire.co.uk) and Dr Sam Aaron is interviewed on BBC about the Sonic Pi live coding language, which runs on the popular Raspberry Pi computer. We are happy to witness that the concept of &amp;quot;Algorave&amp;quot; as a distinct music genre is gaining a place in public consciousness. 

Participants in the network have been highly active in organising public events: talks, residencies, workshops, performances, concerts, hackathons. These events have been impactful in that they engage the public and we have seen a considerable increase in live coding activities during the two years that we've run the network. The term &amp;quot;live coding&amp;quot; is increasingly being used in the context of IT education, and young people are engaging with this field through diverse means, for example live coding events within the Minecraft virtual world.

We are happy to have observed an interest in live coding from hearing and visually impaired people. At our first symposium event in Brighton, a profoundly deaf musician gave their first performance by means of live coding. This person reports that seeing the code helps him to understand other people's music and perform his own.

Our own (McLean and Magnusson's) live coding environments, Tidal, ixi lang and the Threnoscope, have now established userbases. Several people have used this software as platforms for research, and thousands of people are using it to make music including many performances and several album releases.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4B4DB4FA-3952-46A5-BBEE-FD15AF9D9040</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463e108cb34d2.09277774</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Live Coding Research Network was a two year network project that served in consolidating key international researchers and practitioners in the area of live coding. 

Our aim was to develop an interdisciplinary field of research and practice, which includes researchers from ethnography, education, human-computer interaction, psychology, as well as music and the performing arts.

We have been successful in running diverse events over the two years, such as symposia on embodiment, artistic interdisciplinary collaboration and education. We have run diverse workshops for the general public, for people of all age and educational backgrounds. The research network culminated in the running of the first International Conference on Live Coding in Leeds, in summer 2015. This conference will take place on a yearly basis and will happen in Hamilton, Canada, in the autumn of 2016. We have taken efforts to work towards diversity in our events, for example by establishing a code of conduct for attendees, involving a range of people in organising events and supporting a live coding workshop by the Yorkshire Sound Women's Network.

The project was instrumental in setting the context for a co-authored MIT Press published book on live coding, as well as a bespoke journal issue on live coding with the International Journal for Performance Arts and Digital Media. It has also contributed to several chapters in the Oxford Handbook in Algorithmic Music.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have set up a website to disseminate our activities. We also run a more wide reaching TOPLAP website (www.toplap.org) and various Twitter accounts that disseminate live coding research. Our software is all open source and freely available on Github. The proceedings of the International Conference on Live Coding are published as open access.

These outputs, together with the workshops and symposia, have been of benefit to actors within the cultural and creative industries, education, computer games, music and performance technology, software engineering, cognitive neuroscience and the wider culture. The network has had a strong interdisciplinary focus and the activities and outputs have been kept open and accessible to all.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F245995D-C516-4334-94CA-A8F8D4A34D13</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463e0c5692457.55852693</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2015/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The development of Live Coding as an academic research network with close ties to the TOPLAP network of practitioners</gtr:description><gtr:id>4281D8C8-EC05-4D73-A134-67CBBD0C3B16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing connections between developers, artists, researchers and other practitioners interested in live coding.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463b1ac21e818.39149175</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Live coding research development</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://toplap.org</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The Threnoscope system implements a live coding mini-language for drone-based microtonal composition. It is a system built in SuperCollider and makes use its powerful audio server to run complex synth instances that can be controlled through the interface modalities. The design goal was to create a helpful graphical representation of the sonic texture in microtonal drone music. The system notates selected features of the drones, such as the spatial location, pitch, amplitude, filtering, and other parameters in a two dimensional score. Instead of the traditional linear score, the Threnoscope is circular, where drones (or the notes) circumnavigate a multichannel pitch space. The piece is composed for multichannel surround where the idea is to visualise the location of sound in space</gtr:description><gtr:id>4AB41E6F-54DA-4FDF-9748-F584649D140F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The software has been used in performances.
