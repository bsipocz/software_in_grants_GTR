Studies show that, relative to the general population, anxious / depressed individuals tend to automatically notice negative rather than positive information (attentional bias), and also show this negative tendency when interpreting ambiguous scenarios (Interpretation bias). In contrast, elated individuals show an opposing pattern. To date however, research has primarily examined one bias in isolation to the other, so little is currently known about the potential relationship between them, and how they may also interact with mood. The first study will address this omission, by examining whether attentional and interpretive biases work together or independently in members of the general population. The results will inform current theoretical models regarding bias operation in those with some vulnerability towards mood disorders and those without. It will also inform study two, which aims to optimise Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM): a training programme which ameliorates biases in a positive direction. If it is found the biases work together, provision of either Interpretive or attentional training is expected to be beneficial. If however they are found to work independently, optimising CBM towards the dominant bias will be beneficial.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is anticipated to advance theoretical knowledge regarding the cognitive processes involved in attentional and interpretive biases associated with anxiety, and propagate further research regarding the most efficacious presentation of Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) treatment programmes. The CBM paradigm is currently receiving a plethora of research attention, both nationally and internationally, some of which is investigating the efficacy of computerised CBM programmes, which have the potential for users to access at their convenience - for example, on their home computer: a cost effective solution in the treatment of anxiety. In contrast to the currently favoured 'talking therapies' such as CBT, CBM utilises implicit, unconscious processes, and thus may render itself more suitable to anxious individuals with conditions such as stuttering and aphasia. Although future research is required to investigate this fully, in the long term CBM may have the potential for wide application in the treatment of anxiety, particularly in health service settings, where cost effectiveness is a priority. It is therefore anticipated that the proposed research will directly underpin future CBM treatment designs, which will in turn, indirectly, be of benefit to any organisation with a requirement to provide cost effective anxiety treatment packages to a wide audience, including both national and international organisations. Within the UK, this may include public health service providers - the NHS and private sector, third party organisations, such as charities. Providing a potentially efficacious, easily accessible, cost effective solution to health care providers in the treatment of anxiety has clear additional benefits to society at large. Directly, many work hours are lost within the UK each year to sufferers of anxiety conditions. Indirectly the family and friends of those with anxiety disorders are also at increased risk of experiencing some kind of mental health difficulty. Thus in the long term and indirectly, CBM has the potential to assist in the reduction of long term health costs, improving the mental wellbeing of the nation, and reducing man hours lost at work.

Staff working on this project will develop a range of competencies which could be applied to other work sectors, including use of IT and advanced software, presenting to seminar groups and conferences, journal article writing, working with the general public as well as skills in planning and running a comprehensive project. They will also be well versed in CBM methodologies, which, as the methodology develops, will become increasingly applicable in contexts outside the laboratory.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78561</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Study 1 examined the relationship of each bias with social anxiety, and whether this differs depending on how threatening the context is. 

161 participants from a normal academic population. All participants' baseline depression, state and trait anxiety levels and degree of social anxiety using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer &amp;amp; Brown, 1996), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg &amp;amp; Jacobs, 1983), Brief Fear Of Negative Evaluations (BFNE: Leary, 1983), The Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN: Connor, Davidson, Churchill, Sherwood, Weisler &amp;amp; Foa, 2000) and The Attentional Control Scale (ACS: Derryberry &amp;amp; Reed, 2002).



Participants were engaged in a socially non-threatening activity, listening to music/birdsong. Depression, anxiety, social anxiety and attentional control were then measured, then compared with the baseline measures of the bias tests. 

Participants were next prepared to take part in a socially threatening, giving a public speech. The depression and social anxiety measures are all done again, attentional bias test and interpretive bias test before they have the speech. Once final measures are completed, participants will be debriefed (they will not do the stress task at all).



Experimental modification of cognitive bias represents a demonstrably powerful tool for discovering the aetiological role of the established biases in relation to each other and affect. Moreover, in understanding more precisely how these cognitive processes operate in the common affective disorders, they can potentially be more readily manipulated in clinical intervention.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6C2D3925-2E2C-4DA1-8BF1-4368AFFFA7CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None
