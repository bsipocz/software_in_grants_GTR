This will include support for translating research into usable products and procedures. In the process, networks will become established that deliver more effective sharing of knowledge. These objectives are made possible by the deployment of Dr Tristram Riley-Smith who brings extensive experience of National Security policy and practice, at a senior level.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Outputs will include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>strengthened networks between National Security stakeholders and academics&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>insights into the barriers to effective engagement, and recommendations for overcoming these&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the completion of work-streams that test and explore new ways of delivering research outputs to end-users in the National Security arena.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This should bring long-term value to the UK?s research base, establishing networks between government and academia that will inform and enrich research on themes related to the Global Uncertainties programme. This should also enhance the work of National Security policy-makers and practitioners, supporting their efforts to safeguard the security of our citizens (and the wider world) by improving their access to new knowledge and capabilities.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who? Beneficiaries can be categorised under three broad headings (recognising that some of these will derive direct and early benefit from our project, eg through participating in workshops and extracting value from new communities of interest):

- National Security stakeholders, including:
 o Security and Intelligence practitioners (inc police &amp;amp; armed services)
 o Home Office and MOD policy-makers
 o Department for Transport policy-makers and advisers
 o Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure
 o Office of Cyber-Security and Information Assurance
 o Private sector operators of the Critical National Infrastructure.

- The whole range of researchers supported through the Research Councils, whose research contributes to National Security, as well as those - such as Cambridge's Centre for Business Research - involved in exploring ways of extracting benefit from research and innovation.

 - Industry and Financial Sector
 o Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (eg those spun out of universities)
 o Seedcorn, Venture Capital and Private Equity funds supporting National Security sector.

Citizens of the UK, and the world beyond, will benefit indirectly from any improvement in the contribution that research makes to people's security. The British economy could benefit from growth and exports deriving from a flourishing SME sector serving National Security customers; and British companies benefit from enhanced security measures - such as cyber-security - protecting their staff and assets (including, notably, Intellectual Property).

How will they benefit from this research? 

- National Security stakeholders will benefit through gaining access to the tools, techniques, knowledge and understanding that derive from enhanced engagement with researchers in the UK

- Academics benefit from seeing enhanced impact deriving from their research; with the chance, in some cases, for wealth to be generated through the commercialisation of their intellectual property

- Industry and the Financial sector benefit with new markets being developed and with innovation being de-risked through improved communication between entrepreneurs and National Security stakeholders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27139</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Airey Neave Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>National Security Fellowships</gtr:description><gtr:id>76598977-1967-4957-B26A-8B7F7A710A7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professional development and improved network for contacts with researchers for the government stakeholders who participated.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b9d9afbcb9d9afd0-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Airey Neave Trust provided some financial support to develop the programme.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Building on pilot carried out during the Fellowship, and with additional funding from the The Airey Neave Trust, further rounds of Fellowships have been commissioned.

Dr Riley-Smith successfully bid to become the External Champion to the Global Uncertainties Programme - a three-year appointment that began in April 2013. In this capacity he has been applying the learning from his Fellowship in fulfilling the Champion's mission of supporting delivery of impact from research. He has communicated this learning in presentations to c 40 Research Institutions in a year; he has also established contact with over 40 stakeholder organisations (in Government, Industry and Civil Society). In addition to running the National Security Schemes (qv), he has undertaken a triage of the 1,100 projects in the GU portfolio and is now operating an &amp;quot;Enhanced Impact Scheme&amp;quot; and an &amp;quot;Academic RISC Market-Place&amp;quot; aimed at extracting value from the programme by linking researchers to stakeholders; he has also organised an academic placement into the National Crime Agency to help this new government agency identify its requirements for social and behavioural science, and he is arranging for an academic researcher to support HMG's analysis and understanding of the value of c 200 cyber-security projects within the GU Programme. The insights and conclusions reached in the course of the 2012 Fellowship have made a substantive contribution to this work.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0BC7C177-4ED7-41C3-931B-2297BE230CD1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463d7a97e2a90.88068874</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Trial the Feasibility of a National Security Data Release Scheme

The pilot considered requirements for releasing for research purposes a candidate data-set. Data-owners reviewed legal, ethical, security and operational issues; academic researchers reviewed the intellectual, technical and logistical challenges. The pilot found that in principle, and probably in practice, sensitive NS data can be released for research, where this supports the statutory function of the data-owners.



2. Improve Access to Information on the Research-Base

With the help of the Research Councils, we put in place - in August 2012 - arrangements to support NS stakeholder inquiries into on-going research, using the Research Outcomes System. This was communicated to relevant teams in six Government Departments and Agencies, but none made use of the facilities. Feedback gathered in November suggested that either there were established workarounds to perceived obstacles (e.g. use of existing, informal networks) and/or that this was not regarded as a sufficiently high priority to justify action. With the help of RCUK, we also raised awareness among stakeholders of the Gateway to Research project.



3. Issue Guidelines for IP/IPR

A consultation exercise conducted with National Security stakeholders revealed a growing interest in understanding IP/IPR issues, although departments are moving along parallel tracks and at different speeds. A key conclusion is that NS Departments must develop the capacity to understand complex IP issues (e.g. making the right choice from a range of IPR options available; and resolving tensions between national prosperity, product delivery and national security).



4. Trial a Knowledge Exchange Scheme

A pilot National Security Fellowship Scheme ran with three officials from departments with interest in cyber-security issues meeting over 40 academics from 13 different academic institutions. The officials identified four major themes: Threats, Vulnerabilities &amp;amp; Mitigations; the Nature of the Cyber World; the Partnership between Academic Research, Government &amp;amp; Industry; and the Economics, Management &amp;amp; Communication of Cyber-Security. Feedback afterwards produced high scores from the Fellows in terms of impact on their attitude to engagement with academic research, with the prospect for follow-up research; they are communicating what they learnt through internal blogs, briefing colleagues and written reports. 



5. Explore Options for a National Security Portal for Research Proposals

This pilot monitored progress with an innovative call by the Centre for Defence Enterprise (CDE). The number of academic researchers that applied under this call was relatively small. This problem could be significantly overcome if we could construct more effective channels for researchers to receive requirements, supporting processes like CDE's with the idea of an Academic RISC (the Security and Resilience Industry Suppliers' Community).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Knowledge exchange pilots tested during the Fellowship have generated practical insights that have already been of value in establishing new approaches to knowledge exchange within government.
