Social innovation involves new ideas for products, services and ways of working that meet unmet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborations. Austerity can accelerate social innovation in cities, but may also push it in particular directions, with significant, but little understood, implications for urban politics and governance. Social innovation involves three essential components: generating financial resources, harnessing social energy, and meeting social needs. We will address our aim by pursing three OBJECTIVES:

1) We will generate new knowledge of the relationship between social innovation and urban politics and governance in European cities, through research on three essential components of social innovation: generating financial resources, harnessing social energy and meeting material needs.

2) We will investigate the impact of contrasting experiences of austerity on the urban politics and governance of social innovation using a comparative methodology three cities: Athens, Berlin and Newcastle.

3) We will promote urban social innovation in Europe through the sharing and development of knowledge, experience and practice between cities among social innovators, urban policy-makers, community practitioners and social activists, via a new international Urban Social Innovation Network (USIN).

GENERATING RESOURCES: ALTERNATIVE FINANCE. It is often difficult to raise funds for social innovation from conventional commercial sources, and in austerity public sector funding is limited. Alternative finance, including crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, and impact investing, offers social innovators the opportunity to generate financial resources that would otherwise be unavailable. Moreover, alternative finance is also a form of social innovation in its own right.

HARNESSING ENERGY: GRASSROOTS MOBILISATION. Social innovation is 'achieved through the activism, energy and creativity of social groups, organisations, communities and individuals' (Call text). Social energy involves dynamic interactions that create capacities to act beyond the sum of their parts. It is intense in grassroots protest movements, notably those responding to austerity. However the energy of grassroots mobilisations can quickly dissipate once the immediate moment of protest has passed.

MEETING NEEDS: COMMUNITY PROVISIONING. A key goal of social innovation is to meet social needs that are not being adequately met through conventional private or public provision. Material needs for food, energy, housing and transport are particularly acute in austerity, but so too are cultural needs for hope, inspiration, education and caring. Social innovation to meet needs through community provisioning generates new 'patterns of care and responsibility'.

In each city we will investigate how alternative finance, grassroots mobilisation and community provisioning cotribute to social innovation in austerity. We will examine how such social innovations affect urban politics and governance by disrupting existing power relations and channels of legitimacy and accountability, creating new forms of citizenship, challenging traditional institutions and ways of working, and generating competition for public services. It is important to understand the impact of social innovation on urban politics and governance to ensure the effective contribution of social innovation to future urban transformation.

Throughout the research we will work closely with local practitioners, activists and policy-makers in each city. We will establish an Urban Social Innovation Network through which they will be able to meet, share ideas and experiences, and exchange knowledge with each other and with the research team and other experts. Our research will benefit social innovators, community organisations, city governments as well as other researchers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>BENEFICIARIES OF THE RESEARCH

Three beneficiary groups have been identified, with the intention to maximise the reach of the impact, while also taking a focused approach in assessing its significance. The reach of the impact is therefore anticipated to include:

1. Social innovators in cities under austerity including alternative financiers, grassroots mobilising community organisations and campaign groups and alternative community providers. Through its participatory impact approach, the project will bring together the stakeholders from the three cities, facilitating their mutual learning, interaction and potential direct co-operation.

2. City councils and municipal state authorities. Taking into account the significantly diverse political landscape and subsequent austerity policies in the three cities, local authorities in the three cities will benefit significantly (a) from interaction with grassroots/ alternative community providers in their own cities and (b) from juxtaposition with policies and interaction with policy-makers in the other two cities.

3. The general urban public in cities faced with austerity policies. The project's explicitly outward-facing impact and dissemination strategy, including its Online Toolkit for Urban Social Innovation and public exhibition of findings will allow the general public in all three cities a unique and in-depth insight into social innovation under austerity in the other two urban settings.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

For the first cluster of beneficiaries, the significance of the project impact will be assessed by analysing enhancement to the practices of social innovation as an effect of the uptake and use of the project's Online Toolkit for Urban Social Innovation, as well as through the utilisation of the Urban Social Innovation Network (USIN). Feedback through local and cross-city workshops will be gathered, forming part of the development process for the Online Toolkit and fermenting the establishment of the USIN (see also Pathways to Impact).

The impact amongst local urban authorities (including city councils and municipal state) will be understood and measured through their level of engagement to the USIN and through the level of their implementation of key project findings on social innovation in local policy. It is anticipated that such implementation will have a &amp;quot;knock-on&amp;quot; effect on austerity-related local and urban policies in cities across Europe. 

Finally, the two-fold impact-focused outcomes of the project (the Online Toolkit and USIN) will allow extremely significant and unprecedented interaction and co-operation between the project's stakeholder and beneficiary groups: at a time when local authorities are increasingly reliant on the creativity and resilience of local community groups and organisations, as social innovation becomes key in the provision of public services previously managed and provided by the central state, the project's potential for impact is immense. Bringing together these key beneficiaries and stakeholders will allow for impact by the way in which community organisations act, in their understanding of cross-border austerity policies and their effects, consequently impacting upon public understanding and debate on social innovation under austerity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>638085</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6ACD2413-A1A4-454F-A49C-37F1E6905DB3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The micropolitics of urban social innovation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/899909c60260d709a1d2a79269c53078"><gtr:id>899909c60260d709a1d2a79269c53078</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Painter J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b136d54f13.16219806</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7BEC96DC-68CC-4898-A7EB-42521082DBD8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparative Urbanism of Social Innovation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/899909c60260d709a1d2a79269c53078"><gtr:id>899909c60260d709a1d2a79269c53078</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Painter J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6af1e11d705.61314857</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1DD06834-3A6E-4B62-B635-C095DFCD401B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Urban social innovation in austerity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/899909c60260d709a1d2a79269c53078"><gtr:id>899909c60260d709a1d2a79269c53078</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Painter J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b27a90d1d8.42943018</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N005988/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>250B44D8-B3A0-486E-B201-E6F45B9C3DD7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
