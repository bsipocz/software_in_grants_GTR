research</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/P006698/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Ocean acidification (OA) is a relatively newly described process that refers to major changes to the ocean's chemistry, mainly caused by ocean uptake of human produced emissions of CO2 to the atmospheric. OA poses substantial risks to all marine ecosystems through the impacts on the physiology, behaviour, and population dynamics of individual species. 

OA research has grown substantially over the last 5 years with investigations across many disciplines. The complexity of experiments and approaches has also grown as scientists have aimed at a better understanding of future impacts for ecosystems and society. Initially experiments were simple and short term and only addressed effects of OA. However, other ocean stressors act at the same time as OA, such as ocean warming and deoxygenation and sea level rise. Now investigations are more complex looking at effects from multiple stressors over longer time scales, some manipulate whole ecosystems, others look at adaptation potential, others investigate similar events in the geological record, others look at the potential socio economic consequences while global and regional modelling project what the ocean chemistry will be like in the future under different CO2 emissions scenarios.

The product of these wide ranging studies published in the scientific literature is an increasing awareness that there is a broad variety of sensitivities and often complex responses amongst organisms but that overall marine ecosystems are highly likely to change in the future. The degree of change will depend on society's actions to reduce CO2 emissions. Such actions are discussed and negotiated at the UNFCCC COPs. It is therefore important that that the effects of CO2 emissions on the ocean, its ecosystems and societies that depend on them are part of the discussion. 

The synthesis of all this rapidly growing, often complex multidisciplinary, information can be difficult for non-scientists to assess. It is therefore essential to communicate the latest research in context of the full literature in an understandable form for policy makers and other stakeholders. This is the aim of this proposed fellowship. To do this well, to fill the science-policy gap, one must have the trust of both scientists and policy makers and an understanding of the science as well as the policy need. I am fortunate enough to have developed such trust and understanding over the last 10 years.

I will liaise, through emails and meetings, with scientists on forthcoming research publications and contribute to their analyses of how to gain enhanced impact of their NERC funded science. I will analyse, interpret and synthesise evidence on OA and other ocean stressors and brief UK Government Departments on the latest findings and set these within a global context. I will provide advice on the quality and relevance of evidence as well as give rapid, ad-hoc advice on specific issues when required. I will also brief and advise other non-governmental stakeholders of the latest scientific evidence.
I will also collaborate with other national research programmes and institutions to ensure the knowledge gained by all nations' programmes are effectively and jointly communicated to national and international policy makers. This will be achieved through attendance at their programme meetings and via email communication. I will work with international OA networks and centres (OA-ICC, OAiRUG, GOA-ON), to foster coordination and collaboration of new scientific research, and to enhance understanding and knowledge exchange with policy makers. In collaboration with the OAiRUG, I will organise a UK science-policy workshop, of key research scientists and stakeholders. 

In collaboration with other scientists, from the UK and other nations, I will communicate the findings at least annually to UN bodies, including the UNFCCC, and to the delegates during the key annual climate change negotiations so that informed decision making can be made.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>128268</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Scripps Institution of Oceanography</gtr:department><gtr:description>Hot, sour and breathless collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>FECF62B2-D0CE-4E5B-8B91-D0BF90D714FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A better understanding of the climate related ocean stressors by UN delegates so much so that for the first time ocean ecosystems have been mentioned in the UNFCCC Paris Agreement.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d194f525fae1.74992365-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Each partner contributes to the activities either in money or in kind.

Nationally, this involved briefing Government Departments, giving written and verbal evidence to the MPs STC enquiry into ocean acidification and contributing to the authorship of a number of reports aimed at informing UK policy makers (e.g. MCCIP). The fact that there was an enquiry into ocean acidification means that MP's were aware of it and wanted to know more.

Ocean issues are becoming more visible on the international (e.g. G7 Ocean initiative) and intergovernmental agenda. For example, the IPCC has began a Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere; an UNCLOS ICP meeting on Ocean Stressors will occur this May at the UN; the US State Department held a high level Our Ocean Conference; the Ocean and it ecosystems are in the UN Paris Agreement, there was the first UN Ocean Action Day at the UNFCCC COP22 in Marrakech (I participated in this, as mentioned in detail in the key finding and was co-author of the Strategic Action Roadmap on Oceans and Climate launched during the day), the UN Sustainable Developing Goal on the Ocean (#14) had its PrepCom meeting in February (I enabled and briefed another PML scientists to attend) and I will attend the implementation meeting in June at the UN in New York. I have been invited to become a member of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 Informal Preparatory Working Group 3 (IPWG3) - &amp;quot;Climate change, ocean acidification and impact reduction on marine biodiversity and ecosystems&amp;quot; in recognition of the impact that I have had to the development of STG 14.

I enabled a number of successful side events at the UNFCCC COP in Marrakech in 2016 through numerous collaborations with other scientific organisations, often taking the leadership but always guiding and enabling others in the process and helping other scientists value the benefits of knowledge exchange. This included a female scientist from Egypt who fought adversary to apply for and hold a side event on ocean change around African waters. Her national delegates attended the event and saw the elevation Egypt received from the side event and are now actively embracing the process. I also encouraged, mentored and facilitated the participation of students and mature scientists (from UK, Africa, France, Germany) to participate in side events and engage delegates at the exhibition stands. Their energy and enthusiasm was magnetic to the delegates and the feedback they got was very positive, several want to repeat the process and engage once more at this very high level. We have a new generation of scientists that understand the importance of KE!

The rising profile of the Ocean can also be seen in the increased interest by major media channels (e.g. Reuters and BBC) in developing programmes or extensive news stories and I have been pleased to help them do so. This including signposting them to scientific experts (some previously funded by UKOA). My invitation, by the Ocean Policy Research Institute (OPRI), funded by the Sasakawa Peace Foundation to give a keynote on science -policy KE and have further in depth discussions and follow up advice is further evidence of broader impact success of UKs approach to KE on ocean stressors.

I believe that I have played a role in continuing to raise the Ocean's profile.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D0D2A085-362D-4AD7-B058-7F5A584853D1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c193d02c2db3.11060099</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Ocean and Climate Platform</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A033D30A-E3EA-4E70-A12F-28ABE81AEEC4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Ocean and Climate Platform was formed to bring together experts to develop messages about the importance of the ocean in climate change and provides summaries, briefing notes and short messages for the general public as well as policy makers.
