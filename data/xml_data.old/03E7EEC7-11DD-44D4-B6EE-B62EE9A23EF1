creation of inclusive and integrated theatre for deaf audiences</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/R00983X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The AHRC/ESPRC Next Generation of Immersive Experiences call highlights the centrality of immersion to audiences' experience of performance: 'Whether recorded or performed live, dance, theatre, film, television and video games and other performances rely on the audiences' immersion in the experience'. However, not all audiences are easily able to experience such immersion: this research project brings together Red Earth Theatre, a small-scale touring theatre company with an established track record and commitment to research in inclusive integrated communication for young audiences (with a focus on deaf audiences) and an interdisciplinary team of researchers across arts and computer sciences at the University of Nottingham to explore solutions for those audiences for whom, up until now, immersion in performance has been hindered by modes of accessibility that divide and distract attention. Red Earth's 'total communication' approach to making theatre aims to integrate modes of communication - including metaphor, symbol, costume, set, lighting, auditory, signed, oral, written - immersively within the theatrical aesthetics of the performance, but the work required to achieve this is expensive and demanding for small- and medium-scale theatre companies. Working together through a series of iterative workshops and events with key stakeholders from the deaf community, this project will explore the potential for the use of cheap or freely available immersive technologies to support further development of integrated inclusiveness for deaf audiences in small scale touring productions. It will develop prototype approaches that can be shared with other companies and venues as well as - potentially - signposting opportunities to develop similar approaches with other groups with different accessibility needs. The Arts Council's Creative Case for Diversity, published in 2011, states that 'the Arts Council wishes to encourage those we fund and partner to be responsible for creating the conditions on the ground for further equality in the arts. We believe this approach will lead to a greater diversity of artistic expression connecting with a wider audience for the work'. This project's focus on supporting and enabling immersive experiences for audiences who are often alienated by mainstream theatre will help Red Earth deliver on that ambition.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this research project will be felt at local, national and potentially international levels, and within two key sectors:

1. Audiences. This research will benefit those audiences for whom, up until now, immersion in performance has been hindered by modes of accessibility that divide and distract attention. In this initial phase of research, this group will be audiences on the spectrum of D/deafness from profoundly D/deaf to hard of hearing whose experience of going to the theatre is often that of having an interpreter 'stuck on the side' and 'having to move my head from side to side' (Red Earth Mirror Mirror research, 2017). That research demonstrated a demand for integrated and inclusive theatre for D/deaf audiences: 'Maybe D/deaf people think, &amp;quot;it's going to be a story with an Interpreter at the side&amp;quot;. D/deaf people don't want that'. 
 a. Local audiences to whom Red Earth tours - including deaf and hearing school children and families across the Midlands region - will thus benefit from the development of prototype technologies to support accessible design for inclusive immersive theatre that is integrated in terms of both access and aesthetics from the beginning of the creative. Partner Reigate Park School highlights the importance of sharing 'cultural experiences together and with greater equity'.
b. Beyond Red Earth's audiences, our findings will also have impact for audiences on the spectrum of D/deafness from profoundly D/deaf to hard of hearing, both for other companies and venues with whom the research findings will be shared at our final event in September 2018 and through sharing of the research summary and findings via the Arts Council Creative Case organisations and more widely. By challenging traditional conceptions of accessibility by focussing specifically on immersive technologies, the project will contribute to the growing body of work conducted on deafness in the field of accessibility and will add further equality in the arts by not only designing more inclusive modes of access to D/deaf audiences, but also challenging accessibility practice at local and national levels, and potentially beyond. With 360 million people worldwide suffering from disabling hearing loss (World Health Organisation), including 9 million in the UK (British Deaf Association), this project will not only raise awareness of D/deaf communities and feed into the reflection about the role and nature of accessibility but also initiate new ways to think about the way it is put into practice, specifically in the context of deafness. 
c. Longer term, we would aim to work with companies and their audiences on different spectra of disability - such as autism or visual impairment - to see if our prototype technologies and approaches could support accessible immersion for those audiences too. We will also take advantage of our links with China and Malaysia to explore the challenges of our approach in the context of international sign languages.

2. Theatre sector. Pathways to impact to the wider theatre sector are designed into the project through the partnership support of Ramps on the Moon - whose partners are working together to grow audiences for mid to large scale integrated touring, engaging increased numbers of disabled audiences, creating a strong, collaborative touring circuit of six mid to large scale venues and sharing learning and training within the sector - while NPOs in the region with a commitment to diversity (mac Birmingham, DASH, Arena Theatre, Wolverhampton, Attenborough Centre and CURVE, Leicester, Derby Theatre will be invited to the Event 3 final sharing showcase and discussion). More widely, the sector will benefit from access to the project website, summary and open source technologies and documentation, distributed nationally via Arts Council England's Creative Case lead officer, and shared with key arts organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37181</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R00983X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2DB2E75A-C815-466B-A26B-60EB301AD722</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dramaturgy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E66DC80-F20F-4AC2-915A-AF46F5C6ED14</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interpreting &amp; Translation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80A9D6C5-792D-4DD9-9138-BEC1BB556AA9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technology and method dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB55E3F-FFEA-4BE8-9850-37FB373F4D31</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
