development</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K007521/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This one-year feasibility study led by the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships (CRFR) will explore and establish an Evidence Request Bank to produce and share appraised summaries of evidence for the voluntary and public sectors, in direct response to their practice needs.This fills a gap, opening up the evidence base for delivering public and voluntary services, particularly around early years, social care and other areas of potential preventative work. It creates a channel for partnership development and shared service development.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The evidence bank will respond to requests for reviews of evidence from practitioners or policy-makers in the partner organisations:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Children in Scotland&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Parenting Across Scotland&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>West Lothian Council.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The process is as follows:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>define topic area and research questions for each review with the relevant partner,&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>CRFR carry out the review and write up the evidence in plain language,&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>peer review the scope and findings of the review through a panel of academic and user reviewers&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the partnership discuss the Evidence Request findings and share it more widely with others interested in the topic&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>partners use the evidence to inform practice, policy and service developments as appropriate.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Partnership funding has also been obtained from The Scottish Government.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As a knowledge exchange project, the needs of non-academic partners are central to the whole approach. The project will be of immediate benefit to the main partners and to a wider group of potential stakeholders who share similar interests and concerns about developing services. Ultimately it will benefit the services users and wider publics through increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy and by enhancing quality of life, and health through the development of practice. 

West Lothian Council (WLC) staff working within the areas of violence against women, equalities, child protection, and early interventions with children and families within WLC will be directly included in the project.

Parenting across Scotland (PAS) is a partnership of charities which offers support to thousands of parents and children in Scotland. Both PAS and partner agencies will benefit from the evidence bank as described above, and PAS will provide a link between the project and relevant policy-makers in the Scottish Government. Ultimate beneficiaries through the PAS partnership are parents and children using partner services.
 
Children in Scotland (CiS) is the national agency and united voice of over 400 voluntary, statutory and professional organisations and individuals working with children and their families in Scotland. CiS staff and members will benefit from the project. Ultimate beneficiaries through the CiS channel will be children and their families who use the statutory and voluntary sector services provided by CiS members.

Academic beneficiaries: The project will also benefit academics and PhD students interested in developing skills for working with and communicating to non-academic partners. In particular PhD students engaged with the project will develop skills in the selection, review and apprising of evidence and in writing in plain language for a mixed audience. They will gain insight into the concerns of those delivering and developing service which may enhance their ability to develop relevant research in their future careers.

Partners and wider groups who share similar interests will benefit through: 
1) Appraised reviews of relevant and reliable evidence to 
* inform service planning, practitioner knowledge and funding bids
* strengthen services
* increase collaboration and improve efficiency
* support services to respond to public sector change
2) Practical access to and confidence in use of research, the benefits of an evidence-based approach, and how this relates to practice
3) Improved capacity for assessing quality of evidence
4) Opportunities to share research-based knowledge and use this as a starting point for collaboration, partnership and development of services with other public sector and third sector colleagues also in the &amp;quot;Bank&amp;quot;

Ultimately the development of services and practice based on a clear appraisal of the evidence can contribute to the development of new services that respond to the needs of service users, improved and evidence-based practices. These contribute to increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy; and to enhancing quality of life, and health of relevant service users.

The impact of the project will be evaluated through an overarching impact assessment using a Research Contribution Framework developed by Morton (2012) and utilized in a number of other projects by CRFR. This framework will be used to help develop, plan and evaluate the programme, ensuring its effectiveness.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>94220</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Parenting Across Scotland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Main partners on ERB</gtr:description><gtr:id>7ACA9E74-A65B-4F1F-83B6-EA3948F82848</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs: Evidence Request Bank (2014) Evidence Response: Family Households: How have family households in Scotland changed over 2001-2011?Full Report.

Project staff explored issues around knowledge exchange and evidence use with other knowledge brokers (IRISS, EPPI Centre and NHS Health Scotland evidence into action team), leading to sharing sessions and informal networks.

The evidence review on transition to primary school was used by staff at West Lothian Council to create a driver diagram demonstrating successful transition. The driver diagram was used with nursery and primary school staff to identify ways they could improve transitions (through tests of change). This work has been shared and discussed throughout the council to reinforce the value of evidence-based practice, it has helped to improve the culture around evidence-informed practice with practitioners working around transitions by demonstrating how evidence can help them to do their work. This example has also informed others via the Scottish Government Early Years Collaborative. The evidence review of trends and statistics of family households has been used by PAS as the basis for the engagement event reported elsewhere; to update and inform the PAS website, specific reports (e.g. on work-life balance), and development and planning activities; to raise awareness around the evidence and inter-related issues across third and public sector children and families organisations through PAS members and networks (including through presentations and discussion events); highlight where gaps in data exist to support third sector organisations to identify areas for innovation and funding proposals; specific data was shared with Scottish Government strategy leads and the Childcare Commission. The evidence report was also used by other partners to inform consultation responses and evidence to parliamentary committees (CIS); and to produce an infographic which was shared widely with policy colleagues to consider in their planning and development of policy (Scottish Government). Both evidence reviews have been used to develop training for the children's sector workforce. CRFR has taken learning from the pilot into its knowledge exchange work: as outlined elsewhere, funding has been secured to further develop the Evidence Bank through the ESRC funded programme What Works Scotland on which Morton is a Co-Investigator; ways of presenting evidence in actionable formats developed by the Evidence Bank are being delivered through What Works Scotland; CRFR's training programme on communicating for knowledge exchange has been further developed and is being delivered to CRFR staff and students, and we are pursuing opportunities to deliver this training across the School of Social and Political Sciences. With What Works Scotland, a half day seminar was held in April 2015 for public and voluntary sector organisations - 'Using evidence to develop public services'. The seminar explored the issues and challenges of using different kinds of evidence to inform action. It provided an opportunity to think about how to use evidence, and give some concrete examples of how others(including Evidence Bank partners) have successfully applied evidence to their work.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>645EF762-CDEE-4D3D-AFE7-6BAEA95731B2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460ab01cfe643.02302880</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Understanding and having timely access to reliable evidence of what might work is essential to the delivery of services in the public and voluntary sectors. Working with our partners who deliver services and policies for the children and families sector we developed and piloted a model for delivering evidence to practitioners and policy makers. 

In developing the model, a range of issues were considered including: whether the evidence met the needs of the requester; value for money and affordability; desirable features and products; tools and processes; timescales and Evidence Bank capacity and planning regarding supply/demand. A process for reviewing and presenting evidence was developed to support evidence users to identify gaps in knowledge, to present reliable and relevant evidence to address those gaps in ways are accessible and link evidence to action, and to support evidence users to consider how they can use and share evidence. 

In piloting, we found that partners valued support to identify what they wanted to know and to develop the processes and tools needed to implement evidence change; clear communications and open discussion at all stages of producing an evidence review fostered shared understanding, managed expectations over what the evidence does and doesn't say, and helped ensure reports addressed the knowledge gaps; and discussing how to use evidence helped to integrate thinking within teams and direct resources effectively.

In addition, involving external reviewers increased their understanding of how to present information for third and public sectors. Involving doctoral students in the process and training to write evidence reports helped them realise the complexity of evidence user's environments.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The four partner organisations are all continuing to use the evidence delivered under this project. West Lothian Council and The Scottish Government are using the review on transitions between nursery and primary school to inform their work with the Early Years Collaborative. Parenting Across Scotland are using the demographic report on families to develop services. Children in Scotland are using both reports to develop and deliver their training programme. CRFR is using learning from the pilot, and models and tools developed, to inform further development of the Evidence Bank with What Works Scotland and by doing so is producing further action-focussed evidence resources for public sector services.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EA65D0DC-00CF-44CD-A592-FBAF928E7CA7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460ad0bc98bc1.72470781</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.crfr.ac.uk/projects/current-projects/erb</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Transitions from nursery to primary</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>79958646-C231-4FCC-9CBC-69EE195033D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Staff at West Lothian Council created a driver diagram demonstrating successful transition from nursery to primary school based on the evidence review.
