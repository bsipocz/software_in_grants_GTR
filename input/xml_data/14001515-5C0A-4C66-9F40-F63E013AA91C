Child care for HIV infected children in rural areas is also hampered by the lack of trained staff and laboratory support; and simplified treatment guidelines are required to ensure good services under these circumstances. To help closing this gap, a cohort of HIV infected children and of children exposed to HIV (because their mothers are infected) has been enrolled and followed at the MRCs field site in rural SW Uganda since 2002. These children are followed at regular intervals, and treated whenever ill. In 2005, antiretroviral treatment (ART) was introduced for children who are in need of it. There are effective medical interventions to prevent the transmission of HIV from an infected mother to her baby during or after birth or during the breastfeeding period. In Uganda, national guidelines recommend the provision of certain antiretroviral drugs for this purpose that are given to mothers before delivery and to mothers and their babies after delivery. Other strategies include improved delivery care practices; the feeding of babies with formula milk where possible, or early weaning after exclusive breast-feeding. In reality, such prevention of mother-to-child-transmission activities encounter numerous practical problems. Examples include long distances that may prevent mothers from making timely use of delivery or PMTCT services; or stigmatisation if a mother is seen not to follow commonly accepted feeding practices, etc. In this project, MRC investigates the degree to which PMTCT services are functioning. Innovative PMTCT strategies that try to overcome the various obstacles against effective PMTCT are developed and evaluated.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Purpose: The PC/PMTCT project aims (1) to study the impact of HIV infection on the morbidity and mortality among children in rural Uganda; (2) to identify ways to optimise the medical care for these children in rural areas, (3) to establish a prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) project and (4) to explore how the physical development, and the morbidity and mortality of children born to HIV-infected mothers can be improved. Methods: Paediatric cohort: Paediatric care is provided to HIV-positive and HIV-exposed children (and some HIV-negative unexposed children as controls and to avoid stigmatisation of HIV-infected children). The work began in 2002 when an initial group of children known to be HIV-positive from the annual surveys of the MRC General Population Cohort (GPC) Project (see separate abstract) was enrolled into clinical care. Thereafter, children have been enrolled as early as possible in life. Participants are seen every 3 months and whenever ill. Clinical information is collected through questionnaire, physical examination and laboratory investigations. The provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for eligible children has been introduced in 2005. HIV infected children and those with known maternal exposure to HIV receive cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. Definite infection status of exposed children is established by PCR after weaning. PMTCT Project: The Ministry of Health recommends facility-based provision of antiretroviral drugs for PMTCT. However, many mothers in rural Uganda do not deliver in health facilities, and PMTCT services are not easily accessible to them. An alternative community based approach is therefore being tested in this operational research project: The population has access to small peripheral counselling stations. Voluntary HIV Counselling and Testing (VCT) and PMTCT are actively promoted through field workers. HIV-positive pregnant women who agree to make use of service are provided with drugs according to national guidelines to take home for use when labour starts. They are asked to call a fieldworker to administer this treatment to the child soon after birth.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2004-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1213603</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6D34A08B-1348-4B37-AF2E-9E939607053F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Operational evaluation of a service for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in rural Uganda: barriers to uptake of single-dose nevirapine and the role of birth reporting.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Tropical medicine &amp; international health : TM &amp; IH</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b65faab364d22d5a6d431a1a6b9220b3"><gtr:id>b65faab364d22d5a6d431a1a6b9220b3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barigye H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1360-2276</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>DhJ6PwbjxQ2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U950080929</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>9A8BEDCC-D902-4C9A-8CCF-C974265EA3FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>67</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.4  Surveillance and distribution</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E4AF608A-CDB6-4CE6-AA10-95B3E043E22F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.1  Organisation and delivery of services</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
