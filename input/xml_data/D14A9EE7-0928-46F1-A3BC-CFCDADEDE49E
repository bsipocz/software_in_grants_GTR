Responding to the challenges presented by long-term ill-health is a major concern across health and welfare policy arenas. Within this policy debate, the high prevalence of 'multi-morbidity' is receiving increased attention.
&lt;br />
&lt;br />While most research and services are based on a single disease paradigm, in reality many individuals have more than one long-term condition simultaneously and the co-existence of mental and physical ill-health is common.&amp;nbsp; There is a dearth of research that examines such overlapping health problems and policy and service responses frequently fail to recognise and meet these complex needs.
&lt;br />
&lt;br />This fellowship involves statistical analyses of a high quality health and wellbeing survey conducted among Sheffield residents in 2000 to examine:
&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;ul>
 &lt;li>the patterns and predictors of 'multi-morbidity' (particularly the co-existence of mental and physical conditions);&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>the consequences of 'multi-morbidity' for healthcare use and social wellbeing;&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>the implications of these patterns and relationships for health and welfare policy and practice responses.&lt;/li>

comorbidity, and particularly coincidence of depression and
chronic physical health conditions, among a large sample
of Sheffield residents; with older age and low
socioeconomic status being positively associated with such
comorbidity. Our results also strongly suggest that the
presence of depression contributes to non-elective
inpatient use and risk of mortality irrespective of chronic
physical health conditions, but that the risks are particularly
high for people who are co-morbid with depression.
There are a number of limitations in using cross sectional,
self-reported health measures that mean that other
explanations cannot be completely ruled out, particularly
the possibility of undetected morbidities or more severe
physical morbidity among those with depression.
Nevertheless, the findings are consistent with other recent
work reported above and indicate the need to understand
more about how depression may complicate care and
contribute to poorer outcomes.
The findings suggest that better management of
depression among people with chronic health conditions
has the potential to improve the lives of individual patients
and make better use of NHS resources. The results
therefore imply that greater efforts should be made to
diagnose and treat depression in primary care, particularly
among older people and those with chronic health
conditions. Though some relevant initiatives are underway
in Sheffield and nationally, this project suggests the
importance of expanding such work so that screening tools
for depression are used routinely by a wider range of
community staff; a recommendation that was endorsed by
clinicians and practitioners at our Project Advisory Group
meetings. More generally, the findings underscore the
need for co- and multimorbidity to receive greater
attention among health and social researchers</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have informed the development of a programme of work on mental illhealth and physical illhealth now being undertaken as part of CLAHRC Yorkshire &amp;amp; Humber.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8C9EA554-77D4-4F41-936C-6F6923E245B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54494da6b890c8.00586820</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.restore.ac.uk/UPTAP/project39.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>988E3B2B-DA16-4FC4-A2AF-C3B7C26E1463</gtr:id><gtr:title>Patterns, predictors and implications of multimorbidity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d6d4d4d7f2ba174b16fabd32eecd3bf7"><gtr:id>d6d4d4d7f2ba174b16fabd32eecd3bf7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Joanne Coy (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>1900-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_7616234984cbe0262c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G002703/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-163-27-0021</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FFA3A6C9-532B-4B83-B6F7-AAF3E63D34F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Stats., Comp. &amp; Methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
