Under conditions of continuing economic crisis, scholars and policy-makers are having to reshape their assumptions about the nature of society: particularly in respect of who receives assistance and who funds and arranges it. Where the 'usual' targets of welfare and benefits were the poor or destitute, they now include those who work but cannot make ends meet, and who experience increasing numbers of complex problems for which they need advice. And where the 'usual' provider of such things, at least in the post-war years, has been the state, this is increasingly not the case. As the economic crisis proceeds apace and the state's role is being whittled down, access to the counsel of experts is nonetheless increasingly essential. Without prejudging the outcomes, the project will investigate novel arrangements and their unintended consequences. It will explore innovations in advice giving provided by existing offices (under more traditional state-funded regimes), by new sources and novel agencies (under non-governmental and market-driven schemes), and by the social movements, self-help and informal network-based arrangements to which many are increasingly having to turn for counsel and support. 

The project proposes intensive research along two axes. Firstly, it explores in detail selected sites and cases in the UK (specifically England where a very particular set of legal/welfare arrangements is in operation), 'drilling down' to examine specific institutional settings, themes and topics at a range of different scales and levels. Topics and sites include a focus on the three specific areas of housing, debt and immigration advice, both within and beyond particular institutional settings, and law courts where litigants have started to engage in self-representation. Secondly, it uses two carefully-selected cross-national comparisons in order to illuminate, and gain a critical perspective on, aspects of UK welfare-related advice processes which are often taken as natural/inevitable by local policy-makers. 

Across these different settings, the project will:

document the ongoing effects on advice giving of the withdrawal of legal aid funds, including the rise of self-litigation; 

explore the new roles assumed by bureaucrats, intermediaries and self-help groups, who are increasingly important in the advice encounter; 

investigate whether funding cuts have caused the dwindling of the much-vaunted empathy that advice-givers are often required to deliver and whether, in the process, advisers are becoming less effective at shaping the behaviour of those they counsel; 

look at how the very character of advice is changing as a result of these complex transformations;

explore variations between selected national settings, to illuminate the changing and context-dependent character of advice in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Users benefiting from our research are those lobbying against further cuts to advice services, and those seeking new and innovative ways to provide such services in times of austerity. Working in organisations, policy think-tanks, and activist groups, these interlocutors have already been engaged in consultations during the design of this project in its seed-funded phase. We intend to build on these connections -- some will serve on our advisory group while others will be consulted on a more personal and informal basis in the course of research and eventually participate in our dissemination workshop - as well as bringing them into consultation with one another. The aim is to furnish useful evidence which will help to challenge stereotyped public perceptions with which practitioners must contend when contesting received wisdom and/or seeking funds to help themselves stay afloat. While aiming to maximise impact, we need to address diverse audiences separately where necessary; LSE's press office will help us frame findings appropriately so as to communicate with each of them.

Advisory Board
Our project is designed around collaborative dimensions that cross borders between disciplines (especially law and anthropology), and academic and non-academic worlds. We will draw on representatives drawn from our stakeholder organisations, and from the legal and anthropological academic communities, to set and steer the research agenda. The advisory board will include figures of national standing from the third sector - David Robinson (CL), Phil Jew (Wandsworth Citizens Advice Bureau), Chilli Reed (Advice UK), legal anthropologist Professor Anthony Good (University of Edinburgh), and Jon Robins (Guardian Law journalist).
Insights from board members will provide guidance, helping frame interim publication of findings appropriately and shaping final outputs so as to maximise their impact to those in these sectors.

Policy Users
Previous successful knowledge exchanges demonstrate the thirst in public and policy arenas for ethnographically-based evidence on advice-giving. Significant connections already established with users of our ethnography-based approach to advice will be built upon and further expanded: New Economics Foundation (NEF), AdviceUK, and charitable organisations like Community Links and the Baring Foundation. Having read our earlier findings on legal advice, contacts referenced these in their own reports documenting the importance of one-to-one relationships in the giving of effective advice, and used them in campaigns lobbying against further cuts. These contacts establish the basis for further policy-related impact; their interest in the research demonstrates that such organisations are in search of ethnographically-based evidence to substantiate their claims about the value of empathetic advice to welfare claimants of various kinds. Further outlets include collaboration with anti-legal-aid-cuts networks such as the one initiated in 2013 by Conor Gearty and Richard Moorhead. The government consultation closed on 4 June 2013, but the group remains active on related matters. 

Complement quantitative data 
Our use of specifically ethnographic methods aims to capture the specificities of advice that have been (and might further be) missed by those who gather survey-style information by more quantitative means or using an approach based on targeted interviews; producing policy-relevant material to complement data sets.

Engage with the media 
Alice Forbess, a researcher who co-designed the project during the seed-funding phase, will work on consolidating, analysing, and disseminating results in consultation with members of the advisory board, write blogs and newspaper pieces, and organise the academic/policy dissemination workshop.

Academic/policy dissemination workshop
An academic/policy workshop will take place in London in the final year of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1313270</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Team member's discussion at a session on housing precarity in London today.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A6D1BAF-D2D6-4BA8-8520-48B34B6C51E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Matt Wilde spoke at the 'Housing Precarity in London Today: Action Research amd Creating Change' session as part of the QMUL GradFest 2017 held in February 2017.
