&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;How has state building-oriented research sponsored by DFID influenced and interacted with UK governmental policies targeting fragile, post-conflict environments?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Previous studies of the research-policy nexus focused primarily upon interview-based narratives assembled long after policy formulation. As such an additional objective is the strengthening of methodologies for assessing research influence on policy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will employ two key methods. The first, oriented around measurement of 'rate of return', will identify research clusters of related issues pertaining to state building and employ standardised criteria to measure corresponding changes&lt;br />in policy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It will then engage researchers and policymakers to establish explanatory narratives for ttie 'returns' identified. Secondly, the investigators will 'forward-track' the dissemination, use, and uptake of recentiy completed DFID-sponsored studies,&lt;br />physically map research transmission applying a 'payback model', and determine what factors increase or impede its influence.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Field research will be conducted in three country case studies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will also assess the impact of research quality within all elements of the methodology, addressing concems that the rapid growth of state building research has resulted in weak approaches.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296847</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newsletter: Issue No. 1</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9D964196-3F85-438A-B4A6-617360FA7134</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Provides updates in relation to the activities of the three-year

As such the findings offered broad insights into the nature of the research-policy nexus while offering some recommendations as to how the relationship could be enhanced through the introduction of certain measures whilst also building on existing processes. 

While the recommendations and outputs have been disseminated to parts of the UK development policy community, and we are aware that dedicated meetings have been held within DfID examining and discussing some of the project outputs, it is too early to determine to what extent specific recommendations have been adopted (other than being part of a general gradual evidence-based policy-making reform process, which has been ongoing for a number of years and which is outlined in our book). 

At best, it would be accurate to note that at this stage the research has prompted debate and discussion within DfID and it remains to be seen what progress will be made in enhancing the use of research and evidence in policy and practice.

As such, attributing any specific outcomes - beyond the promotion of internal dialogue - is not possible at this stage. We would hope to observe some changes - based on our proposals - within relevant government departments over the next year or two.

The research team believes that it is much too early to determine the deeper cultural, societal or economic impacts of this research. Our hope would be that ultimately the research could lead to more effective and efficient public policy in the field of international development, statebuilding and governance reform through more robust processes of research utilisation and evidence-based decision-making and programming.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EDF69CD4-A880-448C-953C-A362745D72C9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5486d5d23924a6.68921916</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A striking finding of this study - as outlined in the project book, Understanding Influence: The Use of Statebuilding Research in British Policy (Ashgate, 2014) - is the overall evidence of extensive statebuilding research use and influence in British policy, and this appears to have increased and improved over time. Our research does not point to any 'crisis' or major shortcoming in research use in general. Research is used regularly, widely and at all levels of statebuilding policymaking and programming. While clearly strongest in DfID, there are signs that other departments, such as the FCO, MoD and the tri-departmental Stabilisation Unit are increasingly engaging with research, albeit to a limited extent. 



Another general finding relates to the extremely varied types and levels of influence depending on such diverse factors as the country context, political situation, levels of instability, attributes of the research, precise policy issue at hand, and even the character of personnel at any given time. Perhaps most importantly, uptake can be greatly affected by attributes specific to the particular output in question, such as its focus, form, quality or presentation. All these points were especially apparent in our findings from the three case study countries as presented in the article, 'The Use of Statebuilding Research in Fragile Contexts: Evidence from British Policymaking in Afghanistan, Nepal and Sierra Leone' published in the Journal of Statebuilding and Intervention. 



A major finding is the presence of a process that we term 'cumulative influence'. This was particularly apparent with respect to the research on political settlements, which will serve as the basis for a forthcoming journal article. In this process, individual pieces may not appear to generate significant movement or influence in policy circles, but as such studies are complemented by further research, either by the same researchers or others, findings become part of a broader 'critical mass' of evidence which will in all likelihood eventually penetrate policy circles, shift thinking and catalyse policy change. The process is neither inevitable nor smooth; rather it is iterative, incremental, non-linear and ad hoc. The speed or extent to which this process takes place is determined by, amongst other things: prominent factors relating to the specific policy context; the existence or otherwise of various barriers and facilitators; and the effectiveness of available 'translation' functions.



Such influence as has been identified has been diverse, essentially capturing the full range of types described in the theoretical literature. Yet, whether influence was direct or indirect, this is not necessarily an accurate measure of its ultimate significance. In fact, our findings suggest that over time academic research - as opposed to directly commissioned analyses and reports - has had a more significant influence in shaping and framing broad policy approaches, and largely through more indirect forms of conceptual 'enlightenment' rather than the instrumental application of findings. Research funded by DfID was not consciously favoured by officials, and policy papers clearly demonstrate that a wide range of sources have been drawn upon. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that DfID funded research has achieved disproportionately higher influence overall.



In general, given the powerful role of chance and contingency, enhancing uptake is arguably about identifying and targeting certain discrete areas for improvement which build on existing strengths, encourage dynamic cultures of research use and promoting understanding between the producers and consumers of research. Our research has drawn attention to a number of prominent critical issues that remain to be fully addressed by both researchers and policymakers (and are presented in full in our report for DfID): designing realistic institutional incentives; developing staff skills and experience in handling and appraising research; improving the research component of inductions and pre-deployment briefings for officials taking up positions in country offices; revamping knowledge management structures, research repositories and institutional memory; enhancing efficient and effective intermediary services; supporting and promoting formal and informal knowledge-policy networks; building local research capacity; providing opportunities for secondments and exchanges across the research and policy worlds; optimising the substance and presentation of research; and strengthening the awareness and communication of existing research activities throughout government.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the project hold out the prospect of significantly increasing the value for money of government funded research. In particular, the set of recommendations put forward could lead to more effective and efficient ways of utilising taxpayers money by increasing the uptake of commissioned research in policy.



The research may also indirectly promote better informed approaches and policies toward the development and security of fragile states and poverty alleviation, as officials improve and enhance their ability to manage, use and deploy available evidence and research in designing their programmes and determining broader trajectories of developmental assistance.



The project website will provide an open resource for anyone interested in the issues surrounded research uptake and influence, and many of the findings are transferable to other policy domains, especially within the social sciences where findings may be contested, concepts poorly defined and policy formulation in associated areas of public life pervaded by competing political agendas.
 Central to exploiting the findings of the research will be a dissemination event held at DfID in June 2014 in which we will present the project report, outline key findings and present suggested recommendations to relevant policymakers. Country office advisers and mangers will participate by video conference. This builds on an earlier event held at the House of Lords in 2013 at which we presented interim findings to a range of politicians, officials and non-governmental representatives.



The research team has produced a broad range of written outputs intended to reach a variety of relevant audiences, these include: mid-term papers outlining project progress (disseminated to officials in DfID); a co-authored book which will be published by Ashgate later in 2014; a shorter tailored policy report for DfID; and a number of articles published in established, high-quality and policy-relevant journals.



In order to maximise academic impact research team members have attended and presented at a number of academic conferences and research seminars, such as at Birmingham University and the International Studies Association Conference. We have also integrated our findings into teaching activities, such as on the PRDU's two Masters courses and at the PRDU/ODI's Advanced Course on Conflict, Crisis and Transitions. The more informal dissemination of the findings amongst prominent networks has taken place at various events attended by the research team, such as at Georgetown, Canberra and Harvard Universities.



The actual conduct of the research has also been important: indeed, participants frequently noted how they have reflected more on the issues raised simply by answering our questions in interviews or the survey and found the process itself enlightening. It prompted some to suggest that DfID does need to think more strategically about research uptake and has generated a lively discussion with government.



The project has also attracted the attention of the External Champion for RCUK's Global Uncertainties Programme as the grant was closing and we have now been invited to participate in an 'Enhanced Impact Scheme'.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5DC955DD-91AD-4B53-94E3-A6B4D15B9927</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3640892611.4820805b2f26b08</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.york.ac.uk/politics/centres/prdu/research/esrc-dfid-research/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5FD035FC-1452-46E5-905F-6825DE941836</gtr:id><gtr:title>Conflict analysis for the twenty-first century</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Conflict, Security &amp;
