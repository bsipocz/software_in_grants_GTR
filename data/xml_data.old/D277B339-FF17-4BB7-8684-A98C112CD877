Impact strategy

Our impact strategy comprises:

? Scientific advancement of knowledge: to provide new insights into community resilience to flooding and how community resilience might be developed by communities themselves and by supporting agencies in flood risk management (FRM).

? Development of skills and capabilities in organisations and communities: to develop skills in how to develop, sustain and work with community memory and lay knowledge through the framing of 'sustainable flood memory'.

? Impact on health, wealth and culture: to benefit the local communities in our four case-study areas and other communities at risk of flooding by offering ways to exchange and archive lay/local knowledge that encourage preparedness and action for future flooding and flood risk.

? Economic development: to offer practical outcomes that can contribute to increased community preparedness for flood risk.


2. Emerging economic and societal impact 

The key societal impacts of our research have included increasing and increased awareness of the relationships between memory, lay knowledge and resilience amongst UK and international flood risk management professionals, and the public themselves in community settings. This has started to generate impact at national and regional levels as set out below, and we continue to work with agencies and communities in increasing this impact. This work is on-going through the nested ESRC Knowledge Exchange award where we are working with flood risk communities, national and regional Environment Agency partners, the regional County Rural Community Council and Local Government to generate digital stories based upon our research. This involves collaboratively drawing themes on 'preparedness' from our original semi-structured interviews, as viewed through different resilience lenses. This provides opportunities for communities themselves and partner agencies to facilitate exchanges within and between communities about preparedness and resilience in relation to flood risk. 


3. Impact settings

The project methodology was crafted to maximise stakeholder engagement and impact throughout the project in varied ways. We have had impact insofar as we have communities and agencies engaging with, and in several cases acting on, our messages - through our Stakeholder Competency Group (SCG), end of project conference and other engagement activities. 

? Stakeholder Competency Group: Our methodology integrated co-production throughout the project with a Stakeholder Competency Group of ca. 10 key stakeholders from communities (representatives including local councillor (member), flood action group representative), local government, the Environment Agency, National Flood Forum (including Scottish Flood Forum), Rural Community Council, emergency services, and county archives. The SCG operated through six-monthly face-to-face meetings (seven in total), with an email group for interim exchanges. Meetings were recorded and transcribed as research evidence for analysis. This approach allowed us to work with, and exchange dialogue with, key stakeholders throughout the project to ensure that organisational and societal impacts were on-going and not just delivered at the end. Stakeholders benefited from inter-professional exchanges and learning, and being part of a learning community of practice. For example, this included co-writing an article on our research findings in Cotswold Life with Gloucestershire Rural Community Council. 

An evaluation of the SCG process was undertaken in November 2013 at the end of the ESRC Sustainable Flood Memories project (although all stakeholders have continued working with us during the ESRC Knowledge Exchange phase of the project). In answer to the question 'What have you learnt about the value of flood memory from involvement in the project?', stakeholder comments included:

'The emotional linkages and the depth of them'
'The importance of memory as tips for practical application'
'Community input could be better applied by authorities'

Indicative responses to the question: 'How might that knowledge be useful/used in the work of your organisation(s) in flood risk management?', we found that the research findings are being used in various ways, for example, in the training of FRM professionals in the Environment Agency; and in thinking anew about strategies for community engagement by agencies that do not rely on marketing methods (as previously). Quotes from the stakeholders include:

'we could certainly use the flood memory information particularly during the recovery from flooding, to guide what support flood victims most require.'

'I feel that some of the outputs of the project such as the Flood Stories are a really useful 'thought provoking' tool to provide awareness and a 'voice' from flood victims to use in training sessions etc.'

'Communities learn from their peers in particular. Would be good to use local memories in training the groups working in association with the community plan.'
 
'We could update the communities section of our Community Emergency Plan toolkit with such memories and point to good practice and avoiding issues.'

? End of project conference (November 2013): Here we shared our research findings with professionals who input into FRM (including those working in the media and archives), and community members alongside an interdisciplinary mix of academics. Several of the organisations had already reflected on their own engagement with lay knowledge and archiving of flood memory in our earlier research processes. The discussions and scoping were designed to encourage reflection on the impacts of our research and how different types of knowledge might be integrated in decision-making in FRM. This input into the design of our website legacy (including our archive of co-produced digital stories).

? Working with communities: There were also benefits in the communities that we engaged with - with several contributors working with us longitudinally during the ESRC Sustainable Flood Memories project and the linked ESRC Knowledge Exchange project. This engendered associated critical reflection on the relationships between individual and community flood memory, lay knowledges and preparedness for future flooding. The findings are also being used by community groups (e.g. flood action groups) to help promote the value of flood memory and exchange of lay knowledges in flood risk contexts. In addition, the project has had impact in terms of &amp;quot;social therapy&amp;quot; for the elderly, vulnerable people who have embraced the project, with engagement as a kind of cathartic exercise.

? Working with advisors to government: We were invited to present/ contribute to panel discussions at the Royal United Services Institute conference (RUSI; organisation that generates independent thinking to inform resilience planning in UK government) in November 2014. This talk engendered inter-professional dialogue, particularly about the implications of 'active forgetting' and 'active remembering' about flood risk in community resilience planning. It was clear from that event that some of the learning about relationships between memory, lay knowledge and resilience was relevant to other risk settings (e.g. in overseas work on polio with UNICEF). 

? Promoting inter-professional dialogue: the research results of the project have been shared in other fora - with mixed participation and co-learning. These included:

- mixed academic-invited practitioner audiences (e.g. conferences like Royal Geographical Society Annual Conference in 2012 and 2013 where we involved the National Flood Forum (as invited practitioners); a keynote to mixed audiences of Irish and UK academics and Irish FRM professionals (such as the Irish Drainage Board) at NUI Galway in March 2012). 

- targeted knowledge exchange with specific professional groups who are active in building more general community resilience. These groups include arts practitioners who co-work with communities on environmental issues (e.g. in keynote to an audience of arts practitioners - co-working with water/flood risk/ resilience themes - and academics at Middlesex University in June 2013). 

- tailored exchange of research findings to groups with particular resilience interests. For example, we shared our research findings on emotional resilience through leading a themed workshop in SW Health Development Annual Conference (Dartlington 2014). 

- On-engagement with other professional groups in discussion around the research results - e.g. the regional (SW) Fire and Rescue community and the Gloucestershire Local Resilience Forum - about how the insights into how memory, lay knowledge and resilience interweave might be used both in in-house training and in informing engagement strategies with communities who have experienced recent flooding or are at future flood risk. This has resulted in closer longitudinal engagement with these groups beyond the project lifespan. 

- In addition through the project, there has been a strong attention to regional public engagement - through lectures, media articles and radio contributions. This included an open access public lecture at UWE, Bristol with flood risk professionals and the general public in May 2013. 


4. On-going impact activities

? Targeted knowledge exchange using digital stories: We will report more fully on the ESRC knowledge exchange part of the project later but would like to highlight a few points here. Through our partnership working, there has been knowledge exchange between the academic project team and the professional partners (e.g. discussions around the different languages of engagement with communities when sharing digital stories). We are currently evaluating how the medium and messages in community-generated stories are exchanged in communities, using digital stories as a medium, and also our academic-professional partnership processes. This means that a wider group of organisations and community are engaged with and learning from the project (e.g. Tewkesbury Borough Council - waiving workshop room hire costs on account of the perceived benefits to local communities in terms of flood awareness, and Slough District Council - also involved in a DEFRA Community Pathfinder Project). A key impact is in getting the governance agencies community to realise the significance of narratives in relation to communication with communities and interest constituencies. We have evidence that is beginning to happen through our work with the Environment Agency.

? Work with schools: Our exchange strategy (still on-going) involves preparing a paper for the Journal Geography that is for UK geography teachers to promote our research findings in ways that might inform the schools' curriculum around risk, drawing on local case-studies. We are also sharing, and evaluating the impact of, our digital stories with schools as part of Political Studies Association workshop on 'The Politics of Flooding and Climate Change' at Bath Spa University in December 2014.

? Exchange in other UK Government community resilience initiatives: At regional and levels, we continue to exchange learnings from the ESRC Sustainable Flood Memories project with our regional partners in the Severn catchment but also in other flood risk management settings. For example, experiences in drawing on memory and lay knowledge around flood risk from the project have been shared with local government and the other FRM agencies like the National Flood Forum through the DEFRA Community Pathfinder project to help build community resilience in the Swindon case-study.

? Use of social media for legacy and on-going impact: Our new project website (esrcfloodmemories.ac.uk) is linked to YouTube, Twitter and to other sites (Centre for Floods, Communities and Resilience, UWE). This will hopefully facilitate greater impact amongst a wide age-range, and is being monitored for hits and impact. Our archive of digital stories is accessible both through this site and UWE Bristol's Youtube channel.

? Feed in to other inter-professional research projects that aim to inform strategies to build community resilience: Our research on Sustainable Flood Memory has also informed new research work with other inter-professional research projects e.g. the AHRC 'Towards Hydrocitizenship' project (see www.hydrocitizenship.com) and the RCUK DRY project 'Drought Risk and You' (see www.uwe.ac.uk/research/dry). The project has informed the EPSRC SESAME project (see http://sesame.uk.com) by highlighting the role of digital stories in learning around flood risk response. 

5. Challenges to achieve impact

? One challenge has been the transitory nature of staff deployment to flood risk responsibilities within some partner organisations, particularly in the current climate of financial cutbacks post the 2007 crash. For example, our national contact in the Environment Agency changed several times over the project lifespan. This has required strong inter-professional effort to try and ensure continuity of dialogue for impact. The fact that the ESRC Knowledge Exchange project has been integrated with the ESRC Sustainable Flood Memories project has been important for project legacy. This partnership working with the Environment Agency, County Rural Community Council and Local Government has allowed us the opportunity to reflect on the relationships between flood memory, local knowledge and resilience, but also in how research might be linked to practice in how communities can draw on flood memory to engage around flood risk preparedness through different resilience frames.

? Another area of challenge is the sharing of research/knowledge exchange resources ('captured community voices') with some FRM agencies, when the use of digital technologies (like Youtube) is not allowed in the workplace for some staff. For example, this meant that a webinar we organised for knowledge exchange with community engagement officers in the Environment Agency was only partially successful, and that we have so far been unable to archive our digital stories on the Environment Agency's Youtube channel, as previously planned.

? Linked to the point about working with vulnerable people, there were challenges around public fears of publishing digital stories on the internet, which needed addressing as the project progressed. We will complete a case-study on ethical issues raised by the research for the ESRC as requested for February 2015.

Some of this research on flood memory, lay knowledge and resilience has contributed to thinking about drought memories, lay knowledge and resilience within NERC DRY (Drought Risk and You). NERC DRY is engaging a wide range of stakeholders in its research processes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ED21895B-DAB4-49FB-8CBC-02FA775A7F07</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>547b48a4977795.45509570</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project researched the relationships between flood memory, lay knowledge and resilience in floodplain settings after the 2007 floods.
