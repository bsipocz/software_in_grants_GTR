It will analyse how the material spaces of production (in TV studios and on location) conditioned the aesthetic forms of programmes, and how fictional spaces represented on screen negotiated the opportunities and constraints of studio and exterior space, film and video technologies, and liveness and recording. Specific foci for the research include BBC studios in London and the regions, the sound-stages at Elstree where programmes for ITV were made, and location shooting of drama series and serials in the period. Genres of programme studied include popular drama such as the police and adventure series, science fiction, period costume drama and sitcom. \n\nThe research will involve significant archival work, and will produce a historiography of production spaces in British television and connect this spatial and institutional history with a historiography of television style. Fictional space will be understood as a component of mise-en-scene, where the material space of production impacts on modes of performance, styles of camera work, and the significance of sound environments and visual design. Material spaces of production will be understood as a component of the economic, institutional and political histories of British television, where the availability of production space, its architectural design and resourcing, technologies of camera and sound, and the cultural meanings of these conditions of production changed over time and were negotiated among professional personnel in the television industry.\n\nOne strand of this research concerns the aesthetic specificity of television, in terms of its conventions of spatial representation. Since some of the technologies and practices of representing space were assimilated from cinema (e.g., using film studios, location shooting practices, cameras and directors) the research includes comparative work by one PhD student (Leicester) on the range of production practices and aesthetic codes of mise-en-scene in videotaped and filmed television, where televisual and cinematic conventions were negotiated and in dialogue with each other. The student will study the realisation and representation of space in telefantasy drama, a genre where representations of the alien and familiar, and the past, present and future have been aesthetically and materially significant. Studio-shot television fiction using video technologies was argued to have its own aesthetic, and this debate will be researched by one PhD student (Glamorgan) with a focus on how the changing uses of the studio impacted on the performance styles of actors. One PDRA (Smart, Reading) will trace the detail of resourcing and use of production spaces for programmes, their technologies, production practices and personnel, with a focus on directing practices. The other PDRA (Panos-Horritt, Reading) will focus on theoretical and historiographic debates about the aesthetics and histories of television space, conducting comparative studies across genres, production institutions and periods in order to develop the larger theoretical and methodological framework of the research by means of case studies. The research will include gathering testimony by TV production staff and performers about their experience of spatial opportunities and constraints.\n\nThe project's outcomes will include authoring and joint-authoring journal articles and book chapters. The postdoctoral researchers will be the lead editors of an edited collection of chapters, a journal special issue and the authors of several articles and chapters. The Investigators and PhD students will also publish in these outlets and elsewhere. Outcomes will also include two one-day symposia and one international conference, and engagement with appropriate resource holders and industry audiences. An existing network of academics and archivists (the Southern Broadcasting History Group) will advise on the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will be of value to practitioners and professionals working with broadcasting institutions. Whilst it is always difficult to predict the outcome of historical work, the investigators' previous experience of UK TV research projects is that there is often considerable interest amongst producers and makers of television programmes. Additionally, in analysing the evolving relationships between the material and stylistic spaces of production the research will seek to propose models that can be applied to other contexts and other periods.\n\nThis project is being proposed at a time of considerable disturbance to the ecology of UK television. With the digital switch-over imminent, the development of the technologies of delivery proceeding apace and the restructuring of broadcasting institutions in process, questions about the relationship between space, technology and dramatic form are especially urgent; in this context, learning from television's past is a good way of preparing for its future. There is evidence that broadcasters themselves are interested in a dialogue with academic researchers about both the history and current condition of television. To give one example: the annual conference of the Cyfrwng media research network in Wales is being hosted by BBC Wales in 2009 and is being addressed by its top executives (including the Controller of BBC Wales Cymru).\n\nThe research will be of interest to archivists, since in order to pursue its research questions much of the work will be conducted in archives and will be concerned with relating archival to other kinds of source material. There is emerging interest in opening up archives to researchers and the public. For example, Chapman is currently leading a project at Leicester that has just been awarded an AHRC collaborative doctoral scholarship in association with MACE (Media Archive of Central England) to research the history of ITV regional programming in the Midlands, from 2009-12 (principally news and current affairs).\n\nThe proposed project will seek to engage non-academic users in a range of ways. Where possible, researchers will interview and consult with television professionals involved in production during the period. These interviews will inform the research, but may also be made available as primary sources in their own right, electronically or in written form. The project team will also invite industry practitioners and archivists to its symposia and conference as delegates and participants, and aims to include their contributions in its published outcomes. Published research outcomes will be written to be accessible to industry practitioners as well as a broad academic readership. Timescales are difficult to predict, but the impact on participants and contributors to project events will hopefully be immediate; the impact of published outcomes will be longer term.\n\nAll project members, including PhD students, will be fully involved in the organisation of research events and the networking and organisational skills acquired will be of value in non-academic contexts.\n\nBoth the Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators have experience of running research projects which have engaged with television practitioners and broadcast institutions. An earlier AHRB research project co-directed by Bignell and Lacey which looked at the BBC Wednesday Play and post-War British Drama culminated in a major international conference addressed by some of the leading producers, writers and directors of UK television, many of whom contributed to a subsequent edited collection (Bignell, Lacey and Macmurraugh-Kavanagh 2000). Lacey is currently part of a team researching representations of Wales and 'Welshness' in contemporary BBC drama (especially Doctor Who and Torchwood) in collaboration with BBC Wales Trust. One outcome of the research will be a report to the Trust, wh</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>827429</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leicester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Historical Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>Visual Culture Research: Access All Areas?</gtr:description><gtr:id>C78DB069-6A87-4929-8AD5-10C5AD598D9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration contributed to the employability of research team member Victoria Byard who is now a Lecturer at the UNiversity of Falmouth.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b959e53eb959e55c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Research team member Victoria Byard was a co-organiser of this event.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Visual Culture Research: Access All Areas?' was a one-day research event organised jointly by the University of Leicester's Department of History of Art and Film?s postgraduate seminar group, The Salon, and the Interdepartmental Group for Research into the Arts Media and Society (IDeoGRAMS), in association with the School of Historical Studies. This event considered some of the legal, ethical and moral questions involved in using visual material in an academic context. With the advent and proliferation of digital culture, humanities research has changed forever. In an age when the internet allows access to more and more visual material, much of which has been previously unavailable, academics have an increasingly rich seam of sources to tap into but, inevitably, questions must be asked about the ethics of using sources and research which fall outside the bounds of archives and institutions. At a time when such archives and institutions are also at risk of marginalisation and cuts in funding, should academics use material accessed outside these repositories without questioning its provenance? How may academics and curators negotiate this tension between utopian academic and cultural impulses and the ethical, financial and political constraints around visual culture research, copyright and access? This one-day event explored the use of visual material in academic research and some of the ethical issues that this raises in the digital age. To open up the dialogue beyond academia, speakers from a number of national repositories and archives contributed their thoughts. The speakers were Tim Padfield, Copyright Officer for The National Archives; Murray Weston, Secretary for Film Archives UK; Garry Campbell, Head of Archives Services for the BBC; Philip Claris, Head of Collections Management, The National Trust.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leicester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ethical Choices in Visual Culture Research: an afternoon symposium</gtr:description><gtr:id>0F020317-0E47-4EF4-9FAB-4028C41D6148</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs have been produced.

But as responsible scholars, should we really assume that just because something is available it should be used? For example, what happens if we are unable to establish provenance for the material, or its originator is clearly not the rights holder? What is the legal position and what ethical choices do we face? These are some of the questions with which this seminar engaged. Contributors included Gareth Johnson, Document Supply &amp;amp; Leicester Research Archive Manager, who addressed some of the issues surrounding copyrighted material and fair dealing, and Dr. Natasha Whiteman from the Department of Media and Communications, who discussed the ethical and moral maze we might encounter when using visual media. There was also more general discussion of the topic, which gave attendees an opportunity to raise their own questions. This was a free, interdisciplinary event open to all staff and students who engage with visual material in their work. The afternoon oncluded with a summing up by Professor Kevin Sch&amp;uuml;rer, Pro-Vice-Chancellor with special responsibility for Research and Enterprise at Leicester.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Performance and Television Space</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>482EC45F-3BAA-428D-9913-4986D83FD0EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a blog post reporting the proceedings of the second one-day conference held as part of this research grant project.

In this lecture, Smart argued that the one cardinal virtue, unique to studio drama was the way that it blended space (the expanse of the studio, and the ability to present this studio space, cutting and mixing from different perspectives) and time (the time to watch scenes develop and performers respond to each other in real time). The combination of closeness, the settings in rooms, and rhythm of shots in studio dramas demonstrates how TV studio drama was not so much a muddled hybrid of cinematic and theatrical form, but something rather distinctive, even exciting, in its own right.

Beginning in 2007 as a holiday special, The Sarah Jane Adventures was textually and generically anchored within the wider Doctor Who mythos; however, as an explicitly identified piece of children's programming, its structure and priorities were not necessarily the same as those of its parent text. This paper suggested that the key mechanism for the adaptation of Doctor Who to The Sarah Jane Adventures was the parental role assumed by Sarah Jane Smith, formerly a companion to the Third and Fourth Doctors. This narrative and structural shift re-articulated Doctor Who not just as part of children's television and the Children's BBC brand, in particular, but what Henry Jenkins calls transmedia storytelling. Sarah Jane's shift from isolated 'madwoman' to motherhood generated the 'process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and co-ordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story' (Jenkins, 2011). In the case of The Sarah Jane Adventures, children's television made its own unique contribution to the unfolding text by re-articulating the spaces and anxieties of Doctor Who through the figure of Sarah Jane as mother and through the local and global relationships and responsibilities that result.

Fictional space is understood as a component of mise-en-scene, where the material space of production impacts on modes of performance, styles of camera work, and the significance of sound environments and visual design. Material spaces of production are understood as components of the economic, institutional and political histories of British television, where the availability of production space, its architectural design and resourcing, technologies of camera and sound, and the cultural meanings of these conditions of production changed over time and were negotiated within the television industry.

This blog post is about just one visual strategy used very frequently by director Matthew Robinson in the first episode of EastEnders to do these things by spatial, compositional means. The first episode of EastEnders was broadcast on BBC1 on 19 February 1985. Created by Tony Holland and Julia Smith, the serial is set in the fictional London borough of Walford. It is shot on a purpose-built outside set at Elstree Studios and also interior television studios on the site. The blog post identifies a repeated motif of three-shots (three characters framed in one camera shot) that is used in the first episode to create connections and distinctions between characters in specific places within the fictional world of the programme.

Long before that, Garner's book on the appropriation of the individual, adolescent subjectivities of Gwyn, Alison, and Roger by a repeating mythic pattern was awarded the Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Award, and in 1969 was made into a television series by Granada Television. This paper examined how adolescence is represented and related across the two media of text and television, and also how the boundaries between adolescence and adulthood are destabilised by Garner's use of narrative temporalities. It also investigated how mythopoeia intersects with spaces of nationality, class and gender, and how the approach described by John Ellis as 'textual-historical' can draw out the tensions of the text by relating it to its specific historical context. However through Garner's deliberate trans-historicising of his text through the cyclical and consuming schema of mythology, The Owl Service's standing as a historical text is complicated as are the relationships and concepts of adolescence. Looking beyond the text, the paper argued that Granada used The Owl Service to challenge notions of how programming aimed at younger viewers should be produced and presented. It also suggested that Granada in developing the series pushed the boundaries of programming for children and young adults both in terms of its aesthetic qualities and broadening the appeal of the channel's new weekend output, particularly amongst a growing teenage audience

However, established accounts of British television history have failed to provide a thorough and detailed account of television drama's full and varied reaction to the changes experienced in the police force. The predominant interest in action series shot on film has unfairly skewed historical understandings of British television drama in the 1970s in particular. Using 16mm film cameras on real locations, in series such as The Sweeney (1975- 1978), Law and Order (1978) and The Professionals (1977-83), supposedly shook police procedurals 'out of the &amp;quot;drama documentary&amp;quot; format of slow moving narrative and static camerawork' (Clarke 1992, p. 237). Similarly it is these filmed series that have been lauded for 'not merely &amp;quot;reflecting&amp;quot; what was going on in society at the time but contributing to the formation of ideas about, and attitudes towards, law and order in 1970s Britain' (Cooke 2003, p. 118). However, there were many more series throughout the 1970s that adopted the traditional production practice of utilising video cameras in a studio. New Scotland Yard (1972-1974) is one of these series. Although not as action packed or as fast paced as its contemporaries, here is a series that also contributed to the formation of ideas about and attitudes towards law and order in 1970s Britain. The series occupies an alternative view of the Metropolitan Police Force's modernisation and has gradually been maligned over the years.

We have found that spaces of production (in TV studios designed for multi-camera shooting, and in enclosed sound stages and on location) conditioned the form and visual style of programmes in a range of ways affecting scenic design, performance and shot composition, for example. The fictional spaces represented on screen used the opportunities and constraints of studio and exterior space, film and video technologies, and liveness and recording creatively, exploiting professional competences that we have explored in particular case studies. So, for example, we have investigated how BBC studios in London and the regions were used, and compared this to examples of filmed TV production by commercial ITV companies in sound-stages, and the location shooting of TV drama series and serials by both BBC, ITV and Channel 4. The genres of programme we studied included the police and adventure series, science fiction, soap opera and period costume drama.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is scope to understand British television's audio-visual heritage in terms of space and the representation of interior and exterior places.
