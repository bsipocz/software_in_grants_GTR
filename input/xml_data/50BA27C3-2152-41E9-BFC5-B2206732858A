For example, some evidence suggests that the recent trend towards food products being available in large portion sizes and the omnipresence of tasty food cues in the environment may explain why some people are prone to eating even when they are not in a state of nutritional need. However, a neglected factor in theories of the drivers of obesity is the social context in which eating occurs. While it has been established that eating in a group of friends or family increases consumption at that meal by around 70%, there has been no investigation to date of whether this &amp;quot;social facilitation&amp;quot; of eating results in increased cumulative energy intake over time. Moreover, very little is known about why people tend to eat more when eating with others than when eating alone. The studies proposed here will address these important gaps in the literature by conducting the first systematic examination of the mechanisms that underlie social facilitation of eating and assessing whether these effects are compensated for over time. First, we will establish whether the increase in intake that occurs during a meal eaten with others is compensated for by later reducing intake to balance energy intake. Second, we will conduct a series of studies using laboratory based experimental designs and online survey methods to test the novel hypotheses that social facilitation of eating is explained by 1) the effects of social context on fundamental psychobiological aspects of appetite control and 2) the effects of social context on cognitive decision making that takes place before a meal. By adopting a biopsychosocial approach to understand social eating effects, the present programme of research addresses an ESRC priority (ESRC research investment: biosocial research) and comes under the ESRC strategic priority on health and wellbeing. The results will contribute to theory development in appetite research and to the development of policies regarding advice on healthy eating environments. Overall the results of the proposed studies will enhance understanding of the external drivers of overconsumption and provide novel data on how overeating in social contexts may be avoided.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of this project will be of interest to health professionals and policy makers, the food industry and weight management support groups as well as the general public. Economic and societal impacts include adding to the knowledge base on factors that influence eating behaviour that could later lead to improvements in health and well-being. In particular, the project will provide an evidence base for the development of strategies and advice that can prevent overeating in social situations. Such advice would enable families and other social groups to maintain healthy eating practices while continuing to benefit from social exchanges at mealtimes. In particular, we will work with our project partner Weight Watchers to explore opportunities for translation of the findings. Given the health costs associated with overeating and weight gain it is important to explore new avenues for improving the Nation's diet through developing comprehensive models of appetite control that have implications for advice on diet and eating practices. Wide dissemination of the results (see pathways to impact plan) will ensure that a range of stakeholders are reached and beneficiaries of this project are not be limited to those in the UK. Engagement with the public will enhance understanding of the complexities of appetite control and interactions with the public will be important for improving the quality of research and its impact. It will also ensure wide communication of the results and inspire the next generation of researchers. The work will also contribute to the training of a skilled researcher with wide knowledge and expertise in a range of different experimental approaches to the study of eating behaviour and experience of working in industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>360623</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P01027X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE9084A7-FE6C-4C9D-A9CD-9DE995623422</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>446B7E7F-04EB-4121-9CC6-9171277E00DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diet &amp; health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
