This will be followed by a narratological analysis of the labels and gallery plans of twelve previous exhibitions at the BM between 2001 and 2010, with the aim of tracing the development of interpretation at the BM. As described in the case for support, the empirical work will involve unobtrusive observation of visitors during a visit to a paying exhibition and the free galleries, conducting short and in-depth interviews with individual visitor groups and unobtrusive observation of visitor behaviour in the BM. Visitor conversations around the exhibitions will also be recorded. For the duration of the project, they will work closely with the Interpretation Team at the BM, will meet regularly with the Head of Learning and Audiences (who will be the primary BM supervisor), the BM's Research Manager and the manager of the Interpretation Team, and for an 18-month period will be physically located with members of the Interpretation Team at the BM's offices.\n\nThe BM has a strong interest in interpretation and the classification of its visitors. It first began an interpretation department in 2004 and has since developed its own unique style of object-based interpretation. It was also one of the first museums in the UK to reclassify its visitors from demographics to identity-based motivations. \n\nThe award-holder would therefore benefit from the substantial degree of interest and commitment that BM staff already have to thinking about the issues and context of this proposed project. The BM also recognise that the opportunity to undertake more structured academic research on these questions, in collaboration with specialists in the study of visitor meaning-making and narrative-construction, will provide an important opportunity for the development of their own knowledge and interests. The award-holder will also benefit from the close, collaborative relationship between the PI and the BM staff involved in this project, which has developed through a number of meetings over an 18 month period prior to the submission of this proposal.\n\nIn addition to this broader context of shared interest in this project between UCL Institute of Archaeology (IOA) and the BM, and the wider experience and expertise of BM staff in this area, there are also specific practical benefits arising from the collaborative nature of the project. Through working with the Interpretation Team it will be possible to negotiate access to conduct visitor research in the museum's galleries, including liaising with gallery staff about arrangements for audio-recording at specific times. \n\nMore generally, this collaboration with the BM offers the potential for an innovative exchange of knowledge between BM staff with expertise in museum visitor research and the PI and award-holder's awareness of current theoretical developments in the field of narratology, which will generate new theoretical and empirical insights. The BM's Interpretation Team has an international profile in developing new approaches to museum evaluation, as well as substantial expertise in a range of evaluation methods. Collaboration with the Interpretation Team therefore offers significant potential for clarifying how concepts from the study of narrative, further refined through the empirical element of this project, might help to inform new ways of evaluating visitor experiences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This CDA is directly intended to assist museums and galleries better understand their visitors and how to improve the design and nature of the exhibitions and galleries they create. The wide range of presentations, publications and two end of project seminars outlined in the Case for Support reflect how disseminating the results of this result is seen as an integral part of the CDA itself.\n\nThere will be a direct benefit to the British Museum as this CDA will build on and analyse in greater detail the results of its own evaluation of its visitors - an area where it spends c.&amp;pound;50,000 a year. It will help develop new approaches to visitor evaluation and, crucially, feed into how the Museum will plan its future exhibitions and galleries. These exhibitions not only generate income for the Museum and help support its cultural diplomacy on behalf of the UK, they also contribute a considerable amount to the London economy through the spending of visitors in hotels, transport, food etc. (especially as a significant proportion of exhibition goers now come from outside London and the UK). It will also support the growing emphasis on research and collaboration with University partners in the BM's Interpretation team, building on another successful CDA with Birkbeck. Having a current member of the Interpretation team undertake this CDA will ensure greater integration and application of the results of the research.\n\nThe potential impact on exhibition and gallery design and experience is of importance to all museums, not just the BM. New exhibitions and galleries form the key role in how museums interacts with their audiences and achieve their different aims. They also represent very considerable expenditure, often requiring substantial sponsorship. Improving how exhibitions and galleries 'work' is therefore crucial for the BM and other museums - and their contribution to the UK economy.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I023848/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
