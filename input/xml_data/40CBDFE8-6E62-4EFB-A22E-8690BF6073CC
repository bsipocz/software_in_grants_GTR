At the same time, 'fit' male bodies are often surrounded by myths and stereotypes, viewed as vain and unintelligent and communicating hegemonic masculinity. Male embodiment is a confusing territory. How are men today, especially young men whose identities are still in formation, meant to inhabit, work on, and identify with their bodies? Academic efforts to theorize men's fitness have been overly reductive and limited by their focus on verbal and visual accounts of fitness, rather than how a sporting body thinks, acts, and feels. The ambitious goal of this fellowship is to reconceive our understanding of the relationship between physical fitness and masculine gender construction. It aims to reframe the fit and sporting male body as a site for the production of 'new', alternative, and inclusive masculinities; where old identities and new social formations are contested and 'worked out.' Accordingly it supports a programme of research that investigates fitness as performance, thereby developing a new theoretical paradigm and making a significant contribution to performance studies, gender studies, and sociology of sport.

Through an innovative and interdisciplinary Performance Studies methodology grounded in ethnographic fieldwork and artistic practice-as-research, the project will offer a new understanding of physical fitness as embodied knowledge. Understanding fitness as performance reveals connections between the cultural performance of the fit male body in theatre, film, and other media, and the everyday performative acts of fitness in the gym and in the everyday world. Performance also provides a medium for practitioners, artists, and the public to explore the embodied knowledge of fitness through participation in its techniques. 

A new understanding of men's fitness is crucial today when both masculinity and public health are important social issues, in order to offer an urgently needed corrective to over-simplified portrayals of 'masculinity in crisis.' The research will demonstrate in what way fitness is crucial to the performance and construction of the whole spectrum of modern masculinities, including non-normative, queer, and trans masculinities. It will provide new insights into the complex lived experience of men's fitness to reassess how it can promote healthy masculinities, alongside the public goods of wellbeing, friendship, and community. 

The fellowship comprises a 6-month period of archival and secondary research, a 12-month period of fieldwork and creative practice-as-research, and a 6-month period of writing and dissemination leading to outputs including a monograph, three journal articles, and a series of performances. A programme of impact and leadership activities such as networking events, international symposium, applied drama workshop for teenage boys, and publicly focused articles for popular websites will champion performance and theatre studies as a key interdisciplinary methodology for masculinities research, and will set-up a research community engaged with the intersections of art and sport, with the aim of devising future collaborative projects with innovative new research methodologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Dynamic Tensions will have significant impact among non-academic beneficiaries. As its primary aim is to create new understandings of the relation between gender identities and bodily practices, it will benefit young men, fitness professionals, and the general public by engaging these groups in discussions on contemporary masculinities and transforming ideas of 'what a man is' by showing the plurality of masculine identities today. Through a series of focused leadership activities it will also provide opportunities for networking among academics, artists, and fitness industry professionals, leading to innovative future projects that bridge the gap between academic research, artistic practice, and the fitness industry.

The project will engage young men of secondary school and university age with the research directly, through a series of workshops leading to a performance exploring masculinities, sport/exercise, and body image. Using an applied drama methodology, I will work with a group of young men to provide a space for storytelling and dialogue on identity and the body. Working with heads of drama and physical education in a London boys' school, the project will model a method for 'teaching gender' in schools and facilitate interdisciplinary working through its combination of dramaturgical techniques and physical exercise. While this impact activity is intended to have significant impact upon a small group of young men, a PDF resource pack will be produced enabling the performance to be delivered by other teachers and facilitators.

The project will benefit fitness professionals by enabling them to take part directly in a creative practice that reimagines and recontextualises their daily activities, embodied practices, and life histories, thereby prompting critical reflection. Staged as part of an existing high-profile venue/festival (discussions have taken place with the coordinator of the Arts and Humanities Festival at King's College London), the performance exhibition will also enable the general public to explore questions of the embodiment of masculinity in a highly accessible way. Audience feedback in the form of post-show discussion and survey will capture the responses of the public to the research. Post-performance roundtables will enable participants to discuss their creative choices with the public. This creative representation of fitness and the ensuing dialogue will be transformative because it will reframe perceptions of fitness from an exclusive practice to an inclusive one. In addition, the project will make substantial use of social networking media to reach non-academic research users. Online social networking, especially the photo/video sharing application Instagram, is a key site of performance for fitness professionals (including trainers, weightlifters, bodybuilders, and fitness models). Dynamic Tensions will make use of Instagram and Twitter to document and disseminate the research process. The website for the project will post news, blogs, and short articles, and media activities with relevant websites such as The Good Men Project and Breaking Muscle are planned.

Finally, the project will develop a research network in art, sport, and performance. This initiative will engage non-academic audiences such as artists and performers, and fitness professionals, with researchers in performance and theatre studies, sports studies, and gender studies. More importantly, through a series of network meetings culminating in an interdisciplinary symposium open to all, this initiative will also provide valuable networking opportunities for academic and non-academic end-users and consolidate an emerging field in art/performance and sport.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159045</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N005805/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA5B898B-8204-4E59-97AB-DA2B10124EED</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; Theatre - Other</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6C41006C-514B-4763-BE82-812123897818</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
