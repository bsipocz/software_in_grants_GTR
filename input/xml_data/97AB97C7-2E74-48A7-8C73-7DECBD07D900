Helene Cixous and Jacques Derrida are two of the most original and influential thinker-writers of our times. They were close friends since their student days as well as being intellectual and political allies from the outset of their respective careers, and although they have each written several major pieces on the other's work, these interviews constitute the only extended public dialogue between them. Theirs is indeed a unique example of intellectual companionship, spanning some forty years. Their exchange became an ever more insistent theme in their own work towards the end of Derrida's life, and it is attracting growing interest amongst scholars in the field. The importance of their relationship stands as more than simply a biographical curiosity concerning two influential intellectual figures. For each of them, and in quite different ways, the other's work represents a vital counterpoint and resonance chamber for their own. Cixous is one of a small group of poetic writers who became profound inspirations in Derrida's work. Yet Cixous's writing is not used by Derrida simply to illustrate certain aspects of his deconstructive project; it acts rather as a goad and a challenge, obliging him to go further in his thinking, 'another step too far', as he says, quoting her. And likewise for Cixous, while Derrida's writing has indeed served as an example of what she once called 'ecriture feminine', and his thinking is a constant reference for her own theoretical work, Derrida 'himself' (as man, as character, as body of work) has become one of her elected 'guides' in her fiction writing.
The aim of the conversations was not to propose another introductory reiteration of their theories, positions or trajectories, but rather to provoke an amicable event which would itself take its place in the long history of their exchanges. The pretext and the general theme of the event was thus a mutual, broad-ranging reflection on their relationship and its implications in their lives and works. Over the past two decades I have worked closely with both Cixous and Derrida on various projects, notably involving translations. As a long-term acquaintance, I was able to propose a rather informal frame for the interviews, giving them an unusual tone, both conversational and critical, mixing scholarly exposition, technical debate and self-&amp;shy; reflexive narration in such a way that the personal, the political and the theoretical cannot be disentangled. The book promises therefore to be an important addition to the growing field, offering new insights on the thinking and writing of these two authors.
However the interviews need to be transcribed and then carefully edited. This will include a substantial critical apparatus, because many of the themes and problematic referred to in passing during the conversations need to be introduced and explicated in notes and/or text inserts. Helene Cixous has agreed to participate actively in the editing process; Derrida's estate supports the project and the French publishing house Galilee {who publish most of Derrida's work and much of Cixous's) are eager to publish the book. Galilee and Cixous would like the book to include a significant number of illustrations: this material must be identified and prepared for publication. In addition, I will write a substantial introduction to the volume, situating and contextualising the interviews, drawing out certain critical issues raised in the exchange. Once the French edition has been established, I will prepare the English translation. I have discussed the project with several English-language editors, and am confident that it will receive an enthsiastic response.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22161</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D501695/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>67D06C0B-53E4-47FE-8186-CBCE56A1271E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
