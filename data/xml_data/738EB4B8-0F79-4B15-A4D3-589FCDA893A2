The academic team (historian Dr Fearghal McGarry and film studies specialist Professor Desmond Bell) will work with the independent film and television company(Glass Machine Productions), broadcaster(TG4) and a regional film festival and gallery (Belfast Film Festival/Belfast Exposed) to produce and exhibit a feature length documentary film. The film is based on the published research of Dr McGarry ('Frank Ryan',Dublin 2010) and explores the life of republican activist and International Brigade volunteer, Frank Ryan (1902-1944). The project involves a series of festival screenings and workshop discussions, with website support, to accompany the television broadcast of the completed film. Through this multimedia strategy we aim to maximise the knowledge transfer impact of McGarry's research in the specific context of post-conflict Northern Ireland. This project explores a set of issues concerned with the relationship between academic history, factual film-making and the public communication of historical understanding in a divided society. In what ways does the approach of film-makers differ from the orthodox writing of history? What are the specific responsibilities of KT transfer of historical research in N.I.? We seek to add research value to the documentary film being produced and to reach a popular audience in N.I. - though potentially on a much wider basis - through television broadcast, webcast and cinema exhibition. The evidence is that the general public increasingly get their historical information from broadcast and film sources. But, is the historical documentary a populist form which necessarily involves the 'dumbing down' of academic history? On the other hand, can the inclusion of historical documentary material within the television schedule extend access to historical understanding to a broader range of people than the specialist texts of academic,written history? Our project proceeds from the assumption that to maximise the effectiveness of documentary film as a mode of knowledge transfer of historical understanding that we need to forge more effective partnerships between academic researchers, broadcasters and their audience.\n Frank Ryan's life remains an enigma. This teenage IRA volunteer, anti-treaty 'Irregular' in the Civil War, dissident republican socialist in 1930s Dublin, and International Brigade volunteer who fought fascism in the Spanish civil war ended his life working for the Nazis in wartime Berlin. The historical record is incomplete. Ideological disputes have further obscured our understanding of the man. For some in Ireland and across Europe he remains an icon -an Irish republican who embraced an international cause in Spain. His activities in Germany as a guest of the German intelligence services are quietly put aside. For others, Ryan's activities and very presence in Hitler's Berlin exemplify the reactionary character of militant nationalism and its willingness to compromise with fascism, while also raising serious questions about Ireland's neutrality during the Second World War. These remain live issues in Ireland. \n While our film seeks to be attentive to the latest historical research on Ryan and Ireland during the Second World War, it draws upon the imaginative resources of the creative documentary to encourage an interrogation of history in a society where historical narrative is often divisive. It explores a human story of tragic proportions with a mass audience for whom the story has a continuing resonance in the context of the current political dispensation in Northern Ireland. The project seeks to elaborate a model of good interdisciplinary practice to guide future collaborations between historians, filmmakers, broadcasters and their audience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The following users and beneficiaries of the research involved in this project can be identified:\n\n* the production company we are collaborating with and more generally the independent film and television sector in Northern Ireland. The former benefits from a direct input of academic expertise in the origination, development and delivery of the pilot film project; the latter in the availability of a model of collaborative practice to be drawn upon to guide them in effective use of academic experts and of their research expertise in television documentary production.\n\n* the 'third sector' in Northern Ireland and, in particular, a range of film festivals and galleries who will host the exhibition of the work and the audience workshop activity. They will be able to draw upon a range of interpretative experience and multimedia support to grow target audiences, including the audience for Irish-language films and programmes\n\n* the broadcaster TG4 who wish to broadcast historically-informed documentary films based on original research and who also welcome festival screening of work with opportunities to guage audience reaction to work, particularly in the Irish language. In addition the broadcaster has particular interest in the multi-platform delivery of historical documentary content and in the results of a pilot scheme using website delivery alongside traditional broadcast.\n\n* professional or practitioner groups in Northern Ireland concerned with peace and reconciliation work and the role of historical understanding in this and in the development of more general models of civic education.\n\n* the Irish language community in Northern Ireland which will have a quality historical documentary film made available to it in an area of historical interest likely to engage that community. The provision of a website with language support elements and of workshops catering for Irish speakers will facilitate cultural education goals.\n\n* the general public in Northern Ireland who have access to an important documentary film and to the various related fora supported by the project; these discussions will feed into more general processes of historical understanding and inter-communal communication.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>103898</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>72 minute creative documentary film. Frank Ryan's life (born Limerick 1902, died Dresden 1944) remains an enigma. The teenage IRA volunteer, dissident republican and Spanish International Brigade volunteer, ended his life working for the Nazis in wartime Berlin. How could this be? Our film employs the imaginative resources of the creative documentary to explore a human story of truly tragic proportions. We harness the power of the archival image in play with dramatic live action to to draw a contemporary audience into the core story centred on Ryan's split loyalties. From an apartment in war ravaged Berlin Ryan reflects on his life sharing his story with a young radio producer. After a failed attempt to return to Ireland by U Boat together with the head of the IRA, Ryan becomes trapped in Berlin. The contradiction between his political beliefs and his dependence on Nazi hospitality comes to haunt him. Drawing upon Ryan's letters and journalism we have fashioned a film which illuminates the enigma that was Frank Ryan. Scheduled for broadcast winter 2013.

The conference provided a forum to explore the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration between historians, film-makers and broadcasters concerned with the public communication of historical understanding in Ireland as we approach the 'decade of centenaries'. 

Proceeding from the assumption that to maximise the potential of film to facilitate historical understanding, we need to forge more effective partnerships between historians, media scholars, film-makers and broadcasters, the conference addressed the following themes:

- the public commemoration of history in Ireland and the role of filmed history in post-conflict reconciliation

- notions of authority, objectivity and balance in television history in Ireland

- the engagement of the documentary film with personal testimony, collective memory and communal myth 

- the use of archive and found footage in historical documentaries and the differing ways historians and film makers approach this 'data' as both evidential and expressive source

This project involved an interdisciplinary collaboration between a historian and a documentary film-team around the making and exhibition of a feature-length documentary film on the life of Irish republican Frank Ryan (1902-1944). The academic team (historian Fearghal McGarry and film-maker Desmond Bell) collaborated with an independent film and television company (Glass Machine Productions), an Irish broadcaster (TG4) and a regional film festival (Belfast Film Festival) to produce and exhibit a feature-length documentary film on Ryan. 

The project's objectives were as follows:
? To exploit the knowledge transfer potential of documentary film by means of a 'live collaborative project'. 
? To maximize the effectiveness of the knowledge transfer process by providing interpretative support for the reception of the film via festival screenings and workshops and a dedicated interpretive website.
? To delineate a model of good practice for the collaboration of documentary film makers, historians, production companies and broadcasters. 
? To explore a range of research questions about how historians relate to the popular media, and the differing modes of narration employed by film makers and academic historians to share these insights with a popular audience.
? To explore the role of the documentary film in the critical interrogation of history and in post-conflict reconciliation, in particular the role of Irish language sector in this social pedagogy.

The project's key activities and outcomes included:

? Producing a full-length creative documentary for cinema exhibition and television broadcast.
? Organising a series of screenings, premiering at the Jameson Dublin International Film Festival in February 2012 and subsequently at the Irish Film Institute and Belfast Film Festivals. These were accompanied by panel or audience workshop discussions (in association with the journal History Ireland), generating television, press and radio media coverage.
? Developing an interpretive website.
? Organising a conference, Reframing History: film, television and the historians, to provide a forum to explore the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration between historians, film-makers and broadcasters.


Key impacts included:
? Through our development of a practice-based analysis to explore how scholarly history is disseminated through film, our project elaborated a model of good practice between historians, film-makers and broadcasters which has been disseminated through publication in scholarly and industry journals. Our project demonstrated the potential of KT projects to forge effective partnerships between academics and broadcasters, both to facilitate the commissioning of historical documentaries, and to strengthen their ability to extend historical understanding to a mass audience. An independent television producer described the project as an example of 'the historians taking the initiative towards the medium', and a pioneering model of the potential of KTP's to build links between historians and the creative industries.
? Our project has had a significant societal impact through cultural engagement. The Enigma of Frank Ryan has been viewed by several thousand people at international film festivals, community festivals, and other public events. Audience sampling demonstrates the film's impact. In an audience survey following a screening at the Foyle Film Festival, 57% of the respondents answered positively when asked 'Did watching this film change the way you think about the history of Irish republicanism?', while ninety per cent of the respondents judged the film to have contemporary significance.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E0323512-763D-453F-A900-74D24AFB6ECA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5449275d70e258.54076922</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key Findings

We offer these conclusions based on our inter-disciplinary collaboration with the aim of providing a tentative model of good practice to guide other scholars, film-makers and industry practitioners working in the field of film and history.
 
1. It is important from the outset for film-maker and historian to realize that they are operating within very different cultural and institutional milieu with different professional interests at work. This means mutual respect for each other's methodologies and an understanding of the difference, for example, between the worlds of a university and that of an independent film company working within a commercial environment. We have much to learn from each other. We can call this the mutual respect principle.
2. Narrowly defined, 'knowledge transfer' seems a problematic way of conceptualising interdisciplinary collaboration between historians, film-makers and production companies/broadcasters. Meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration, on the other hand, requires collaboration from the earliest possible stage of production, something which innovative, flexible knowledge-transfer-type schemes can play a vital role in supporting. Genuine collaboration should start from the assumption that each party is 'doing history', albeit it in different ways. Rather than seeing film as a second-rate form of history due to its inability to reproduce the complexity and nuance of historical scholarship on screen, historians should accept that film-makers operate to a different set of rules, material restrictions and communicational imperatives. Let's call this the parity of historiographical esteem principle.
3. Historians who wish to engage with history on film should become more acquainted with the production process. This will not necessarily make them more forgiving with regards to the elisions and compromises of the film-maker, but it will give them a better understanding of the formal features of filmic storytelling, the primacy of creative decisions for the film-maker, and how the pressures of production can determine creative decisions and attention to historical verisimilitude. Conversely, film-makers would be well advised not only to familiarise themselves with the secondary literature on their subject but to have engaged with the documentary basis of these studies and reached some understanding of the methods of academic historians: the appreciative understanding principle.
4. In 'doing history', film-makers and historians - who share more in common than might appear - should reflect on the complementary nature of their skills and aims. Film's dramatic appeal, its storytelling and visual qualities, and its ability engage on an emotional level can vastly extend the reach and impact of historical knowledge. Historians should develop their capacity to exploit and interpret visual sources, particularly moving and still-image archive, not simply for their illustrative qualities but also for their evidential value. They might also demonstrate greater awareness of the use of film archive in a figurative manner by film-makers. Conversely, film-makers - who tell stories primarily through images rather than words - have much to learn from historians in terms of embedding context, analysis and competing interpretations within their narratives: the acknowledgment of complementary aims.
5. Historians have a valuable role to play in the reception of historical films whether through post-screening debates, interpretative websites or other means of providing the historical context, detail and nuance that a film cannot. Such resources offer a means of addressing the compromises necessitated by the historical film which might be regarded not as the end product but as an opportunity to promote a more meaningful public engagement with history. This might be called the principle of promoting an expanded communication field for historical understanding.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our finding were developed as part of a follow-on AHRC project, 'Documentary film, public history and education in Northern Ireland (AH/K002775/1).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>62560271-B88B-4431-B2BA-2A75FC39D1E7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544927eb4f0067.78198268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/frankryan/FilmandtheCommunicationofHistoricalKnowledge/TheEnigmaofFrankRyan/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9DAAA720-9D6B-4F2A-B508-7FD7B9603156</gtr:id><gtr:title>Documentary in a Changing State: Ireland Since the 1990s</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/46e6049aeb84cb240fd3fbbd6291cbb2"><gtr:id>46e6049aeb84cb240fd3fbbd6291cbb2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>MacKeogh, Carol; O'Connell, Diog</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781859184912</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-5733717582.8718753bcaac2a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I026626/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
