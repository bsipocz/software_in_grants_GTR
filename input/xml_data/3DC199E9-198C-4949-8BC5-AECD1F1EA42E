Approximately 60-70 representatives of these organisations attended the meeting and the OHP slides used were subsequently circulated to all members of the mailing list.

This is the third event and the focus was to present the early findings of the sub-projects 1, 2 and 3 (historical, non-graduates and graduates). 36 participants registered along with the research team. The event generated considerable discussion which informed the research. 

Four presentations reporting emerging findings were presented by members of the research team, one on each of the four sub-projects, and each of these was followed by comments from an invited leading regional practitioner.
