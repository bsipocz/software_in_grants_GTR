There are a number of components of the immune system. CD4 T cells secrete signals that help other cells control microorganism numbers. CD4 T cells are normally resting but when the cell detects a foreign object, it changes into one of a number of different types of effector cell, each of which activates a different component of the immune response. The type of effector cell it becomes depends on the type of foreign object detected and allows the immune response to tailor itself to different threats. It is also important that the appropriate balance between these different effector types is maintained because excessive activation can lead to allergies (excessive responses to harmless substances) or autoimmune diseases (responses against the body).

The changes a T cell undergoes when it detects a foreign object are controlled by transcription factors, proteins which bind to specific sites on DNA and turn on and off near-by genes. Development of different effector cell types is directed by different transcription factors. The research field did believe that only one type of factor was turned on at any time, giving the cell clear directions on what cell type to become. But more recently, a number of research groups have shown that T cells can contain more than one type of factor, potentially pulling the cell in two different directions at once or allowing the cell to switch between effector types. The interplay between the two factors when both are present, for example whether one is dominant over the other or whether the cell adopts characteristics driven by both factors, is unclear but is important to understand how T cells tailor the immune response and how the balance between different effector types is maintained. 

We have found that when two important T cell transcription factors are present in the same cell, one acts dominantly over the other, blocking its ability to control genes. This suggests that a cell can hedge its bets over the cell type it is to become, following the instructions of the dominant factor but maintaining the potential to switch to the other factor. We will identify the mechanism through which one factor acts dominantly over the other and determine its importance for the control of gene activity, development of the appropriate immune response and for a healthy balance between different T cell effector types. This will open new avenues for research that will lead to the ability to block unwanted cellular activities and eventually allow one cell type to be turned into another for regenerative medicine or therapies to boost immunity or target cancers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Understanding the process of T helper cell differentiation and how the balance between different lineages is controlled is a key challenge facing immunology and will provide insight into other cell specification processes. CD4+ helper T cells respond to antigen and cytokine cues by differentiating into one of a number of specialised effector lineages, each specified by a different master regulator. It has recently become apparent that these lineages are plastic and cells can switch phenotype. This is reflected by the frequent co-expression of lineage-specific transcriptional regulators but how co-expression modulates their function, and how this regulates cell differentiation and plasticity is poorly understood. 

We have recently discovered that the Th1 lineage master regulator T-bet can redistribute the Th2 regulator Gata3 away from its canonical binding sites at Th2 genes and sequester it at Th1 sites. We hypothesise that this novel mechanism allows lineage-specification to proceed whilst maintaining a degree of developmental plasticity. This mechanism may also underlie interactions between other pairs of transcription factors in T cells and other cell types. 

Here, we propose to identify the mechanism through which Gata3 redistribution takes place and to assess its significance for T cell differentiation and plasticity. 

We will use a combination of cellular immunology and genomics techniques that benefit from the long-standing and productive collaboration between the Jenner and Lord groups. The underlying mechanism will be identified in an in vitro model and its effect on epigenetic modification, gene activity, cell differentiation and plasticity determined both in vitro and in vivo.

This work will define a new paradigm for the interplay between lineage-specifying factors, which likely operates in other cell types and developmental and homeostatic systems. Such a mechanism could be harnessed to regulate lineage balance and for cell reprogramming.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Fit with BBSRC Strategic Priorities: This work will identify a fundamental cellular regulatory mechanism that underpins normal cell homeostasis and health (Priority 3). Understanding how T cel plasticity is regulated is key to maintaining immune system function in old age and for attempts to harness cell plasticity for regenerative medicine approaches. Our combination of cellular immunology with cutting-edge genomics and bioinformatics methods are core to BBSRC Enabling Theme 2: Exploiting new ways of working.

Public sector: Understanding the mechanisms that underpin the maintenance of a healthy immune system has potentially huge impacts across the NHS and the social care sector. If it is possible to develop a biomarker or an intervention associated with this phenotype, then this would be of great importance. The project has the potential to identify a mechanism that underlies the homeostatic balance between Th1 and Th2 lineages that could be utilised to correct disorders that arise when this balance is lost. Such disorders are a significant burden to the NHS. This research will also identify the mechanism by which one transcription factor can override another to reprogram cell state. This will impact attempts to alter cell phenotypes for adoptive cell transfer and stem cell therapies. We are well placed to translate mechanistic findings into relevant impacts as this project is taking place in the context of both the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at UCH/UCL. In these environments, we are well placed to contribute to multidisciplinary programmes in epidemiology and health and social care research. This will ensure that useful discoveries are rapidly translated for maximum societal benefit.

Industry: Manipulation of transcription factor function holds therapeutic promise. Although complicated by large protein-protein interfaces and a general lack of hydrophobic pockets, therapies that target transcription factors are now in development. Identification of T-bet-Gata3 interaction surfaces and defining the consequences of this interaction for cell phenotype will be an important step in this direction. Interventions designed to maintain healthy immunity, which, whilst some way off, would be of significant interest to UK industry. There are very few pharmacological interventions that are likely to be of benefit to the general population. As one of them, this work has the potential for substantial economic impact. 

General public: Understanding how to measure healthy immunity at all stages of life would benefit the general public in many ways. As a specific example of this, it may be possible to enhance the efficacy of vaccinations, which would be of significant public health impact. The work may also lead to interventions that would enhance immunity in the aged by promoting plasticity in the declining T cell repertoire.

Societal impact: Being able to address the issues of healthy immunity and the more general aspects of this in relation to societal functions would enhance the awareness of the general population to this aspect of normal human physiology that is generally overlooked. This could have important ramifications as to how society perceives the value of fundamental mechanistic research as it relates to their health and wellbeing.

Skills development: This grant will directly lead to the training of two staff members. Staff will gain expertise in cutting-edge cellular immunology and genomics research areas that will expand the skills base of the UK. As is often the case, the combination of diverse research skills will likely lead to further discoveries and technological advances as this expertise is propagated though the workforce. Staff will also gain training in skills transferable to the wider economy, including time management, communication, presentation, IT and programming and university teaching.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>132710</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2F78D98D-3F81-42B4-8857-130564F3F604</gtr:id><gtr:title>T-bet as a key regulator of mucosal immunity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/47f35f946f30921891c7358065bf53e2"><gtr:id>47f35f946f30921891c7358065bf53e2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mohamed R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0019-2805</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d545cc64022.76873041</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BAFF12D7-C398-4812-A85F-0DD7EA258327</gtr:id><gtr:title>Genetic variants alter T-bet binding and gene expression in mucosal inflammatory disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLoS genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0ccf9faaa1f42b507e4b9de00b98315c"><gtr:id>0ccf9faaa1f42b507e4b9de00b98315c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Soderquest K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1553-7390</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c7c9ee835972.82609503</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1B75EE05-1FE3-484E-8E94-AC6715D0F322</gtr:id><gtr:title>T-bet Activates Th1 Genes through Mediator and the Super Elongation Complex.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cell reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e2a70b861c9ef430a92720e545afc638"><gtr:id>e2a70b861c9ef430a92720e545afc638</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hertweck A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d67d2ad9fa6.77343770</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L010356/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CC10CC12-1D16-48BD-8F66-6A64A651DEAB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gene action &amp; regulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
