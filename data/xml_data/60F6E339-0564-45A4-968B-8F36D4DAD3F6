The combination of unprecedented experimental control and the quantum many-body nature of these systems makes them an ideal way to create &amp;quot;quantum simulators&amp;quot;: configurable test systems that reproduce complex phenomena for study under controlled conditions. They are also at the forefront of progress towards future quantum sensing and computing technologies. One of the most notable phenomena accessible to these experiments is the Bose-Einstein condensate: a state of matter in which bosonic (integer spin) atoms enter a collective quantum state, becoming a single wave-like entity. These condensates display the remarkable property of superfluidity, flowing indefinitely without resistance. In displaying superfluidity, they are similar to low temperature liquid Helium, which also enters a superfluid state containing a Bose-Einstein condensate, but the atomic condensates have the advantage that they can be experimentally measured and manipulated at a microscopic, quantum level.

At the heart of the so-called dirty boson problem is a simple question: how do interacting bosons behave when we put them in a random disordered environment? This can be investigated by pouring liquid Helium into a porous substance like aerogel, but this system is difficult to study directly on a microscopic footing. Instead, cutting-edge experiments can realise the dirty boson problem can by creating atomic condensates in disordered potentials made using laser light; this can be thought of as putting the bosons in a random hilly landscape. The core of the dirty boson problem is the competition between the bosons' natural tendency to form a condensate at the lowest point in the landscape, and the interactions' tendency to push the bosons further apart. This competition generates a rich equilibrium phase diagram, with normal, superfluid and exotic Bose-glass phases.

However, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dirty bosons remain relatively unexplored. As well as being of fundamental theoretical interest, a better understanding of the dynamics of dirty bosons will help optimize future experiments using atomic condensates for quantum sensing or information processing. This research project will address these questions by creating new theoretical and numerical techniques to study the out-of-equilibrium dirty boson problem in atomic condensates. We will investigate what happens dynamically when dirty bosons undergo a phase transition, and what happens when a flow of dirty bosons becomes turbulent.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Ultracold quantum gases provide a platform for highly controllable and precise manipulation of many-body quantum systems on a microscopic level. The non-equilibrium dynamics of these systems are of great inherent interest, falling within the remit of the EPSRC Grand Challenge Theme &amp;quot;Emergence and Physics Far From Equilibrium&amp;quot;. All the research objectives of the proposed project will contribute significantly and directly to knowledge in this area. In particular, the question of out-of-equilibrium behaviour of bosons in a disordered potential (so-called dirty bosons) is a challenging theoretical issue which our new methods will shed new light on. 

Our research will also directly address the question of whether, and to what extent, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism of topological defect formation continues to apply in ultracold dirty boson systems. The role of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in ultracold clean boson systems has been significantly explored, theoretically and experimentally, over the last ten years; our results extending this line of enquiry to the dirty boson case will yield knowledge that benefits the broad academic community in this field. Our results on superfluid flow through disordered potentials will have impact in the broader academic community working on quantum fluids and quantum turbulence, who we will address and keep updated on our results via the UK Fluids &amp;quot;Quantum Fluids Special Interest Group&amp;quot;.

In addition to being of theoretical interest, understanding the nature of topological defect formation during phase transitions is of key relevance in optimizing implementations of quantum simulation algorithms, such as quantum annealing, so the light shed by our work in this area will impact on the economy through its contribution to the EPSRC Grand Challenge Theme &amp;quot;Quantum Physics for New Quantum Technologies&amp;quot;. Similarly, our work on superfluid flow through disordered potentials will be highly relevant to emerging experiments in the field of atomtronics. More broadly, by introducing new methods and gaining new knowledge in these particular areas, we will contribute to the experimental drive towards the end goal of usable, practical quantum devices for measurement, sensing, simulation and computing. Reaching such a goal will ultimately have profound societal and economic impact. We will ensure our results reach the broad experimental community and contribute to our academic impact through attendance at major atomic physics conferences.

A key element of our proposal is to ensure that the numerical codes we develop are made available to other researchers. This will have the beneficial impact of promoting further development, and wider uptake, of the new numerical methods we develop, by lowering a key barrier to further research in the field. These codes will also be used to generate societal impact, as we will provide suggested &amp;quot;student projects&amp;quot; involving use of the codes that could be used for independent or group study work in higher education. We will also maintain a jargon-free &amp;quot;visualization of the month&amp;quot; web page, showcasing our research to the general public. Our work will also further enhance the strong international reputation of the Joint Quantum Centre Durham-Newcastle for research in the field of ultracold quantum gases. The project will also generate impact on the economy via the training of the post-doctoral researcher and the collaborating PhD student. Both individuals will gain high-level skills in physics, mathematics and computing, as well as communication and collaborative skills. By working closely with the PhD student, the post-doctoral researcher will gain important supervision and management experience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101015</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R021074/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B0D65A04-1D90-417F-9589-EA58474E36E3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cold Atomic Species</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
