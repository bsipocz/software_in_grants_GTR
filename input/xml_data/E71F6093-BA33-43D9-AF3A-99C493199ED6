Like others in London, all three were swept up in the powerful surge of interest in print and book production that marked the early twentieth century, a legacy of the late Victorian interest in print reform and the growing fame of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Throughout the 1920s, debates raged on the qualities of type, layout and design, igniting profound questions about ideal form and the political and social capacity of the book as a tool of communication, engagement and education: as the political landscape of Europe shifted throughout the 1930s and 1940s, such debates took on increasingly politicised forms. In the cases of Rodker, Cunard and Reavey, their passion for bookmaking and print was matched with a fascination for contemporary French art, in particular that of the new Surrealist avant-garde: each had strong connections with Paris, the epicentre of European modernism; each was highly sympathetic to the Marxist theory that underpinned the Surrealist movement; each was aware of and interested in the French tradition of the livre d'artiste, a key genre of Surrealist production. Study of their activities and work thus provides a valuable insight into the intersection of national traditions, as well as the beginnings of British Surrealism. \n\nOne of the 'Whitechapel boys', Rodker is a pivotal but under-researched figure in British modernism. A translator, poet and editor, driven by a passion for French literature and culture, his early imprints were motivated by a desire to print by hand and to work with young artists to design fine editions, marketed to bibliophiles and book collectors. Rodker's socialism was always pronounced, impacting on his publishing increasingly over the decades. In the 1920s he pursued a Soviet-led publishing strategy with Preslit, the agency of which he was Director, and his own Pushkin Press. \n\nA friend of Rodker, Cunard was a prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; of Irish novelist George Moore, whose theories on printing and book production were developed during his years in Paris in the 1890s. Her own Hours Press, established with Surrealist Louis Aragon in 1927 and based in Reanville near Paris, has been well historicised in bibliographic terms. However, Cunard's aesthetic ambitions and the extent of Moore's influence on her printing practice have not been explored in any depth. Nor has the relation between her publishing practices and her politics, despite the fact that her time in Paris coincided with the beginnings of a commitment to communism that would last for the next 20 years.\n\nLargely neglected in literary history, Reavey was a Russian-born Irish poet and translator and founder of the literary agency, Bureau Litt&amp;eacute;raire Europ&amp;eacute;en. Setting up the Europa Press in Paris in 1929, he worked with S. W. Hayter and other artists associated with Atelier 17, employing, like Rodker and Cunard, some of the most promising experimental artists of the time to contribute to his publications. He returned to London with the Europa Press in the early 1930s, and with other British Surrealists such as Hayter, Julian Trevelyan and David Gascoyne, was active in introducing Surrealism to Britain. Here, continuing to work with visual artists, he too pursued a publishing agenda in line with his communism. \n\nThe histories, outputs and activities of these ventures will be explored as they intersect with their founders' political affiliations, serving to excavating an intricate network in which ideas, materials and texts circulated between France and Britain. In these ventures commercial and political motivations combined with aesthetic ambition: this study thus offers a space in which to consider the intersections between literary and artistic modernism and cultural formations of such as nationalism and communis</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art will benefit directly from the partnership and project outcomes, which aim to reach as wide a public as possible through a related display, public lecture, symposium and possible linked events. \n\nThe National Galleries of Scotland hold one of the largest and most important collections of art in the world, welcoming over a million visitors each year, the economic impact of which is estimated to be approaching &amp;pound;69m per annum. Research and care of the collections is a primary objective, which feeds directly into a responsibility to share research and knowledge, and promote access to the national collections to as wide a public as possible. Within this framework, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art Archive &amp;amp; Library aims to provide public and scholarly access to resources, both in the Reading Room at the Dean Gallery and through a programme of temporary displays and related events which draw on the Archive and Special Collections. The proposed research and its projected outcomes lends itself to these objectives and aims.\n\nIn the longer term, and with the publication of the fellow's monograph, the SNGMA will benefit from the attention that the research draws to their collections, which will also serve to increase awareness of the UK's cultural heritage on the world stage. Over subsequent years, the research may help to attract a more diverse audience to the SNGMA and increase the number of visitors to the Archive &amp;amp; Library. A further important result of this project, which brings together the SNGMA and the Centre for the History of the Book for the first time, will be the creation of new networks between Edinburgh University and local institutions. It is expected that this will lead to new collaborative project bids, for example combined doctoral awards. Such bids could directly benefit the CHB and the SNGMA in economic terms and in social and cultural terms, as the develoment of connections between the institutions may lead to joint projects that both diversify the SNGMA audience and provide local dissemination and outreach opportunities to the CHB. \n\nIn order to reach other general audiences, the fellow will offer lectures and events to other local institutions, including the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, a long established local organisation dedicated to the study of the book, and the Edinburgh International Book Festival (EIBF), a prestigious annual event held over a two-week period in August, which attracts an international audience of over 200,000 readers, publishers and book trade professionals. The festival office will be approached about the possibility of hosting a one-hour, ticketed event focused on alternative publishing, past and present. This would feature a roundtable consisting of the Fellow, and two other invited speakers, drawn from the sphere of contemporary alternative/small press publishing. This could potentially be mutually beneficial for the book festival and the participants, opening up new and international audiences to the book as a creative medium and the activities of small presses in Scotland, and would increase public engagement with the issue of media transformation by providing a historical perspective on the issue. \n\nFinally, the research will also impact on the nation's heritage by helping to consolidate Edinburgh's position as a centre for research into artists' books and alternative publishing, and, in terms of thinking through the effects of media transformation, will be of interest to policy makers and cultural custodians.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62107</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'A Book is a Performance' was an artists' books exhibition led by my research and curated in collaboration with Sophia Hao, the Centre for Artists' Books, Dundee.

The outputs that initially resulted from the partnership were research materials (interviews with Alex Finlay, Tom Clarke, Helen Douglas, Barrie Tullet), an international symposium (Modernism, Print and the Book Symposium, held at the National Galleries of Scotland, December 10th 2012) and three research publications (one in press, two under consideration at present).

Our partnership has continued through teaching: for the last two years, I have taken groups into the archives to consider the issues of collecting and preserving artists' books. Together we have also made another successful funding bid, this time bringing in another academic colleague Prof. James Loxley, and generating &amp;pound;9,931 from the Royal Society of Edinburgh to hold a series of workshops exploring Scotland's National Collections and the Digital Humanities. This has helped to establish the relationship between the Scottish National Galleries, The Centre for the History of the Book and the English Department at Edinburgh University.

Building on this collaborative partnership, the project was designed to bring together academic and curatorial expertise in a way that also engaged the public in exploring the enduring significance of these works. It led directly both to events of international significance, in the form of a high-quality public symposium and a research-led public exhibition, and to two regional events, designed to local raise awareness of and encourage engagement with SNGMA's collections. 

In December 2012, the fellow organised a public symposium under the title of 'Modernism Print and the Book' held at the SNGMA. As one of the internationally renowned National Galleries, the SNGMA is a popular attraction both for local audiences and for the many tourists who visit Edinburgh each year. Drawing on this high profile, the symposium attracted widespread attention and interest. The aim of this event was twofold: to introduce the field in general and the fellow's project in particular to the public; and to collaborate with the National Gallery in revealing the importance of their holdings. The event drew directly from research undertaken by the fellow, focusing on the relation between the French and British traditions of creative printing and book production. The programme consisted of six lectures from respected artists and academics, and one plenary lecture given by the internally renowned expert on artists' books Professor Johanna Drucker (UCLA). The event was publicised on social media, generating international interest and was booked out with 100 people registered within the first week. On the day, around 100 people took part: they were mainly Scottish-based but also came from the rest of the UK and included a number of creative artists and publishers. Attendees of the symposium benefitted though learning more about the collections and through having the opportunity to hear international experts on artists' books discussing the genre and its development and relation to modern art and literature. When asked what they took from the event, participants said: 'a wonderful symposium. It was a stimulating and productive day', 'great speakers and discussions', 'a fascinating day', 'it was really stimulating.' The symposium's impact was extended by means of the successful use of social media: the talks were live-tweeted and sparked sustained discussion from followers around the world, including a number of participants in the United States. This discussion was subsequently published online via Storify, enabling ongoing and future impact. 

The symposium generated cultural capital by building bridges between general and scholarly audiences at the SNGMA. It has highlighted the value of the work done by SNGMA in preserving and presenting artists' books and has had a lasting impact on the practices of the SNGMA as the collaboration created synergies between the history of the book and art history, allowing curatorial staff to gain insights into different approaches to the collections. This has led to the successful establishment of a collaborative doctoral award for a project based on artists' publishing, and has the potential to lead to further collaborative projects in future.

An additional collaboration was initiated between the fellow and the Centre for Artists' Books (CAB) at Duncan of Jordanstone, University of Dundee, forging connections between related collections in Scotland. This enabled the production of a research-led exhibition 'a book is a performance' that drew on various hypotheses advanced in the fellow's research concerning the interaction between books and readers, the symbolic role of the book as a cultural form. Two performances were programmed to accompany the exhibition by contemporary artists working with the book and writing. Through the performance events visitors were able to witness creative practice at work, and as they could handle the books, were able to experience the performative dimension of reading these usual and rarely accessible works, ensuring that the benefited from this collaboration was broad. Staged in April-May 2013, the exhibition was held in Dundee Contemporary Arts, a large venue with multiple exhibitions and facilitates: it is therefore difficult to pinpoint the exact number of visitors that came specifically to the exhibition. However, each performance was attended by around 30 people, and over the three weeks that it ran, the exhibition was seen by hundreds of visitors. It is hard to quantify the exhibition's impact on visitor numbers to the CAB, but publicity was circulated across the artists' book community in the UK, and the show received a positive review in the online section of 'Aesthetica: The Art and Culture Magazine' drawing attention to this under-used resource. In addition, as a direct result of reports of the exhibition, a group of artists based in France has initiated an international collaborative project on performance and publishing with the curatorial team at the CAB. 

A crucial aspect of the success of the symposium and the exhibition was the involvement of creative artists. This gave the public valuable insight into the processes of small press and alternative publishing and introduced them to the work of contemporary artists working the modernist tradition. It also offered the creative practitioners an alternative historical context for their own practice, helping them &amp;quot;to deepen [their] looking&amp;quot; as one book-artist put it, and enabling them to connect with new audiences, whose activities and interests may impact on the reception of their work in the longer term. This engagement with creative practitioners was also facilitated through the production of four research-led interviews with significant contemporary book artists, which have been recorded and deposited in the publically-accessible research collections of the SNGMA. The interviews, which focused on technique, distribution and motivation, arose directly out of the historical research of the fellow, and were designed to preserve information that is easily lost over time, ensuring that they will benefit future curators, artists and researchers.

Building on these creative practice dimensions, the fellow also held a public workshop in Kilmarnock, as part of the Impact festival run by the council there. This literary festival is in its third year and takes place in Kilmarnock every November attracting a broad local audience, who typically do not attend cultural events in the capital. The event focused on the roots of alternative publishing in the fellow's historical research and was run in collaboration with award winning artists' bookmaker Hugh Bryden. It was a hands-on workshop, which encouraged participants to make their own books during the day, inspired and influenced by the historical examples. When asked what they took from the event, participants said: 'an awareness of what you can do with the form of the book and the consequences for the reader'; 'brilliant to have some hands-on experience'; 'I will try this at home to make a book for my own poetry.'

Finally, impact was also achieved through a talk at the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society. The Society is a notable local institution whose members are largely non-academic, and it holds a series of well-attended public lectures in the city each year. Giving a talk at the Society provided a further opportunity to direct attention to the collections of the SNGMA as well as increasing local knowledge of the city's cultural resources, taking the research to a non-academic audience with a direct interest in the subject area. 

In conclusion, this project has achieved a significant reach and has successfully enhanced public appreciation of the role of small/private presses in British modernism, the collections of the Scottish National Galleries of Modern Art and the collections of the Centre for Artists' Books. It has brought the history of artists' books to public consciousness in a manner that encouraged a wide range of users to interact directly with these works and has provided a series of learning experiences for the general public, increasing their awareness of the collection materials and research activity at local institutions and helping to enhance the public profiles of these institutions nationally and internationally.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>90F768AF-7E10-4A97-BC7E-612AEB02A039</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460dfd5017288.16204106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Established accounts of the small presses of the early twentieth century position these ventures as either pragmatic and commercial or as atavistic and conservative, taking their cue from the nostalgic medievalism of the Arts and Crafts movement. My findings challenge this narrative in three ways. Firstly, the substantial new archival research enabled by this grant reveals for the first time the extent to which radical British modernist writers and artists' were engaged in experimental printing and book production as part of their broader creative practice. Secondly, I have discovered a pattern of visual and textual references made by modernist printers and book-designers that point not to the medievalism of the late nineteenth century, but to the Romantic bibliomania of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century: reading modernist book culture through this lens offers new and illuminating insights into the political and aesthetic stakes of fine press publishing in the interwar period. Finally, my research reveals that throughout the 1920s and 30s there was significant creative exchange between French Surrealists and British modernists and that in this context books, particularly livre d'artistes, were important vehicles for collaboration, experimentation and the circulation of aesthetic ideas and experiments. This latter finding has the potential to constitute the foundation of a new revisionist historiography of British Surrealism. 

These findings are presented in a series of publications (one in print, two under consideration, and a monograph in preparation), so the research is in the process of achieving its objectives of opening out the political and aesthetic dimensions of the activities and outputs of key British small presses and generating new research resources through the publication of journal articles. These publications, along with the public engagement events detailed in the outcomes, meet my objective of focusing broader attention on the importance of small press and alternative publishing, and to stimulating discussion and interest in historical and contemporary print practice among both academic and public audiences.

In addition, in conducting interviews with contemporary artists and in cataloguing material within the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art archival collections, I have developed new resources as well as practical knowledge and skills that have led me to develop interests in digital publishing, information and collection management, and the challenges of digital archiving and digital research. This has enabled me to achieve my objective of opening up new networks and ways of facilitating exchange between researchers, local and national institutions and contemporary practitioners, most notably through leading a series of knowledge exchange workshops on digitisation and research in the national collections, funded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh. It has also led to a role in the steering group of a newly formed Scottish network for the digital humanities, in collaboration with six other universities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research could be developed in numerous directions by scholars in book history and in modernist studies: in presenting a new account of the book culture of the time, and in focusing attention on the form of the book as a site of creative practice, it provides a context for interpreting and re-evaluating the publishing activities of several figures involved with modernist small presses, from George Moore to Ezra Pound; highlighting how cultural history has worked to privilege certain activities and figures and obscure others, the research also brings a number of almost forgotten 'minor' modernists into view opening up the possibility of further research that fleshes out the history of the period. 

My focus on the practices of writing and publishing has opened out new approaches to the collections of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, leading to new connections between the gallery and the university and discussion of potential for future research projects on their holdings of British Surrealism, which would be suitable as collaborative doctoral projects. The materials I generated in cataloguing the Penrose library and through interviews with artists will enable future research on historical contemporary artists. Creative practitioners, designers and curators could also use the neglected materials I have uncovered as the source of future works and exhibitions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B5EA8234-C4E0-4524-B315-4A90BD6A3596</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460df633144f8.51257179</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>I catalogued previously catalogued parts of the Roland Penrose Library held by the Scottish National galleries of Modern Art, enabling descriptive records of their holdings to made available online to researchers and the general public.
