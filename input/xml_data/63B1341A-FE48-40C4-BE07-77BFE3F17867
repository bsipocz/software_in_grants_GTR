The journeys are: \n\n(i) South Africa: beginning and ending in Cape Town, I will travel on a clock-wise journey of 15 days duration, between 15 African towns or villages that still bear Scottish place-names, e.g. Aberdeen, Balmoral, Dundee, Montrose, Sutherland. This will necessitate visiting almost every South African province. \n\n(ii) Northern Europe: Beginning and ending in Rovaniemi, I will make an anti-clockwise, 15 day journey, travelling through the Fenno-Scandinavia region that traverses Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. I will follow the best available roads to travel in an 'arctic circle', crossing the Arctic Circle on at least two occasions. \n\nThe journeys will complement each other in that they will be made in the same global time zone, 15-30 degrees east of the Greenwich meridian being common to both regions. One will take place at the southern tip of Africa, the other at the northern tip of Europe. Both journeys will be made in relatively under-populated regions that are in radically different climatic zones; they will each enable me to consider colonialism and/or occupation in the context of recent cultural changes. In South Africa, my 'Scottish' journey will be in a recently democratised country, enabling me to reflect on the healing of post-apartheid SA through the erasure of 'Bantustan' subdivisions; in Fenno-Scandinavia, home of the S&amp;aacute;mi indigenous people, I will travel in a cross-border region where recognition of S&amp;aacute;mi nationhood, established in late C20th., has received little international attention. \n\nThe resulting photographs will examine how journeys through specific socio-political regions generate sets of fabricated photographic artworks that retain their identity as discrete images, but that nevertheless represent physical and conceptual journeys. The photographs will be made through analogue methods, usi black and white, negative film. An examination of the qualities of light sensitive negatives and prints, adds to the specific focus of the project through two distinct phases of making: \n(i) travelling in order to collect 'pictures' as invisible afterimages until such time as films are developed and printed; \n(ii) processing and presenting, at which time afterimages are superseded by photographic prints with the result that a slow shift occurs from images that are connected to place towards discrete pictures that invite the eye to travel across and between picture planes.\n\nBetween will generate photographs made in different hemispheres, at the extremities of two continents that lie in the same latitude. Through these geographical and cultural (dis)connections, it will examine the gaps between photographic capture, studio production and exhibition/publication. \n\nBetween will be presented in exhibitions in the UK, South Africa and Finland; it will also form a core element of a photographic monograph to be published in 2001/12. The project will contribute to contemporary international debates concerning art and photography. Exhibitions would be directed at artists, academics and students as well as a gallery-going public. Where and when possible, I will present institutional and public lectures on my work. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the Research? \n \nRegular and occasional consumers of contemporary visual art are the most likely primary beneficiaries in that, by visiting an exhibition and/or reading a related publication, they will have an opportunity to consider the work generated by the project on various levels of engagement, from casual to informed expertise. Other primary beneficiaries will be those who have an active professional interest in contemporary visual art, including members of the professional sector such as those who work in various capacities for galleries, magazines, publishers, designers and printers. \n \nHow will they benefit? \n \nIt is a challenge for any producer of creative artefacts to determine beneficiaries of their work. However, the opportunity for benefit is likely to come through organising and/or visiting exhibitions, writing for, designing and/or reading contemporary art publications, attending public symposia/conferences and artist's talks. \n\nWhat will be done to ensure that they benefit? \n\nIt can be difficult to plan for and assess the impact of fine art research, as newly exhibited or published work rarely achieves immediate critical response beyond occasional reviews, summary listings and web-site postings. Even exhibitions in high-profile public galleries can find it difficult to attract critical attention. The favoured evaluative tool of recent years has been the head-count of gallery visitors, but this method cannot provide accurate information as to which of these recorded visitors actually benefits from exposure to the work of exhibited artists. While much new art is exhibited only once, it is only through maturing and repeated exposure in different contexts that the value of a body of new work might become accessible and therefore assessable. The reputations, of the artist, the host venue and any other contributors, such as curators, writers, designers, interpreters, tour guides, are key factors in this process of familiarisation. However, it is possible to prepare for publicity opportunities through well-designed and informative printed and web-based announcements and press releases. All of the exhibitions and publications planned for Between will be preceded by such high quality project information and publicity. The likely impact of project will also be maximized through follow-up publications, e.g. exhibition catalogues, magazine articles, website documentation, textual analysis. Exhibition-related symposia will offer audiences the dual benefits of viewing the research under exhibition conditions as well as listening to or questioning the artist. \n\nTeaching and illustrated guest lectures are important. The PI's position at Leeds, his international summer school teaching in Austria, a liaison with Pavilion and invitations to present artist talks, in the UK, in Europe and overseas, are of considerable importance as ways to broaden the audience for artwork that is primarily directed at exhibitions. In each case, the project would need to be adapted to suit a particular context of dissemination. But such talks will offer opportunities for the PI to provide critical and evaluative commentary in relation to Powerpoint illustrations, thus increasing the likelihood of Between's motivating ideas reaching audience members who will then have opportunities to ask questions. Following such talks, the artist's website will provide an important port of call for further information.\n\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32005</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H031618/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
