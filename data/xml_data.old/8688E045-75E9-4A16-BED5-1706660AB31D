Calum Iain Maclean (1915-1960) is best remembered today for his innovative field collecting carried out primarily in the Gaelic-speaking regions of Ireland and Scotland between 1942 and 1960. The collection consists mainly of tale texts, although it also includes 400 song texts, along with Maclean's field diaries and two full-length autobiographies transcribed from twentieth-century reciters of international standing. An AHRC-funded project which concluded in 2009 created a searchable database of Maclean's transcribed materials which is now the largest known digital corpus of Gaelic oral prose, amounting to c. 2.4 million words.

The proposed enhancement to the existing resource will be delivered through a combination of methods designed to engage a wider constituency. Expanding the public access section of the website to include audio and other multimedia content will ensure a more interactive experience. Effective outreach will be achieved through an online exhibition; an itinerary of Maclean's career; a series of public lectures in Edinburgh and in the Highlands; the publishing of popular articles in various mainstream outlets, as well as peer-reviewed journals; the inclusion of thirty capsule biographies of Maclean's most important informants to foster knowledge exchange and encourage interaction with donor communities; a representative selection of Maclean's collecting to be released as a 2 CD set compilation in the well-established Scottish Tradition Series using Greentrax, a leading publisher of Scottish folk music, for its marketing and distribution outlets; a one-day conference culminating in a concert in May 2013 to conclude the project.
 
In addition to leading to a greater degree of engagement with public and academic audiences, the results of the follow-on phase will provide a significantly improved level of access to a central source of tradition for Scotland's intangible cultural heritage. A unique feature of the present archival resource is that it is currently the only one of any size known to us to harness the latest technology in the digital publication of oral texts. In doing so, it enhances other recent folklore and technology initiatives that have had a significant input from the University of Edinburgh, such as the Tobar an Dualchais/Kist o Riches and the Carmichael Watson Projects. The expertise and knowledge gained from the two successful projects places Celtic and Scottish Studies and Information Services with their history of collaboration at the University at a distinct advantage in managing these resources with a view to their future development and enhancement.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The current proposal aims to maximise the impact of the previously AHRC-funded Calum Maclean Project by engaging a wide range of individuals and audiences, both Gaelic-speaking and non-Gaelic-speaking, within and outwith Scotland. Internationally, significant impetus has been given to the recognition and promotion of traditional arts through the setting up of UNESCO's 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), (see www.unesco.org/culture/ich/ and www.unesco.org.uk/documenting_intangible_cultural_heritage_%28ich%29_in_scotland). Widespread benefits will result from the project's promotion of the importance of indigenous cultures to long-term development within the United Kingdom. Such impacts will initially be perceived as cultural, but will also be realised economically by providing a flexible, documented base of information for industries such as cultural tourism. 

The materials available on the website will contribute significantly to the fund of basic information necessary for the formulation of future policy decisions, primarily in Scotland, affecting culture, education, and language policy. The impact on public services is particularly worthy of note. Improved access to information regarding primary, community-based materials will serve as direct and effective support for arts and educational policies in Scotland. Within the new national arts agency, Creative Scotland, what have come to be termed 'the traditional arts' are seen to have a crucial role (Creative Scotland, Investing in Scotland's Creative Future, Corporate Plan, 2011-14 www.creativescotland.com/about/our-plans#Plan). A key development for the maintenance and growth of Scotland's indigenous arts has been the establishing of a new organisation, core-funded by Creative Scotland, called Traditional Arts and Culture Scotland (TRACS) (Scottish Government, Traditional Arts Working Group Report, 2010; www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/01/28100441/0). Users will include educational institutions (e.g. The Curriculum for Excellence Gaelic Resource Bank); the arts/culture sector (e.g. Proiseact nan Ealan/National Gaelic Arts Agency's Sgeulachdan/Folktales Project); the Scottish Storytelling Centre; the media (Gaelic radio and TV, and English/Scots language cultural programming on the BBC); a range of community groups and historical societies; and minority or multicultural organisations throughout Scotland. Information made available through the project website will provide organisations with the means of identifying community-based, primary vernacular materials for their future programmes, and ways in which they may be used. Further important groups to benefit are those working in the development sector and connected with Gaelic language maintenance. They include: Bord na G&amp;agrave;idhlig; Comunn na G&amp;agrave;idhlig; National Gaelic Arts Agency; Gaelic Media Service; and Storlann N&amp;agrave;iseanta na G&amp;agrave;idhlig. 

The project is well placed to make a lasting contribution to the understanding by both popular and academic audiences of the communal role that oral tradition continues to fill in the Gaelic-speaking communities throughout the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and serves as an ideal means for demonstrating the importance of indigenous cultures to long-term social development. For Gaels the materials collected by Maclean are closely associated with concepts and practices of social solidarity; at the same time, they express principles of inclusivity around identity and culture that easily extend to the rest of Scotland as well as to all age groups and both genders. In fact, they are an ideal and time-tested means of furthering these concepts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>88779</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Three lectures delivered to audiences in donor communities</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>8679DEDA-BE53-4E21-8A12-2438E486A462</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The object of the lecture series was to describe and discuss Maclean's work in the communities, or associated communities, where it was carried out.
