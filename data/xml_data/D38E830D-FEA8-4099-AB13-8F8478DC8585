This research aims to develop a new series of solid catalysts that we intend to use to produce cyclic compounds using a reaction called cycloaddition. Our catalysts are comprised of a grid-like assembly of metal atoms and organic linkers, and these materials are called metal-organic frameworks (abbreviated to MOFs). MOFs are relatively new materials and use of them for catalysing reactions is very rare. They have, however, great promise as they contain pores in which the reactions occur, and the size and shapes of these pores can be controlled by altering the organic linkers.Many natural and synthetic compounds are chiral, which means they can exist in left-handed and right-handed forms that are mirror images of each other. Chirality is important in the production of drugs as usually only one of the two possible left- or right-handed drug molecules is biologically active. We intend to see if by using chiral MOF catalysts we can produce reaction products that are themselves chiral i.e. only left or right-handed.To undertake these studies we intend to attack the problem from two points of view: One of these uses synthetic chemistry and the production of MOF catalysts in the laboratory; the other is based on computer simulations, predicting how these catalysts could work at a molecular level. By combining these two approaches we hope to 'fuse' these two processes together and produce more efficient MOF catalysts that produce cycloaddition products in a pure state and as one chirality, either 'left' or 'right'. We will also measure the diffusion and adsorption properties of the catalysts so we find out how the reagents move into the pores and how the molecules interact with the catalyst.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>138337</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Metal-organic frameworks (abbreviated to MOFs) are a relatively new class of material, and are comprised of a grid-like assembly of metal atoms and organic linkers. MOFs have shown great promise as solid state catalysts as they contain pores in which reactions can occur, and the size and shapes of these pores can be controlled by altering the organic linkers thus tailoring the reaction conditions in the pores. In this project we have developed new functionalised linkers, prepared and characterised new MOFs based on these, and studied computationally the adsorption properties of the new materials for chiral and other separations. In addition, we have shown that MOFs can act as catalysts, increasing the rates of cycloaddition reactions to produce cyclic organic compounds. 

In the part of the project carried out at Bath, MOF syntheses were investigated with a wide range of metals and ligands, including chiral linkers to generate chiral pores, and linkers containing reactive functional groups projecting into the pores. 16 new MOF compounds have been crystallographically characterised, and their porosities and catalytic activities assessed. From the University of Bath team three papers have been published to date, and another four are in preparation. 

In the part of the project carried out at the University of Edinburgh, a wide variety of MOFs were assessed for the separation of liquid phase mixtures such as the separation of xylene mixtures. We furthermore looked in detail at the separation of chiral diol mixtures identifying the factors that contributes to high ee-values. Additionally, we assessed the gas storage and separation properties of MOFs synthesized at Bath. From the University of Edinburgh team one paper has been published to date, and another three are in preparation. 

In the part undertaken at UEA we have generated a series of unique functionalized linkers based on the pyridine heterocycle. The synthesis of the core precursor linker was achieved using [2+2+2] cycloaddition chemistry and their subsequent elaboration undertaken using transition metal catalysed modifications. The synthesis of optically active vaulted multicyclic aryl ring systems has been attempted and their incorporation into MOFs probed. It is envisaged that in the near future the UEA team will submit two - three publications, however due to the late start of this aspect of the project these are not yet complete. 

As a whole, this project has brought together chemists and chemical engineers, and successfully integrated asymmetric organic synthesis, inorganic materials chemistry and computational modelling. Three PhD students will shortly graduate, each with a unique insight at the strategically important chemistry-chemical engineering interface, and direct experience of the three strands that make up this synergic project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B552C7F5-031D-4ED0-880B-A6D157127FDF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6527148258.43195277992ebc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>70A4BA7F-071B-43B5-A533-3533D7BA688E</gtr:id><gtr:title>calixarene based metal-organic frameworks: towards hierarchically porous materials</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>chemical communications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/583d14a8ea4f893cc9f7844bea855ade"><gtr:id>583d14a8ea4f893cc9f7844bea855ade</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sean Bew (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_747713029913684198</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C3B2F794-A1DE-4AD9-883A-E48D2ABB1892</gtr:id><gtr:title>Calix[4]arene-based metal-organic frameworks: towards hierarchically porous materials.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b50840408e61dad03fce94827b8cd65f"><gtr:id>b50840408e61dad03fce94827b8cd65f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bew SP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>543eda35adf870.75506229</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F008325/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>41B6965D-D659-4099-9434-7C61B7E5BEF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asymmetric Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
