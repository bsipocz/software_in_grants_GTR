Although it dates back many centuries, it has recently been associated with up to 44% of convictions for murder (where two or more individuals have been convicted). Although recent changes to the Joint Enterprise doctrine may narrow its scope, it still relies on associations being made between individuals and their involvement in an act of violence. In a recent study of individual's convicted of murder under this doctrine, there were indications that disparities exist between young people's conceptions of friendship and collective violence and the way in which such concepts were interpreted by criminal justice practitioners, as well as a general lack of awareness about Joint Enterprise. These findings have implications for the perceived legitimacy of Joint Enterprise and its potential to deter collective violence (a proposed benefit of it). The proposed study would explore these themes in detail. Specifically, it would consider: how young people conceptualise 'friendship' and 'collective violence'; how knowledge and/or experience of Joint Enterprise shapes young people's interpretations of collective violence and friendship; and how conceptions of violence and friendship applied by practitioners in cases of Joint Enterprise.

In total, 75 young people, aged 16-25 years old, would be interviewed and a subsample of 20 young people would participate in photovoice - an innovative methodology allowing participants to represent their 'everyday realities' through photographs. A 'community sample' would involve 25 young people studying at college and 25 young people identified as having been involved in serious collective violence, which would would allow comparisons to be made between conceptions of friendship and collective violence among young people with more or less experience of violent behaviour. Interviews would involve a life history element, focusing on previous experiences and current understandings of friendship, collective violence, and the criminal law as it relates to such violence. 

Interviews would also be undertaken with around 25 crininal justice practitioners involved in Joint Enterprise cases, specifically police officers and prosecution and defence lawyers. This part of the research would provide an account of the way in which friendship and collective violence was interpreted by those who investigate and apply the law related to Joint Enterprise and offer a counter narrative to that of the young people.

The research would aim to contribute to the sparse, but slowly developing, research on Joint Enterprise at a particularly significant time in its history. It would allow consideration of the impact that recent changes to this doctrine have had on practice. In this sense, the research would aim to inform policy and practice about the effect of collective punishment on those directly affected by it, as well as the broader population who may get caught up in its far-reaching net.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As the research will take place during a time when the application of the law of Joint Enterprise is changing and concerns about young people, friendship and violence are ever present (particularly in relation to 'gang culture'), the study would have implications for a wide range of academics, practitioners, policy makers and lay people. Potential beneficiaries include: policy makers responsible for young people and the Criminal Justice System, including sentencing; third sector organisations involved with young people; criminal justice practitioners, including the police, lawyers and those working in the prison system; pressure groups interested in the legal experiences of young people, such as JENGbA (Joint Enterprise Guilty by Association) and young people themselves, who through the impact activities we hope will gain insight into the way in which the law as it relates to collective violence is applied.
Policy makers would be informed by the examination of legal consciousness among young people, specifically how the law relates to their everyday experiences of collective violence and friendship and the extent to which punitive and collective punishments are likely to deter young people from being involved in serious collective violence. In light of the House of Commons Justice Committee investigation into Joint Enterprise and the recent Supreme Court judgement on Joint Enterprise, this research would speak to current political and judicial interests.
The research would also be relevant to the work of third sector organisations who work with young people in the areas of violence and the law. Such organisations would be engaged with throughout the process and particularly at the dissemination stage. For example, conversations have already been undertaken with JENGbA - a group campaigning against Joint Enterprise who are in direct contact with 640 people convicted under Joint Enterprise. Engaging with such organisations from an objective reference point allows for appropriate knowledge transfer and access to those most affected by such laws (e.g., through the quarterly newsletter produced by JENGbA sent to those who engage with the organisation).
The research findings would also be of benefit to practitioners, who would be interested in the extent to which young people understand the law as it applies to them. Both police officers and lawyers may make assumptions about young people's levels of understanding and the relevance of the law to their everyday lives. The proposed study would provide a systematic framework within which practitioners could structure their interpretations of their interactions with young people. This would be advanced through the photovoice methods used in the study. It is also intended that the research would further encourage and inspire lawyers and police officers to engage in dissemination and impact activities with young people to better inform young people about the doctrine of Joint Enterprise as it may apply to their everyday lives.
The research would therefore also impact young people, who could benefit from conversations related to the law as it applies to collective violence, as well as broader discussions about the relevance of friendships to their lives both in the community and for those in prison, convicted of collective violence. By making our findings available to young people, encouraging them to 'steer' the research and asking them to engage in the dissemination process we hope to validate their experiences and give a voice to this often marginalised group.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>330466</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P001378/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
