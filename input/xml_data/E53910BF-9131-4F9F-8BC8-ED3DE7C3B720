Social surveys are a key tool used by the media, policy makers, and academics to understand more about public attitudes and behaviour. However, the value of surveys is put at risk by the fact that a large and growing number of those selected to take part in surveys do not respond. As non-respondents may be very different from respondents, nonresponse can introduce significant bias into the conclusions drawn from survey data. There is a pressing need therefore to understand more about the extent and sources of nonresponse bias. This requires having information about both respondents and non-respondents. In the absence of interview data being available for non-respondents, this information must be obtained from other, external, sources. 
 
The growth in &amp;quot;Big Data&amp;quot; i.e. routinely generated data arising from commercial transactions, online communication or public administration provides exciting new opportunities to supplement survey data with data from other sources. As opportunities for data linkage increase, there is a need for a detailed investigation into how such data can be used to understand and hopefully correct for nonresponse bias in general social surveys. This project will conduct such an investigation by adding pre-existing data from multiple sources to UK data from the European Social Survey (ESS), a methodologically rigorous survey of public attitudes. 
 
The project, drawing on the expertise of an inter-disciplinary team of survey researchers, statisticians and geographic information (GI) specialists, has three strands: First, the project will explore the opportunities that exist for matching data from three different sources to survey data. These include: small-area administrative data; commercial marketing data and geocoded information from the Ordnance Survey. Each data source will be evaluated in terms of: what information it can provide which may be matched to the survey records of respondents and non-respondents; the accuracy and completeness of this information; and the challenges that matching data presents in terms of the increased risk of individuals or households being identified from the combination of data held about them. 
 
Second, we will see how the matched data can provide information about potential biases that may be present in the survey data as a result of nonresponse. This will involve identifying any external variables associated both with the likelihood of nonresponse and the attitudes and behaviour the survey intendeds to measure. The project will consider how sources of nonresponse bias may vary geographically across the UK. 
 
Finally, we will assess whether using these external variables to create nonresponse weights to adjust for the possible over or under representation of certain types of respondent in the dataset has a significant effect on survey estimates and reduces bias in the data. 
 
This project has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding not only of survey nonresponse bias but also the statistical tools available to remedy this bias, to improve survey data collection and generate more robust data to better understand public attitudes and behaviour. Lessons learnt will enhance general social surveys in the UK and internationally. This will have considerable benefits for the wide range of stakeholders involved in the funding, collection, and analysis of survey data and those who rely on the insights it provides. This includes academics, government agencies and other publically funded bodies, third sector organisations, policy makers and, ultimately, the general public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this project extends well beyond the academic community. By providing new insights into how auxiliary data may enhance the value of survey data - specifically how it may be used to understand and correct for potential biases arising from nonresponse - this project has the potential to benefit all those involved in the funding, collection and analysis of survey data and/or auxiliary data and who are concerned about the possible effects of nonresponse bias. This includes commercial survey agencies, government agencies and other publically funded bodies, and third sector organisations.

This impact will be realised in three main ways: 
i) By leading to improvements in survey practice - including more efficient and cost-effective data collection - across the international survey community; 
ii) By providing data users - through these improvements in survey practice - with more high quality survey data to inform their understanding of public attitudes and behaviour;
iii) By establishing mutually beneficial relationships and promoting opportunities for collaboration between auxiliary data providers and survey practitioners. 

The most immediate impacts will be on organisations involved in survey data collection - including commercial social and market research agencies - who will benefit from the methodological insights this project will provide into how auxiliary data may be used i) to improve the efficiency of survey data collection through more effective targeting of fieldwork resources ii) to enhance the quality of survey data by reducing nonresponse bias. The use of geographical information techniques to map spatial variation in nonresponse will allow more nuanced strategies for preventing and reducing bias. We will work closely with Ipsos MORI throughout the project and will also seek to share learning within other survey agencies in the UK, including NatCen Social Research, TNS BMRB, GfK NOP and Gallup, and in ESS-participating countries across Europe. 

Longer term, the potential improvements to survey practice resulting from this project will have an impact on the wide range of non-academic stakeholders who use survey data to understand society and to inform policy decisions as well as those who experience the effect of these decisions. This includes the media, politicians, policy makers in local and central government, third sector organisations and, ultimately, the general public. 

Also in the longer term, this project will have an impact on those who fund survey research. Linking auxiliary data to survey data has the potential to make survey data more cost-effective by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of data collection and enhancing the quality of the inferences that can be drawn from the resulting data. A range of organisations frequently commission surveys including charities, local and central government and other publicly funded bodies such as the police. Given the large amount of publically funded social research this ultimately benefits the tax payer. 

The project has the potential to benefit organisations involved in the production of auxiliary data by promoting the value of these data in survey research and forging new opportunities for collaboration between auxiliary data producers and the international survey community. This will allow data producers - especially those whose work is publically funded - to demonstrate that these data provide good value for money. Ultimately this will benefit data users by helping to secure the continued generation of such data. During the project we will engage directly with commercial organisations such as Experian and CallCredit as well as government departments and other publically funded bodies such as the Office for National Statistics.

This included small area administrative data from a variety of sources, data from commercial vendors and local geographic or &amp;quot;Points of Interest&amp;quot; data. This was a complex and labour intensive process which facilitated the exploration of several datasets - including data from commercial vendors and the Ordnance Survey Points of Interest dataset - not widely used by survey methodologists in the UK. Valuable lessons were learned about the quality and accessibility of the different data sources including: the importance of appending data at the time the sample is drawn rather than subsequently (so data covers the appropriate time periods and relevant assurances can be given to survey participants), the challenge of appending data for the whole of the UK given differences in data collection and availability across the devolved administrations, and concerns about the completeness, accuracy and transparency of commercial data. These findings have been carefully documented in a project technical report - which will be made available via the project website - to provide insights for other researchers interested in exploiting auxiliary data. 

The starting hypothesis for this project was that auxiliary data would be useful in predicting and understanding survey response behaviour. In fact, the contribution of this project - which provides one of the most thorough tests of the auxiliary data approach to date - is therefore likely to be to urge caution over the commonly advocated approach of using external sources of auxiliary data to address the problem of survey nonresponse. Using the auxiliary data linked in this project it has proved difficult to identify variables which are significantly associated with both response propensity and substantive survey variables. This remains the case even after exploring auxiliary data from a range of sources, at different levels of aggregation, covering the major theories of survey response and using a variety of statistical techniques. The main predictors of response propensity are simple interviewer observations regarding the type of dwelling unit, the physical condition of the property and whether there are barriers to entry. Rather than pursuing external sources of auxiliary data it may prove more fruitful to pursue further research into improving the potential of interviewer observations should perhaps be pursued. Papers documenting the findings from nonresponse analysis are being prepared. 

Although the project had limited success in predicting survey nonresponse when using global models applied to the full sample, some interesting findings emerged when applying spatial modelling techniques such as geographically weighted regression (GWR) to explore whether and how the drivers of nonresponse may vary spatially. For example, across the UK as a whole there is little evidence that survey response propensity varies with population density. However, when breaking the results down by geography we discovered that in some areas (mainly in the North West of England and Scotland) population density was negatively correlated with response propensity whereas in others (predominantly in the South West of England) population density was positively correlated with response propensity. Moving away from a &amp;quot;one size fits all&amp;quot; approach to modelling survey nonresponse and allowing models to vary spatially or across different population sub-groups may prove more instructive. 
This project has fostered new research collaborations between the social scientists and survey methodologists leading the project and researchers working in other disciplines. These collaborations with data visualisation specialists working in the giCentre at City University London and Prof. Chris Brunson, an expert in geocomputation, have had a number of positive results. The first has been to encourage survey researchers to think spatially and consider social survey data in their geographical context, thereby gaining a better understanding of the phenomena being studied. Brunsdon has trained members of the research team in geographically weighted regression, a statistical technique that can be used to explore a wide range of substantive and methodological research questions. A paper applying GWR to analyse the drivers of survey nonresponse is in preparation for the journal Environment and Planning B. The second result has been to start to develop new data visualisation tools to assist researchers in the statistical analysis of complex datasets. Using the dataset generated by the project and working alongside social researchers to understand their needs and workflow, researchers from the gicentre have been exploring how data visualisation can help researchers to select variables for analysis and evaluate and keep track of different models developed using both theory driven and data-driven machine learning techniques. A paper is currently under review with the journal Neurocomputing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The failure to identify suitable auxiliary variables to predict nonresponse bias means that some of the proposed benefits from this project - e.g. an improved weighting strategy for the European Social Survey or a response predictor tool for use on UK surveys - will not be realised. 

However, this null finding has important implications for the main non-academic audience for the project - survey practitioners. It suggests that, when deciding how to address the ongoing problem of survey nonresponse with limited resources, survey agencies may be better off not investing time or money in external sources of auxiliary data but instead pursuing other strategies such as investing in interviewer training or improved survey paradata which could then be used in responsive design or for post-hoc adjustments. 

The findings also serve to advance academic debates among survey methodologists about the usefulness of auxiliary data for addressing nonresponse bias. Many methodologists have argued for the importance of obtaining auxiliary data for nonresponse analysis. This comprehensive study suggests that even when such data are available they may not be fit for purpose. Other strategies for studying nonresponse bias - such as surveys of nonrespondents or the use of benchmark surveys such as the Labour Force Survey - should be pursued instead. 

Even though the main finding from this project appears to be that the types of auxiliary data investigated here are likely to be of limited use in tackling survey nonresponse, these auxiliary data may still be useful in other ways. Within academia, substantive researchers may be interested in using auxiliary data for studying contextual effects on behaviour whilst survey practitioners can make use of auxiliary data to identify specific target groups for oversampling). The project's data scoping exercise - identifying a wide range of different sources of auxiliary data and the issues associated with them - will be useful to them in pursuing their own uses of auxiliary data. 

The introduction of new analytical techniques such as geographically weighted regression to the survey community also opens up new lines of research. The technique has the potential to be used to analyse spatial variation in substantive survey variables and other aspects of respondent or interviewer behaviour.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B5AD23A0-DDDE-4237-8632-E4873B3FE72B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d08d7bc76f38.56216833</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://blogs.city.ac.uk/addresponse/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The dataset combines pre-existing data from the European Social Survey Round 6 (UK) with auxiliary data collated from a range of sources.
