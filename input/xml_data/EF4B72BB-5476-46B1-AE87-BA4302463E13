The starting point for the project is the fieldwork undertaken by Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson in Bali in 1936/39, perhaps the first major utilisation of film and photography within anthropological practice (totalling some 25,000 photographs and 20,000ft of film), and certainly one of the most influential. In part this fieldwork was funded by the Committee for Research in Dementia Praecox, as schizophrenia was then known, which was concerned with the high levels of diagnosis in America (in the mid-1930s, 25% of hospital beds were occupied by patients so diagnosed) and sought to initiate new forms of child-rearing in order to reduce the number of people developing the condition. As Balinese culture was considered to be 'schizoid', in Bateson's words, it was thought a study of how the Balinese coped with this 'condition' would help develop child-rearing methods that could be adopted in America, reducing the incidents of schizophrenia. One might suggest that this was more an attempt to bolster American self-identity than to understand the identity of another culture.\n This project takes the historical fieldwork of Mead and Bateson as a starting point from which to consider a number of broader questions, perhaps most importantly, how do different cultures interact, or attempt to understand one another? The often troubled relationship between America's sense of itself, and its sense of others, is obviously of great contemporary relevance, in relation to the 'War of Terror'; this is particularly the case with regards to Bali / an increasingly 'Westernized' but predominantly Hindu state within the largest Muslim country in the world, and victim of a number of terrorist bombings in recent years. Bali finds itself at the intersection between sometimes violently divergent cultures and beliefs, and in attempting to engage with this country, I hope that this project will suggest some new means of cultural interaction based upon mutual respect rather than forceful imposition.\n The work of Mead and Bateson shows us some possibilities of cultural understanding, but makes us aware of the difficulties also, difficulties that will be made explicit within the project itself. The outcome will be a series of related artworks / perhaps consisting of an artist's film, photographs, writings, and a re-display of part of the collection at the Pitt Rivers Musuem / and a publication that will be founded upon actual anthropological research, albeit a research that will be led by my own artistic practice rather than by the more usual demands of the discipline. Of course, certain methods will be adopted from anthropological research / such as fieldwork, and interviews / not only to revisit (to some extent) Mead's and Bateson's original research, but also to examine the influence that it has had subsequently in a number of fields, in particular philosophy; however, these methods will be examined self-critically, with careful consideration to what it is that they conceal, as much as reveal. This is an approach that I have developed successfully in recent years, using comparable episodes in art history, and philosophy, as a starting point to create works which combine intellectual / even scholarly / enquiry within a fictional, and often poetic, framework and sensibility. This allows me to create a space within another discipline in which I can situate and then develop my own practice, to the mutual benefit of both. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>263385</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Solo exhibition of works, including those exhibited as part of 'Given' at the National Maritime Museum, and 'Tokinana sola Bosubasoba and Tristan und Iseult', made in Papua New Guinea at the same time as the other works in 'Given'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>72D70DD6-8E49-4E51-8B29-035451F69F4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition remains the largest exhibition of mine - in terms of the number of works included - and included works such as 'Incomplete Open Cubes (Burnt)' (2010), which was subsequently remade for my solo show at CCA, Glasgow, in 2011.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-4008970683.4489207a70f6164</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Amongst Others</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.plymouthartscentre.org/gallery/2010/jeremy-millar-amongst-others.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A video of a performance choreographed and performed by Ni Mad&amp;eacute; Pujawati and Ash Muhkerjee, and based upon Antonin Artaud's viewing of Balinese dance at the Paris Colonial Exhibition in 1931.</gtr:description><gtr:id>83C772FF-A4DB-4B95-978B-A74CCE78E8D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film was shown during lectures by Mark Hobart and Ni Mad&amp;eacute; Pujawati in Australia and Bali to a very favorable critical reception.

A film shot in the extraordinary Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, during the 'decant' of a number of display cases in advance of building work in the museum's entrance; here, a number of curators remove items from display, check their condition, and pack them safely for storage.

'Human Form in Art' is the descriptive title of the two particular display cases being decanted, which contain object representations of the human form. Given the comparative nature of many of the displays in the Pitt Rivers Museum, some of the objects are more representational, some more abstract, than others; indeed, the move to abstraction was something that the Museum's displays have, historically, paid particular attention to. Similarly, the actual human forms of the curators working on these displays are subject to increasing abstraction - bisected by display cases, or becoming rather immaterial reflections - before disappearing completely, their protective coats and gloves all that remain.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3C30CB48-4F28-48CF-93A4-1065C8D118EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work was exhibited at Turner Contemporary Project Space in 2008, and formed the basis of a conversation with Dr Dan Hicks (University of Oxford), at Modern Art Oxford in 2013.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460b6835c85b4.93176067</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Human Form in Art</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.jeremymillar.org/works-detail.php?wid=192</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A soundtrack, composed by Nye Parry, for the artist's film, 'Artaud'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E657DE6F-FA33-49B5-9C3A-DEFAE5BFFC9B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film was shown during lectures by Mark Hobart and Ni Mad&amp;eacute; Pujawati in Australia and Bali to a very favorable critical reception.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-5375087042.688474a714d220</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Score created as the soundtrack to 'Artaud' film</gtr:title><gtr:type>Composition/Score</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOGu8z5uGKQ</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A number of artworks commissioned by the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, for the exhibition in 2009-2010.

Works made which build upon the research practices developed during this project have been made in collaboration with the Warburg Institute, London, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and have been exhibited at Yaffo23, Jerusalem.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E4209846-CA35-44CA-BB9F-34128657F0D6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cbb1c387b32.94817100</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>An important discovery of this research - and one which has been increasingly important given the collaborative nature of many artistic projects - in the recognition that my own artistic practice be considered legitimate academic research in its own right, and one that could make valuable contributions to anthropology and other academic disciplines. The 'freedom' I have as an artist has been noted by numerous anthropologists and archaeologists, all of whom have commented that many of the projects I have developed would have been impossible for them to develop within their own disciplines yet were valuable contributions to those disciplines. It seems that the 'better' my artwork has become as artwork, then the greater its contribution to other disciplines, and its engagement with those working within them.

I have discovered that the best approach for collaborative working with those working in other fields is not to accept a lesser role as, perhaps, a more junior researcher within their field, but rather as an equal partner working within my own. This is not necessarily how many collaborative projects seem to be structured, although in my experience it is how those involved in them prefer to work, and find the most rewarding and productive.

This project has also confirmed that a practice such as my own is dependent upon forms of research which possess a rigour which is not always recognized, or understood, by certain assessment methods; the same is true of that which it produces, which are not so easily quantified or instrumentalised. This is very apparent on the ResearchFish website, for example.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings will be of interest and use to those working within various sectors of the arts and humanities who are interested in how artistic practice might be used as a form of legitimate academic research, and how it might be used to activate or consider historical events. It might also be of interest to those using counterfactual histories to explore various developments, and of 'what might have been'. 

I hope that the artworks produced will also have a value and 'use' of themselves, albeit one which cannot be so easily quantified or instrumentalised.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E036EDD7-14CF-4525-92E5-59C6C80F196A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ce80580e063.54806214</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B2603EBE-CEDF-44CF-A65E-5F4794A74C83</gtr:id><gtr:title>M/W</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea6fbf6b9817e82e63ada0a0eb4cb405"><gtr:id>ea6fbf6b9817e82e63ada0a0eb4cb405</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Polit, P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5460a6a8a174c8.46053637</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DB00B17E-B7D1-4606-8082-C89436E40F24</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Given'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7ce6189dbf58ef08c75b91df3dfbd20b"><gtr:id>7ce6189dbf58ef08c75b91df3dfbd20b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LeFeuvre L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_6082386358640ff40c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E005608/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
