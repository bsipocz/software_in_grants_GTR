The pre-eminent class of intermolecular interaction is the hydrogen bond. More recently established are halogen bonds, highly important interactions which parallel hydrogen bonds. 

The atoms within molecules are usually held together by strong chemical bonds (150-1000 kJ/mol), but their molecular structures are often strongly influenced by forces that are about 10 times weaker, of which the most famous is the hydrogen bond. It is the hydrogen bond that provides the means for DNA to encode genetic information and for proteins to acquire their specificity. These weaker forces also underlie interactions between molecules, and hence determine how small molecules assemble into larger structures. Self-assembly is the process of forming the larger structures: it pervades research and technology in areas ranging from materials chemistry to catalysis to structural biology. For instance, it is the interaction of a drug with a protein that determines its activity, or the interaction of a catalyst with a substrate that determines its specificity.

When strong chemical bonds are formed, for instance between nitrogen and hydrogen atoms, the electrons are distributed unevenly; the nitrogen acquires a slight negative charge and the hydrogen acquires a slight positive charge. A hydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom with a slight positive charge interacts with another atom with a slight negative charge: e.g. N-H...OC, where O has a partial negative charge. In this project we will also focus on the halogen bond, in which the role of the hydrogen is replaced by a halogen (iodine, bromine or chlorine) with the partial positive charge. This situation arises when these halogens are attached to other groups that pull the electrons away, for instance fluorine-containing groups. 

In 2004, Hunter presented a quantitative approach to understanding the impact of molecular interactions that has unified all classes of intermolecular interaction in all solvents. The basic principles have now been experimentally validated for simple systems that form hydrogen bonds, but the challenge is to implement this approach in systems that are more complicated and feature different types of intermolecular interaction. The research programme will examine hydrogen bonds to transition metal complexes and halogen bonds in general. The resulting quantitative measurements will be placed on a common scale with existing knowledge of organic hydrogen bonds.

The dominant techniques for quantitative probing of molecular interactions in solution will be nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (especially appropriate to the transition metal compounds) and automated ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy (especially for the organic molecules). The interaction energies will often be determined at many temperatures, giving a full range of energetic information. The geometry of the interactions will be studied by X-ray crystallography, supported by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. The experimental studies will be underpinned by computational methods based on quantum mechanics that can predict the site of interaction and its strength. 

The Brammer-Hunter-Perutz team bring great experience of studying intermolecular interactions and an established record of collaboration. The project is divided into three sections: (A) studies of transition metal compounds, (B) studies of interactions of organic molecules, (C) development of quantitative scales for hydrogen-bond and halogen-bond donor and acceptor strengths. Brammer provides the lead in crystallography, Perutz in NMR spectroscopy especially of transition metal complexes, and Hunter in automated UV/visible spectroscopy of organic molecules. Hunter also is the leader in data analysis methods and in computational methods.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although this project is fundamental research, it has the potential to impact on many current research problems across the science and technology area. The aim is to establish a general model for the prediction of the properties of non-covalent interactions for an unprecedented range of molecular species, both organic and inorganic. The physical properties as well as most of the functional properties of molecular systems in chemistry, biology and materials science are all governed by non-covalent interactions. Although computational methods can now begin to make useful predictions about structure, especially for biopolymers that have evolved to adopt a single well-defined conformation, our ability to make predictions about thermodynamic properties lags far behind. The proposed development of a quantitative relationship between chemical structure and the thermodynamics of non-covalent interactions will unlock the doorway to a new era in rational molecular design in many areas where trial and error or random screening currently represent the state of the art, e.g. drug design, catalysis, sensors and smart materials. There are many apparently simple but important problems that one can imagine tackling from first principles based on chemical structure, e.g. mixing and solubility, but currently more empirical approaches are the state of the art. If molecular engineering is to become a reality in the 21st century, the development of any genuine form of synthetic non-biological nanotechnology will require an intimate appreciation of the specifications of the basic building materials, i.e. we must learn the relationship between chemical structure, non-covalent interactions and properties. The insights arising from this research programme will therefore be directly applicable in fields like organocatalysis, biocatalysis, transition metal catalysis, process chemistry, drug design, sensor design, molecular machines, smart polymers and nanotechnology to name a few areas where there is much current activity.

The project will produce two scientists with training and expertise that spans the traditional disciplines of organic, inorganic, physical and theoretical chemistry, with experience of working in a collaborative team. The interdisciplinary nature of the work will equip the appointees for work at the interfaces with other disciplines, which is where they are likely to have to most impact in their future research careers. A knowledge of non-covalent chemistry underpins almost all of the chemical industries: pharmaceutical, agrochemicals, dyes, liquid crystals and polymers, including basic R&amp;amp;D, chemical engineering, manufacturing and process chemistry. The applicants collaborate with a range of pharmaceutical, agrochemical and computational drug discovery companies, so there is plenty of potential for knowledge transfer and industrial input to the project through these interactions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>363551</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research is fundamental in nature and its aim has been to develop and improve our understanding of key intermolecular interactions, specifically hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds, across all of chemistry and, in particular, to develop and enhance predictive capabilities for applications involving use of such interactions. This has been done by providing a quantitative foundation for evaluating and applying such intermolecular interactions that can in future will be able to be deployed on many current research problems across the science and technology area. The physical properties as well as most of the functional properties of molecular systems in chemistry, biology and materials science are all governed by non-covalent interactions. Thus, the research from this award underpins many areas of science that are related to self-assembly or directed assembly of molecules or molecular building blocks. The insights arising from this award are applicable in fields like organocatalysis, biocatalysis, transition metal catalysis, process chemistry, drug design, sensor design, molecular machines, smart polymers and nanotechnology to name a few areas where there is much current activity. The economic and societal impact will derive from research progress in these areas and will be felt in the long term rather than the short term (i.e. period of the award).

The project has also produced three young scientists with training and expertise that spans the traditional disciplines of organic, inorganic, physical and theoretical chemistry, with experience of working in a collaborative team. Two were based in York (award EP/J012955/1) and one in Sheffield (award EP/J012998/1). Their skills and experience will make them attractive potential employees across many areas of the chemical industries: pharmaceutical, agrochemicals, dyes, liquid crystals and polymers, including basic R&amp;amp;D, chemical engineering, manufacturing and process chemistry. Indeed one of the three has moved on to work for a company in the area of catalysis and the other two have remained employed in academia.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EA58FCD8-F241-42B4-89A3-F5849D6B2F78</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e159ef8593a2.55340129</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The scientific objectives of the award fell into three categories (A-C), which are discussed in more detail below. The objectives expected within the timeframe of the award have been met or even surpassed for objectives A and B. The new results also clearly indicate that much more of great research interest and value to a broad research community could be achieved in these areas. Objective C was always a much longer term aim and the expectation was that progress could be made in this area in the timeframe of the award and that a foundation could be laid for a future unified scale for evaluating and application of intermolecular interactions across a broad area of science. Such progress has been made, allowing a clearer picture of how to move forward with this long-term objective.

A. Quantifying transition metal hydrogen-bond and halogen-bond acceptors. 
Substantial progress has been made in quantifying the strength of both hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds involving halide and pseudo-halide ligands bound to transition metals. These are important in expanding the knowledge and utility of these important intermolecular interactions in inorganic chemistry, where applications include supramolecular assembly, catalysis, and molecular sensing. During the period of the award two full papers have been published in the top chemistry journal Journal of the American Chemical Society, and are likely to be of high impact. One paper reports for the first time that hydride ligands can function as halogen bond acceptors. The corresponding report, some 20 years ago, that hydride ligands can function as hydrogen bond acceptors, launched worldwide activity in organometallic chemistry related to this discovery. The second paper quantifies and explains the dramatic difference in hydrogen bond acceptor capability of fluoride ligands bound to early and late d-block metals, and demonstrates that such second-sphere coordination interactions can serve as reporters of the metal centre itself. Further publications will report quantification of hydrogen bonds or halogen bonds involving a variety of other ligands. 

B. Quantifying halogen bonds involving organic acceptor groups. 
Very significant progress has been made in meeting this objective. One of the questions regarding such halogen bonds has been whether they can be explained solely in electrostatic terms or whether (and to what extent) charge-transfer considerations are important in understanding the strength of the interactions. In a very significant paper published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's flagship journal Chemical Science, we were able to demonstrate the importance of charge-transfer contributions to strong halogen bonds and show how this leads to a very different response to solvent to that of hydrogen bonds. We have been able to build upon this finding to develop means of using solvent to control intermolecular interactions and will report these findings very soon and update this output via Researchfish. We have also been able to make progress in quantifying halogen bonds involving charged organic species and will report these results in the near future.

C. Quantitative scales for hydrogen-bond and halogen-bond donor and acceptor strengths. 
We have reported, for the first time, a comparison between hydrogen bond acceptor strengths of metal-bound ligands with organic hydrogen bond acceptors, using a single scale, the scale developed by Hunter and previously applied to organic functional groups. The results, published in Journal of the American Chemical Society, show that fluoride ligands bound to late transition metals (Ni, Pd, Pt) are as strong a hydrogen bonds acceptor as the strongest known acceptors among organic functional groups (e.g. phosphine oxides and N-oxides) and that fluoride ligands bound to early transition metals (Ti, Zr, Hf) are hydrogen bond acceptors of comparable strength to organic groups such as aniline and pyridine. We have also made significant progress in developing empirical computation models for halogen bonding that we expect in future to provide predictive capability for halogen bonding. This work requires further development and will be reported at a later stage, but the award has enabled very significant progress to be made. 

The research accomplishments have also led to a number of opportunities and invitations for members of the research team to present this work at national and international conferences, details of which are provided in other parts of the report.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The most immediate impact and opportunity to take the work forward will be come from academic scientists with interests in intermolecular interactions and self-assembly. Such scientists, however, represent a very broad community across the chemical sciences and in neighbouring disciplines of materials science, molecular biology and pharmaceutical sciences. The published work from this award, which will be augmented by further publications from the principal investigators beyond the lifetime of the award, is fundamental in nature, but provides a quantitative framework for understanding and application of intermolecular interactions, which will be applicable in the design of new materials, catalysts and pharmaceuticals, among many examples.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D437EC6F-EBBB-40EA-A176-F98FE94E1A7E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e15bb763a884.39504534</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BCE31816-9BBB-4EC2-9EFC-C94D321C042A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metal hydrides form halogen bonds: measurement of energetics of binding.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the American Chemical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/605443418fad16418b9c37d92dc83b00"><gtr:id>605443418fad16418b9c37d92dc83b00</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith DA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-7863</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546495059b4e42.35156684</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4B581811-0A76-4873-8BE1-FED6763A40B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>A solvent-resistant halogen bond</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chem.
