Hence most people will know a friend or relative living with this condition. It is the commonest cause of end stage kidney failure and lower limb amputation and diabetics are 10-20 times more likely to go blind than those without diabetes. Management of diabetes costs the National Health Service a staggering 1 million pounds per hour. Sadly no cure has been found and, despite advancements in treatment, diabetes remains a major cause of disability and death. 

Diabetes is caused by the inability of the body to respond appropriately to high blood glucose (or sugar) levels. Historically, the pancreas, an organ which lies within the abdomen and produces the hormone insulin, was believed to be the main controller of glucose balance. Insulin is a hormone which lowers blood glucose levels. Most treatments to date have been directed at the level of the pancreas. However, there is increasing evidence that certain areas within the brain, particularly an area known as the arcuate nucleus, play a key role. Within the arcuate nucleus there is an increased concentration of glucokinase. Glucokinase is an enzyme which senses and breaks down glucose thereby preventing high glucose levels building up in the bloodstream and therefore preventing the development of diabetes. However, the specific function and mechanism of action of glucokinase within the arcuate nucleus itself is not known. I aim to determine the exact role and function of glucokinase within the arcuate nucleus of rats. Rats have very similar mechanisms of appetite and glucose control to humans and therefore provide excellent models for study. Within my laboratory at Imperial College, I have worked alongside experts in this field to collect pilot data in rat models to determine whether there is any scope in exploring this avenue further. My preliminary work is very promising and shows that increased activity of the glucokinase enzyme within the arcuate nucleus area of the brain improves blood sugar levels and hence should, in theory, protect against the development of diabetes. In understanding this novel pathway within the brain I aim to investigate this area further and establish if there are new undiscovered mechanisms within the brain (rather than pancreas alone) which are involved in blood sugar control and therefore development of diabetes. Once identified, these pathways may provide targets for more optimal treatment of diabetes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In the UK over one in sixteen people have diabetes with the prevalence due to rise from 3.9 to 5 million by 2025. Diabetes has devastating complications, reduces life expectancy by up to 14 years and costs the NHS &amp;pound;23.7 billion/year. Classically, glucose homeostasis was thought to be controlled primarily by the direct secretion of insulin from the pancreas in response to blood glucose levels. Most therapies are directed here. However, recent data suggests that the central nervous system, particularly the arcuate nucleus within the hypothalamus, plays a major role in glucose homeostasis. However the precise mechanism of action is unclear. Glucokinase has an important role in glucose sensing. Within the hypothalamus, one of the main sites of glucokinase expression is the arcuate nucleus. However, its role is unknown. Investigating the effects of arcuate nucleus glucokinase using transgenic rodents is difficult since no promoters exist which allow for targeting. My group have overcome this by utilising viral rAAV encoding glucokinase to increase the expression of glucokinase confined only to the arcuate nucleus. I have carried out pilot studies to investigate the effect of increased arcuate glucokinase on glucose homeostasis using glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests. My data shows that increased arcuate glucokinase activity improves glucose tolerance to a similar magnitude to that produced by glucagon-like peptide. There was no effect on insulin tolerance. This suggests that glucokinase within the arcuate nucleus has a role in the regulation of glucose stimulated insulin release or glucose effectiveness. My pilot data supports a role for increasing glucose stimulated insulin release with increased glucokinase within the arcuate nucleus. My proposed experiments will allow me to establish whether it would be beneficial to develop glucokinase activators which access the brain as well as the periphery hence providing alternative mechanisms to treat diabetes.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will benefit a number of groups both directly and indirectly. It will be of direct benefit to pharmaceutical companies who are currently developing glucokinase activators for therapeutic use in regulating glucose homeostasis. The project will determine whether targeting of glucokinase within the hypothalamus is a useful therapeutic goal. Alternatively it could demonstrate that glucokinase activators should be developed which do not have access to the central nervous system. This information would have direct effects on the competitiveness of the activators in the market, as it would be likely to affect both the effectiveness and side effects of pharmaceutical agents. This would also benefit the public who might be treated with glucokinase activators, as the agents may have increased efficacy and reduced side effects. Some of the benefit to the pharmaceutical industry will be immediate as the data will help inform further development of glucokinase activators or choice of developmental pharmaceutical candidate compound.

The benefit to the general public is central to the aims of this project and will occur over a longer period of time. The exact timeframe is difficult to predict as it will depend on the rate of development of glucokinase activators. However, progress made in this field has the potential to reduce morbidity and potentially mortality in the diabetic population.

In addition to publication in peer reviewed journals the data will be publicised via other media sources. The Department of Investigative Medicine has a strong commitment to public engagement with science. The Department has a track record of drawing public attention to its scientific findings through both printed and broadcast media. In addition, the Department is involved in a popular Imperial College Outreach scheme which organises science education events for pre-university students, their teachers and their parents or guardians, introducing them to the science of Endocrinology and discussing the Department's latest discoveries. The Department also collaborates with the Dana Centre to promote public awareness of science. The Dana Centre is an organisation and resource designed as a forum for non-scientists to take part in exciting, informative and innovative debates about contemporary science, technology and culture. Thus we intend to publicise the results of our studies in the media in addition to specialist scientific journals, and to organise presentations on our findings via both the Outreach scheme and the Dana Centre.

The department already has a record of maximising the impact and benefit of its research. The department was the first to demonstrate that GLP-1 acted as an incretin in man and reduced food intake. GLP-1 analogues were later developed as pharmaceutical agents for use in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The department also established a spin out company Thiakis based upon the finding that a gut hormone oxyntomodulin inhibited food intake and increased energy expenditure. Thiakis developed analogues of oxyntomodulin as potential therapeutic agents which had an improved pharmacokinetic profile. Subsequently Thiakis was sold to Wyeth pharmaceuticals for &amp;pound;20 million, with &amp;pound;80 million potential performance related payments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>286543</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD6E6055-F9B9-4D96-8D0C-272F1FC04D09</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reply: Clinical trial registry alone is not adequate: on the perception of possible endpoint switching and P-hacking.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Human reproduction (Oxford, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6b06b2687dfc71393850fb57e8b209f4"><gtr:id>6b06b2687dfc71393850fb57e8b209f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbara A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0268-1161</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa904c2858909.18572400</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8F68D144-941C-427D-8C1A-49C8D89FB4D3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Carbohydrate craving: not everything is sweet.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/417d43a7089aa342f399b24e0f14fc1c"><gtr:id>417d43a7089aa342f399b24e0f14fc1c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ma Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1363-1950</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa90498cce895.16654370</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N020472/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
