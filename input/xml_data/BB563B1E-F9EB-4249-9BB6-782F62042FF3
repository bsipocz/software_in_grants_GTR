At a time dominated by US vision and power, this programme seeks how to present a different interpretation and experience of global events and political identity, and thus a different vision of how the world might be organised.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196289</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit of the foreign professor to the Department of Geography, University of Ostrava, Czech Republic.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F13B9AB4-A138-4CCD-918B-331CBE65F2E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research seminar (staff and postgraduate students) and lecture (to undergraduates) on Subaltern Geopolitics, University of Ostrava, Czech Republic.

As intended, the fellowship provided the opportunity to draw together two different strands of previous research into a new research direction. This has led to publications and invitations, as outlined in other entries to Researchfish, allowing me to speak with wider academic audiences (I have been invited to speak to various research groups in postcolonialism, political science, development and area studies, in addition to human geography).

In addition to these new research developments, the fellowship supported the development of skills (including language training) and contacts within the region, leading to further research activity in Northern Tanzania. This has impact on the development of new interdisciplinary research in the region, specifically the development of a qualitative social science contribution towards health research in the form of two new grants (one a consortium grant on which I am co-PI) supported by the Zoonoses of Emerging Livestock Systems (funded by DfID and RCUK). These grants involve capacity building with colleagues in Tanzania, both through the development of research expertise in country (there is a particular shortage of trained qualitative social scientists in Tanzania) and through support for associated masters and PhD students.

The impact of the research undertaken as part of the fellowship beyond the academy is yet to materialise. The main planned impact pathway is through communicating results about alternative ways of thinking about geopolitical relations through the media. The media training I received as part of the fellowship has helped me understand the best way to prepare pitches and I have had initial discussions with BBC radio producers about making a programme about postcolonial Tanzania. I am working towards producing something for broadcast in 2017 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Arusha Declaration.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CF9117FB-CC42-4438-9051-70FF7E3F6210</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>544fc6ef1c64b5.32757129</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Fellowship outcomes
- media training courses by the ESRC and from The Guardian: I have now published my first media piece and have been in discussion with a senior producer at the BBC about a radio documentary from the fellowship research; 
- language training: from being a complete novice at the start of the fellowship, I have successfully completed both the intermediate and advanced Swahili courses at the respected languge training centre at Usa River, northern Tanzania. 
- developing research in East Africa: I currently am Co-I on two interdisciplinary grants, where I am leading the social sciences component, and have just been awarded another two. One of these, a research programme grant from the DfID-RCUK Zoonoses of Emerging Livestock Systems call, sees me as joint-PI with an epidemiologist, recognising the truly interdisciplinary nature of the research. The time afforded by the fellowship gave me the opportunity to deveop these relationships and establish the central importance of qualitative social science approaches to research into health and poverty in Africa. 

The research component of the fellowship sought to examine postcolonial political identity in Tanzania through the analysis of the geographical imagination projected through both formal and popular geopolitics during various periods since independence:
1. Analysis of Nyerere's writings has exposed a challenging post-colonial geopolitical view that is still evident in contemporary Tanzanian geopolitics. Due to the late start of the fellowship, I was able to add an examination of the 50th anniversaries of both uhuru (independence) for Tanganyika and the union with Zanzibar to form modern-day Tanzania. This has highlighted the tension in contemporary Tanzania between wanting to celebrate the legacy of Nyerere's vision and acknowledging the challenges facing Tanzanian society in the neoliberal world order. This has allowed me to effectively close the circle, starting from the optimistic projections of the Arusha Declaration, and ending with the reflections on this process half a century later.
2. Geopolitics is not only made by great leaders but is remade and experienced through the everyday. The University of Dar es Salaam in the period between the Arusha Declaration and the mid 19080s was a place within which Nyerere's vision was discussed and debated, where a new university was being formed, and where the everyday impacts of Nyerere's policies were experienced. Interviews with those who participated in the establishment of the new university, from Tanzania and far beyond, have provided an important complement to the official narrative examined in 1 above to understand everyday responses to official policy, but also offers a perhaps unique understanding of a situation within which people were trying to rethink and remake the world order too. However, while it was clearly a heady intellectual period, it was also apparently one where some of the tensions running through Nyerere's vision were made evident, pressure to achieve African socialism led to repression, women were often absent from debates, and it was one where conflicts sometimes emerged between the radical ambitions of those from around the world who came to participate, and the colonial experience which had meant the need for foreign staff to build the new nation. 
3. Considering more contemporary geopolitics, reading key English and Swahili language media has highlighted a very different narrative of the &amp;quot;war on terror&amp;quot; to that which dominated mainstream western accounts - one that feared more from the US reprisals than it did from terrorism and that pushed for compassion and understanding rather than revenge.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The media and, to a large extent, academic, reporting of current geopolitics are strongly shaped by western perspectives and concerns. Traditionally, geopolitics has been limited to the thoughts and actions of great powers as it is these powers which shape the majority of events. However, it is important to understand the security concerns of non-hegemonic states too, in order to make sense of and anticipate their responses to events. I hope that dissemination through academic and media pathways will help to stimulate a questioning of the taken-for-granted western geopolitical imagination.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1D9A155C-D199-4D21-BA5F-2F9EB614F2A2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544fc69b270f87.78725135</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>85113D96-ED36-4E5A-B021-4333973F2EFA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Subaltern Geographies.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fa41fae978b2a6ff3019a307f83a2d45"><gtr:id>fa41fae978b2a6ff3019a307f83a2d45</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sharp  J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56b9f03a255948.45389902</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F73882B8-C144-4A8E-9264-FDD6EB1AEEE4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Driving improvements in emerging disease surveillance through locally relevant capacity strengthening.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science (New York, N.Y.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/daf010182a5cd2bc9bffd6bed9d63e36"><gtr:id>daf010182a5cd2bc9bffd6bed9d63e36</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Halliday JEB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0036-8075</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a6615eb118215.99998053</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>34999CF6-CA8C-43AC-BCFC-1EB3604655B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxford Handbook of Postcolonial Studies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e6c37b716b42c1a727d5dde24ccd6cdc"><gtr:id>e6c37b716b42c1a727d5dde24ccd6cdc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Joanne Sharp</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-19-958825-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>541989f0ea5609.14692350</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>56A10C93-3535-420A-A18B-DAEDFD65C9BE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Geopolitics at the margins?
