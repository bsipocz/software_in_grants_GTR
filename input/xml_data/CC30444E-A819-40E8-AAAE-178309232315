The term 'sacred' is sometimes treated as synonymous with 'religion', but this project will explore an alternative understanding of the sacred originating from the work of Emile Durkheim in which the sacred is understood as a symbol, value, idea or person which is regarded as being of profound significance, and in relation to which emotionally-laden social bonds and practices are forged.\n\nDeveloping a sociological theory of the sacred has significant potential to clarify the focus of the sociology of religion in the West. Since the 1960's, a primary concern in this discipline has been how to understand the study of 'religion' in societies in which increasing numbers of people have little or no meaningful contact with traditional religious institutions or practices. This has led to a wide range of theoretical and empirical studies examining new religious movements, the 'new age', neo-Paganism and Wicca, as well as different forms of spirituality beyond insitutional religion. Whilst valuable, the networks and practices analysed in this literature tend to involve only a very small proportion of the population, often smaller than those involved in traditional religions. By contrast, a sociological understanding of the sacred can provide a conceptual language for analysing socially significant meanings, values and relationships that are embedded into key social structures such as public media and the legal-system, and with which significant parts of Western populations are engaged.\n\nThe project will examine how ideas of the sacred have been developed in fields beyond the study of religion, particularly in cultural sociology, anthropology and media studies, whilst also considering how recent work in religious studies on religion and intersubjectivity, and the cultural mediation of religion, might generate richer understandings of the sacred in these other disciplines. It will give particular attention to the intersubjective significance of relations with sacred figures, to the historical contingency of sacred forms, to the key role of contemporary media as a structure through which forms of the sacred are rehearsed and contested, and to the possibilities and challenges of collective forms of the sacred in pluralist societies. Case examples discussed through the project will include the significance of the collective, mediated mourning of the death of public figures such as Anna Lindh and Pym Fortuyn, the emergence of the sacrality of the care of children as a key form of the sacred in Western societies which has to a significant degree displaced traditional religious sources of authority, and the ways in which controversy over the BBC's decision not to broadcast the DEC Gaza appeal demonstrates tensions in the role of public media in rehearsing sacred values whilst also maintaining impartiality.\n\nIn addition to its academic outputs, the project will also seek to encourage engagement with such a sociological understanding of the sacred amongst a range of public audiences through media outputs and other events. This conceptual langugage provides a useful framework for thinking about the roots and implications of our deepest commitments, for identifying operative forms of the sacred in contemporary culture, and for moving beyond simplistic binaries of religion and the secular in defining significant motive-forces in contemporary social life. By introducing these concepts to wider public audiences, this project therefore has the potential to create a framework for a new kind of public reflection about the implications of living in a society characterised by multiple, intersecting and conflicting forms of the sacred.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is considerable interest and concern across a range of public audiences about the nature and possibilities of collective meanings and values in contemporary society. Behind public debates on issues such as citizenship; religion, atheism and secularism; the demoralization of society; the challenges of religious and cultural pluralism; religious fundamentalism and 'radicalization'; and the sources of public meaning in increasingly de-Christianised societies, lie more fundamental questions about what collective meanings and values operate in contemporary society, and whether these have the potential to bind people into a constructive social order or degenerate into on-going conflict and violence. Whilst these questions have become a primary focus for a range of disciplines across the humanities and social sciences, they also find expression in political debates and policy initiatives, as well as mediated public discussions ranging from issues of blaspemy and freedom of speech to whether football or clubbing constitutes a new form of 'religion' in an increasingly secularised society.\n\nA central aim of this fellowship is to encourage the use of the concept of the sacred as a way of framing public discussion around these fundamental issues of collective meanings, values and relationships. This conceptual language (when detached from the simple association of the 'sacred' with 'religion') has the potential to enable people to reflect on their most profound commitments which often elude such reflection through being so deeply embedded in the cultural and emotional structures of contemporary subjectivities. In doing so, it has the potential to create a conceptual framework for thinking about how forms of the sacred are not universal and timeless, but historically-contingent and socially-performed, as well as the implications of this for the forms of sacred that we wish to nurture through collective social and cultural practices. It also has the potential to create a conceptual space in which profound commitments can be thought about in a way that does not immediately revert to simplistic binaries of religion and the secular, in which it is assumed that the core values of religious and secular lives are both self-evident and inevitably antagonistic. By introducing this conceptual language of the sacred into discussions across a range of public contexts, the project can also stimulate more specific questions such as where we find compelling representations of the sacred in contemporary media and culture, and the nature and possibility of shared public sacred space in contemporary pluralist society.\n\nTo achieve this aim of introducing this conceptual language to a range of public audiences, this project will therefore involve:\n\ni) writing of a short popular book, presenting key ideas from the academic monograph produced through this project for a wider non-academic audience\nii) the production of a programme or short programmes for BBC Radio 4 on the sacred in contemporary culture\niii) a series of film screenings, framed by the project's conceptual language of the sacred, at which public figures discuss the representation of the sacred in particular films\niv) holding a seminar/workshop with a leading think-tank with strong links to policy-makers and others involved in different forms of public and cultural life on the sacred in a culturally pluralist society, supported by that think-tank's own strong dissemination structures.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54933</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>55000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Collaborative Doctoral Award Scheme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/L011735/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>11C2E07F-99EB-4877-B29B-A42D7E0C6EE4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54634281587231.86908520</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>79740</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Follow-On Funding Scheme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/M001989/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>ECAE58E1-E137-4E87-AA21-EA870BBF2519</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546341fae03a26.42469168</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>? Ten articles were written by Gordon Lynch for print and on-line media with national and international profiles: 
a) 'Phone hacking and sacrilege' was uploaded onto the Guardian Comment is Free website on 8 July 2011, and reprinted in the Saturday print edition of the Guardian on 9 July 2011 (250,000 copies sold). The Guardian played a leading role in the coverage of the phone-hacking scandal during that week, following the publication of its story about the hacking of Millie Dowler's phone on 5 July, and this comment piece was one of a select number of opinion pieces chosen for publication by the Guardian during the height of public interest in this story.
b) six blog pieces on the relevance of Durkheim's concept of the sacred for understanding contemporary society were published as part of the 'How to Believe' series for the Guardian Comment is Free website from 10 December 2012 to 14 January 2013. Comment is Free does not provide details of individual page hits but has said that each post has, on average, 10,000 readers. These articles received a total of 1076 comments on the Guardian website by 31 July 2013. 
c) 'Shamed media: News Corp, the profane and the sacred' and 'Remapping space in the wake of violence' (on the murders committed by Anders Behring Brievik) were published on 13 July 2011 and 29 July 2011 respectively, on The Revealer website, a public engagement project run by the Center for Media and Religion at New York University.
d) 'Re-discovering values after the English riots' was published on the Open Democracy website on 17 August 2011.

? Gordon Lynch was invited by the RSA to give a lecture, on 17 October 2011, with Prof. Jeffrey Alexander on 'The Power of the Sacred' to an audience of more than 200 RSA Fellows. An audio podcast and edited film of this event were subsequently uploaded onto the RSA website and the RSA's Youtube channel. Lynch was also an invited speaker at the Hay Literary Festival Fringe, on 4 June 2012, on a panel discussion of journalism after the phone-hacking scandal chaired by Samira Ahmed (BBC), which also included Yasmin Alibah-Brown (national columnist), John Tomlinson (QC for victims of phone hacking) and John Kampfner (former editor of the New Statesman), a film of which was subsequently made available online by the event organizers.

? Four on-line films, 'What is Sacred?', 'The Cult of the Child' (on the sacralization of the care of children), 'One Hour to Save the Nation' (on the sacralization of nationalism and human rights) and 'Is Nature Sacred?', were produced by Gordon Lynch in conjunction with Truetube, an award-winning provider of free on-line educational materials for religious education, PSHE and citizenship education at Keystages 3 and 4. These films were uploaded to Truetube's website with associated lesson plans in October 2011. A launch event for the films was held at Lambeth Palace on 1 February 2012, and attendees included the Chair of the RE Council, a representative of the National Association of SACRE's, as well as members of local SACRE's, teachers and journalists who write on on-line educational materials.

? On the basis of his lecture at the RSA, Lynch was appointed in 2012 as one of the lead advisers for a research programme on the significance of spirituality and the sacred in contemporary society currently being undertaken within the Social Brain Centre at the RSA. He advised the Centre on a successful application for funding for the project from the Templeton Foundation and his work was cited in an early article on this project written by the Centre's Director, Dr Jonathan Rowson, in July 2013 for the RSA's quarterly journal. The journal is available online as well as being circulated to its 27,000 Fellows who are based in 80 countries around the world.

Reach of impact:

The extent of public engagement with these impact activities is indicated by the following:

? The print version of the 'Phone hacking and sacrilege' article and seven articles for the Guardian Comment is Free website alone are likely to have had a minimum of 150,000-200,000 readers.

? Truetube estimate that by 31 July 2013, around 57,000 Keystage 3 and 4 students in the UK had watched the films on the sacred.

? By 31 July 2013 the film of the 'Power of the Sacred' lecture had been viewed 9,878 times on the RSA's Youtube channel with 107 'likes'.

? In addition to first viewings of this material, on-line articles and films were re-circulated by users through other sites. Details of the articles in the Comment is Free 'How to Believe' series were, for example, posted 271 times on to individual Facebook pages and 232 times on individual Twitter accounts. In one instance, the third blog in this series, on sacred ritual, was tweeted by Sonali Ranade in India to her 35,537 followers, with her describing it as a 'searing insight' into morally-charged public protest in the context of the mass protests in response to the Dehli rape case in December 2012. 

? These figures suggest that a minimum 250,000-300,000 people are likely to have read or viewed one or more of these impact materials on the cultural sociology of the sacred.

Significance of impact:

The overall aim of the impact activities was to encourage more widespread use of a cultural sociological understanding of the sacred to interpret contemporary social life. This change was evident in audience responses that indicated that this framework was understood and perceived as interesting, useful and worthy of serious discussion:

? The online films produced in conjunction with Truetube were named 'Humanities resource of the week' in the 17 February 2012 issue of the Times Educational Supplement, with the editor writing that the 'films are fascinating and explore how the sacred can be both profound and problematic'.

? In an evaluation of the Truetube films with Year 10 GCSE Religious Studies students, respondents commented that they had learned from watching and talking about the films that the 'sacred is not all about God and religion', 'it allows you to critically think about &amp;quot;religion&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sacred&amp;quot; and compare what the two mean and whether sacred should always be linked to religion', 'it helps us to see what is important in our lives', it made 'us question what is important, sacred to us', and that 'the sacred can be used to describe a thought or feeling not just an object'.

? Material produced through impact activities (i-iii) above was circulated and re-used on other websites. Lynch (2012a) was cited as a key text on a resource page on the sacred on the website Philosophy Talk.Org, a public out-reach programme of Stanford University. The RSA film, 'The Power of the Sacred', was also adapted as an educational resource on the leading American educational website, TED-ED.com. Two of the Guardian 'How to Believe' articles on Durkheim were reproduced in full on the website for the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University which circulates resources for policy-makers and policy advisers. 

? Lynch (2012a) was described as a 'lucid reconsideration of the term &amp;quot;sacred&amp;quot;' by Bernice Martin in the Times Literary Supplement. The Truetube films were described as 'intriguing and explore how the sacred can be both profound and problematic [in ways that are] accessible for a teenage audience' by the national religious education magazine, SACRE News (vol. 12, p. 13) and as 'an excellent resource to kick-start debates in lessons and perhaps unexpectedly bring together the subjects of RE, PSHE and Citizenship by taking a modern approach to asking the question, &amp;quot;what is sacred?&amp;quot;' by bee-it.co.uk, a leading website for the use of technological resources in the education sector.

? Positive comments about impact materials and activites were also made by other readers. On his blog (19 August 2011), the journalist Mark Vernon wrote that 'Gordon Lynch has penned an excellent piece for Open Democracy on the riots and the habits of virtue', and tweeted this comment to his 497 followers on Twitter. Comments on 'The Power of the Sacred' film left on on Youtube also indicated that many viewers had understood and welcomed this analytical framework. As one respondent wrote, 'the video shows how important the sacred is to our very secular lives. [It] is the unconscious of society.'

? Stuart Porter, Director of Innovation and Development at Truetube, has written that 'the subject matter of the sacred films was extremely interesting to us, and we felt that it would be a strong addition to the RE section of our site. The films took a sideways look at religion and religious behaviour that was a refreshing departure from the usual knowledge-based films we have for Religious Education. The films encourage higher-level thinking in pupils, in terms of understanding the content, in reflecting upon it, and applying it. Pupils sometimes question why they are studying a religion they don't believe in, but seeing the world in terms of what is deemed &amp;quot;sacred&amp;quot; and what is thought of as &amp;quot;profane&amp;quot; helps teachers to explain the importance of deeply held beliefs whether they are religious or secular, and how they might affect a person's or a society's behaviour'. Neil McKain, Head of Religious Studies and Philosophy at John Hampden Grammar School in High Wycombe, similarly commented that the films 'ask profound questions about whether or not religion is the same as sacred and whether or not religions 'own' sacred anymore. The tone of the film on children as sacred clearly engaged my class and, though entertained by it, they came up with some incredibly thoughtful responses afterwards'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>27771DAA-D2B4-4053-B6EC-95C9425FD6D6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d99cd57a1470.40409222</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has developed a way of thinking about how Emile Durkheim's concept of the sacred (as a 'thing set' apart that becomes the focus for communal ritual and emotion and helps to define a sense of moral community and collective identity) can be used to study contemporary societies.

More specifically, the project:

i) distinguished between two different ways of thinking about the sacred in the study of religion (the ontological/mystical and cultural sociological approaches), clarifying the very different connotations of the term 'sacred' in these two approaches. The project also demonstrated how this cultural sociological approach to the sacred extends the questions and boundaries of what we consider to be appropriate subjects for study within 'religious' studies.

ii) provided a genealogy of how the cultural sociology of the sacred had developed since the work of Durkheim, primarily with reference to an Anglo-American tradition of scholarship led by Edward Shils, Robert Bellah and Jeffrey Alexander

iii) provided an account of the methodology of this approach to studying the sacred, involving reflection on specific social and historical cases in relation to key theoretical concepts

iv) demonstrated how sacred forms are shifting, historical constructions and that modern societies are characterised not by single forms of the sacred around which the whole of society draws its moral focus, but a plurality of different sacred forms which exist in complex relationships to each other.

v) discussed how humanitarianism and nationalism have become dominant sacred forms within modern societies.

vi) engaged with forms of mediatization theory to argue that public and social media have become key social sites for public engagement with contemporary sacred forms

vii) argued for the importance of critical reflection of the effects of sacred moral sentiments on social action, with particular reference to the ways in which they might legitimise actions that are violent or uncivil.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work has already been used by others as a theoretical reference point for thinking about how deeply-charged moral commitments and emotions are produced and enacted in contemporary societies. This has included work on the sacralization of the care of children in contemporary society, sacred symbolism in nationalisms, the study of media as sites for the circulation of sacred forms, 'secular' sacred values, deeply-charged moral conflicts over symbolically important sites (such as the 'Ground Zero Mosque'), terrorism and environmental ethics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>223A7F37-3E80-4370-8304-F72FCB583B6F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d99bded03334.96825352</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2012/06/09/book-review-the-sacred-in-the-modern-world/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6E5D7BDD-9F86-4C1D-B82D-AD708181A95C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The sociology of the sacred: A conversation with Jeffrey Alexander</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Culture and Religion</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5886a43733834d11ea0b378bc092f471"><gtr:id>5886a43733834d11ea0b378bc092f471</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lynch G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54633cee292083.19283043</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E7B0A578-1A03-434A-9958-DE921D120D54</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Sacred in the Modern World: A Cultural Sociological Approach</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/435acdf9dad09f26b3413c54e464d325"><gtr:id>435acdf9dad09f26b3413c54e464d325</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lynch, G.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978220198705215</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54633bcc288f77.43013128</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>97D77954-0446-4C12-929C-858AC98907F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social Media and Religious Change -</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5886a43733834d11ea0b378bc092f471"><gtr:id>5886a43733834d11ea0b378bc092f471</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lynch G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-3110270457</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>546340c04e45d1.38221165</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4DFE1A4D-E79D-4D54-B616-830500B4DC00</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the Sacred</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ba44e795c5efa7a544961b68ff89eb40"><gtr:id>ba44e795c5efa7a544961b68ff89eb40</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lynch Gordon</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781844655342</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54633c1bf36961.40914728</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H037012/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>CC30444E-A819-40E8-AAAE-178309232315</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/H037012/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>54933.0</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2011-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>2EC2F01F-0372-435E-85C0-1A039BB1EC2D</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/H037012/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>41099.64</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>961683C0-A096-43FA-8662-390E7C2040DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Modern Theology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
