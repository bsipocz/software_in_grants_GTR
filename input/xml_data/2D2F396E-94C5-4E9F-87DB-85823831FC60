To-date, our insights can be understood in terms of what is known as the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) in which Nature at its most fundamental level is described by point-particles. This theory is very successful and has been verified experimentally to great accuracy. However, many people believe that it is not the final word in this area. It does not, for example, say anything about the most obvious of everyday forces - gravity. In recent years, String Theory - where the fundamental objects are pieces of string as opposed to point-particles - has emerged as one of the most promising candidates to go 'beyond' the SM and resolve many of the problems that are encountered including that of the incorporation of gravity. In doing so, it makes some remarkable new predictions too such as the number of dimensions of our universe being greater than the usual four of which we are aware, although such ideas are hard to test experimentally. String theory, however, has many other facets. One of these is the surprising realisation that certain string theories actually describe the same physics as certain four-dimensional theories of particle physics despite living in a higher-dimensional space. These theories of particle physics are typically directly- or closely-related to certain parts of the SM, and it is in this area of the interplay between string theory and particle physics that my research is focussed. There is much that goes into understanding a theory, but at the end of the day one must measure some quantities which one extracts from it in order to test the theory with experiment. In theories of particle physics, such quantities are known as scattering amplitudes which describe the interactions of fundamental particles. These in themselves can be very hard to extract, and my work to-date has been in understanding such quantities and how they may be extracted more effieciently in theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) - the theory of the Strong Nuclear Force - and other closely related theories. This work was largely inspired by a particular relation between a string theory known as Twistor String Theory and a theory of particle physics that is closely-related to QCD but is in some respects easier to understand. The relation between the two is known as a duality, and has been very useful in understanding and calculating quantities such as scattering amplitudes that will be relevant to discovering new physics at particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider which is due to start taking data soon. However, the duality is not completely understood and has some problems associated with it - in-particular when one considers the way in which it is affected by Quantum Mechanics. A full quantum mechanical understanding of it would greatly help to improve our understanding of QCD and the theories to which it is related and ultimately in the discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model. By looking at these quantum issues in my proposed research I hope to make progress in this direction. In addition to this, I am very interested in singularities in space-time such as the Big Bang singularity. Significant progress has been made over the last years in understanding singularities such as those inside Black Holes, particularly in string theory, but Big Bang singularities are different to these and are less-well understood. Recently, however, a singularity of the Big Bang type has been found which is in-principle understandable because one can find a theory describing it which does not break down at that point. I would like to investigate the nature of this singularity further, and again look at quantum effects in-particular in order to further our understanding of this type of singularity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>217384</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C911693D-88C7-45B5-9BB2-83BA26686A95</gtr:id><gtr:title>A note on quantum aspects of multiple membranes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PHYSICS LETTERS B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0a98b66fe69ce27dc32aebf4c1575926"><gtr:id>0a98b66fe69ce27dc32aebf4c1575926</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bedford James</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0370-2693</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>50f06661dd390</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A9A6255B-5E0D-435E-BC77-6F0186982D12</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Introduction to String Theory</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>e-Print</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3f576cccc28c584b5552d732db069f70"><gtr:id>3f576cccc28c584b5552d732db069f70</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bedford, James</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>oQByCLajkGX</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">PP/E005233/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A50650F5-D901-49C3-AA30-F625AC696676</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle Astrophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C2898760-D7E5-4B25-A236-E7869CD74F88</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - experiment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>200B9B9B-68EC-4D70-B889-6BD5F4538080</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Beyond the Standard Model</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>760D5B7E-1353-4BD7-8172-CFFC4A254A5C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cosmology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C5529360-827A-4C08-881B-88F10B12ADDD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Data Handling &amp; Storage</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EE2392F-9964-4A0B-8C0A-1672FD744F8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Extra-Galactic Astron.&amp;Cosmol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC478D98-EB7D-4905-B536-D9D61AFD07E4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Galactic &amp; Interstellar Astron</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
