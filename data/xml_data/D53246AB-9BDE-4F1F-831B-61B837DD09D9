&lt;p>In this project we develop a methodological approach to analyse policy changes by relaxing the strong assumptions of RE while retaining the appealing feature of forward looking behaviour. We assume that agents have incomplete knowledge of the underlying economy and form forecasts of variables by using actual data. This adaptive learning approach is typically backward looking and is not suitable for analysing announced future policy changes. The project rectifies this weakness and the proposed methodology allows agents to be forward looking in an incomplete knowledge setting.&amp;nbsp;The methodology is used to analyse systematically the impact of fiscal policy changes in micro-founded economics models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Surprisingly, the output multipliers for government purchases are significantly higher under learning compared to RE and fall within empirical bounds reported in the literature.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>211604</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Policy makers find the &amp;quot;adaptive learning&amp;quot; approach used in the project attractive. At the same time, institutions like central banks are very secretive about the way they arrive at policy choices (like setting interest rates); so the impact from the research is necessarily indirect. One piece of evidence is in the speeches of prominent policy makers. For instance, (former) Chairman of the Federal Reserve in a speech in 2007 remarked, &amp;quot;In sum, many of the most interesting issues in contemporary monetary theory require an analytical framework that involves learning by private agents and possibly the central bank as well.&amp;quot; Monetary policy is an area where different types of models are heavily used and their results are one input to the policy decisions. 
It is to be noted that one of the project co-authors, Dr Honkapohja, is a Member of the Policy Board, Bank of Finland, which participates in European Central Bank (ECB) policy making. Impact can be enhanced by Dr Honkapohja's direct involvement in the community of top level central bankers. The relevant results from this research can be disseminated to policy making not only through public conferences and workshops but also in closed or confidential meetings and workshops.
The impact of this research should furthermore be seen by virtue of pioneering a plausible approach to analyse policy changes under bounded rationality in macroeconomics; this approach in turn has led to a large outgrowth of economic models used in recent policy making. Of course, the impact is largely through user engagement in policy circles. 
The findings in the grant provide support for the fiscal stimulus packages adopted in countries in the aftermath of the recent Great Recession. Related findings have been presented, for instance, at the 2012 Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) of St Louis Conference on &amp;quot;Expectations in Dynamic Macroeconomic Models&amp;quot; where the Presidents of the FRBs of San Francisco and St Louis were in attendance. 
This approach has led to an analysis of problems that arise from the economy being stuck in a state where there are major concerns for deflation; this was a major headache for the US Federal Reserve in early 2000s and now for the ECB. Work by Mitra's co-authors (Evans and Honkapohja) on this topic &amp;quot;Expectations, deflation traps and macroeconomic policy&amp;quot; has received widespread attention at conferences eg. at the Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank in 2009 and at the Erasmus University in 2010 that were attended by prominent policy makers. 
Whether governments should undertake fiscal stimulus to increase output or engage in austerity because of concerns about debt has been briefly addressed in the project. It is shown that the empirical effects of some expansionary consolidations are well captured by the assumption of adaptive learning. Further work by Benhabib, Evans and Honkapohja &amp;quot;Liquidity Traps and Expectation Dynamics: Fiscal Stimulus or Fiscal Austerity&amp;quot; analyses the effects of fiscal policies in the New Keynesian model when interest rates are held at low levels by the central bank; these findings have been presented at the FRB St Louis workshop in 2012 and the Bank of Spain Workshop in 2013.
More recently, prominent policy makers have pointed to weaknesses in the current monetary policy regime of inflation targeting as a way to combat the Great Recession since 2008, especially in circumstances when interest rates are held at very low levels for a prolonged period of time. Current policy regimes have not been successful in tacking the severe problems of low growth and unemployment. Key policymakers have, hence, voiced support for alternative frameworks like price level and nominal GDP targeting; these include the Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, and the President and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Charles Evans. In work with Honkapohja, Mitra is currently examining these alternative frameworks using the approach of the grant. This work is expected to have future impact in policy circles. 
There is also ongoing work by Evans, Honkapohja and Mitra in analysing the effects of fiscal policies in realistic frameworks that have been adopted in recent policy design i.e. the New Keynesian model. Fiscal policies have been widely adopted by major countries as a way to combat the Great Recession (especially in the wake of the failure of current monetary policies to alleviate the crisis). There are plans to study the effectiveness of fiscal policies in situations when interest rates are low and expectations of the private sector about the economy are very pessimistic (as has been true since 2008). Will fiscal policies be able to bring the economy out of stagnation in such recessionary situations? Preliminary results are exciting! If the fiscal stimulus is small, then policies may be ineffective but if the stimulus is large then they have a chance to succeed. This analysis will be done in detail in future work.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FB2FA920-ED25-417C-86E5-E120576F53AC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5458ab2da99ca5.42826784</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Economists do not have good theoretical models to analyse the effect of macroeconomic policy changes. The existing paradigm, rational expectations (RE), assumes complete knowledge of the underlying model structure for economic agents and policymakers, both before and after the policy change. While the informational assumptions of RE are very unrealistic, an appealing feature is that agents look forward and react plausibly to future announcements immediately. 
This project extends the widely popular adaptive learning approach used in macroeconomics to analyse future policy changes by relaxing the strong assumptions of RE while retaining the appealing feature of forward looking behaviour. This modification tackles a common criticism of the adaptive learning approach in that it is not well suited to examine policy changes given its inherent backward looking character. Armed with this methodology one may examine changes in fiscal policy (eg. changes in income tax rates) that are announced by the government to take place in the future and the consequent implications of these policies in terms of GDP. 
Several topics of interest were studied. One major objective was to provide a systematic analysis of temporary and permanent changes in fiscal policy in stochastic micro-founded economic models. This objective was met in &amp;quot;Policy Changes and Learning in a RBC model&amp;quot; published as a lead article in the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control. 
One of the important steps taken to fight the Great Recession was to undertake various fiscal measures (especially in the wake of the inability of monetary policy to improve economic prospects). The findings in the project showed that fiscal measures may be effective in raising output and the measures of fiscal policy effectiveness obtained using this approach fall within empirical bounds reported in the literature, in sharp contrast to the implausibly low values obtained under RE.
The methodology developed has the potential to be used in a wide variety of other contexts. Some European governments are contemplating or have (like Germany recently) adopted various market reforms to make labour markets more flexible. These policy measures can be assessed using the adaptive learning approach developed here and there is work in progress by Mitra and co-authors along these lines. There is also work in progress to examine alternative monetary policies which is described elsewhere under key findings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The major aim was to pioneer an approach to analyse policy changes in micro founded economic models using the adaptive learning approach.

This approach is very general and has uses elsewhere in the fields of macroeconomic policy. Key policy makers have expressed reservations about the ability of the current policy regime of inflation targeting to tackle deep recessions. They have voiced their support for alternative policies like price level and nominal GDP targeting, policies which are also been discussed in internal memos in central banks. Honkapohja and Mitra have ongoing work to examine these policies. Effectiveness of fiscal policies in times when interest rates are low is also under investigation by Mitra and co-authors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5513E184-0A4C-436C-A5FA-72DC23A94DB6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54526130632362.30072107</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0DC58820-098F-4F7F-B1CC-E76E527E66FB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Policy change and learning in the RBC model</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c88025b294230afb6f2e5879702cd45a"><gtr:id>c88025b294230afb6f2e5879702cd45a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mitra K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf92f920bab84a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C1C98623-04FC-458F-AC51-9E12D76DE05A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fiscal Policy Multipliers in an RBC Model with Learning</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Macroeconomic Dynamics forthcoming</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c88025b294230afb6f2e5879702cd45a"><gtr:id>c88025b294230afb6f2e5879702cd45a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mitra K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_6674767474cade88f4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2D4AF207-B01C-43C1-8120-16ECCACF3F43</gtr:id><gtr:title>E-stability in the stochastic Ramsey model</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Economics Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/63f675e73a25241c18b44a01178848db"><gtr:id>63f675e73a25241c18b44a01178848db</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf8ff8ff08e1e3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>62F12C53-BF5A-4019-83B7-62A10FD4474B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Does Ricardian Equivalence Hold When Expectations Are Not Rational?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Money, Credit and Banking</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b93b3401f579537410d4f6e6eab162c7"><gtr:id>b93b3401f579537410d4f6e6eab162c7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>EVANS G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfa4fa4f9b0efd</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/H037632/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-2617</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
