Families are therefore becoming increasingly dependent upon women's labour income, especially during the recent economic crisis (Harkness 2013). However, we do not know much about why female-breadwinner families emerge, and what implications they bring about.

AIMS &amp;amp; OBJECTIVES: This project will provide a detailed overview of female-breadwinner families in Europe and study the social and demographic outcomes that this change brings about for women, men and children. This will be the first project of its kind. It will have three main themes: 

1. The emergence of a female-breadwinner model over time and space
-Which are the forerunner countries and regions in the emergence of female-breadwinner families and when did the female-breadwinner family started to emerge in Europe?
-Which institutional, normative and structural contexts facilitate the emergence of female-breadwinner families?
This phase of the project will benefit from research visits: Professors Esping-Andersen (UPF) and Van Bavel (University of Leuven), will mentor the PI on the relevant sociological theories of gender and power. Susan Harkness (University of Bath) will provide mentoring on how to treat income variables. Spatial econometric techniques and multilevel modelling will be applied and household income data will be gathered from the Luxembourg Income Study.

2. The drivers leading to the emergence of female-breadwinner families 
-Why do women become breadwinners? 
-Are female-breadwinner families prevalent among specific social classes and ethnic groups? 
-Have the characteristics of female-breadwinner families changed over time?
These questions will be answered using Understanding Society data, which provides longitudinal data on labour income of both partners, and applying fixed effects panel models, which allow controlling for unobserved individual heterogeneity. Regression analyses on International Social Survey Programme data will be employed to show how preferences and socio-demographic characteristics have changed between 1988 and 2012.

3. The implications of the emergence of female-breadwinner families
-Are female-breadwinner families more at risk of union dissolution? This question will be answered in colaboration with Prof. Esping-Andersen during a research visit at UPF.
-Is the housework and childcare tasks allocation different in female-breadwinner families with respect to male-breadwinner and equal-earner families? 
-Do women and men in female-breadwinner families have lower realized and intended fertility? This question will be answered in collaboration with Dr Testa during a research visit at VID. 
-Do women, men and children in female-breadwinner families have lower levels of wellbeing and happiness? 
These questions will be answered using data from Understanding Society and the Millennium Cohort Study (which provides information on happiness and wellbeing explicitly asked to children, in addition to parents). Fixed effects panel models will be employed.

POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS &amp;amp; BENEFITS: The project will provide the first solid analysis in an area that, given the increasing educational attainment and earning potential of women, is likely to become even more prominent in the future and that will have implications for the European and national political agenda. Research findings will be: 
-useful for UK and international policy makers in shaping family, employment and gender-egalitarian policies
-useful for the third sector by providing individual charities with the information needed to understand the changing dynamics of relationships, wellbeing, and risk of divorce for modern families
-relevant for members of the public by increasing awareness of the changing economic role of women in modern families.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project aims to provide the first cross-country study on the causes and consequences of the emergence of female-breadwinner families in Europe, an area that has recently received increased interest from policy makers at the national and EU level setting policies aimed at increasing female labour force participation and achieving gender equality. This area is likely to become even more central in the public debate given the growing interest from charities, group communities and the public. In addition to academic beneficiaries, several potential beneficiaries from this research have been identified and agreed to participate in the project [see Pathways to Impact].

UK AND INTERNATIONAL POLICY MAKERS: Many family policies e.g. regarding parental leave are implicitly built on the notion that either the male-breadwinner or the equal-earner family models are in place and hence disregard the challenges faced by a non-negligible share of female-breadwinner families. Hence, acknowledging the emergence of female-breadwinner families will help to inform policy makers in shaping family and employment policies. About this project, COFACE, a confederation of 58 family organizations in 23 European countries, has said: &amp;quot;We believe that your research project will help policy makers and policy influencers, such is COFACE to have a much better understanding of the situation of families and help make better and more effective policies&amp;quot; [see letter of support].

THIRD SECTOR: Research on couples with women as main earners will help individual charities to better understand the changing dynamics of relationship, wellbeing, and risk of divorce for modern families. Potential beneficiaries of the research findings will be charities aimed at providing relationship support for couples such as Relate and OnePlusOne; offering support to men in crisis such as Calm (Campaign Against Living Miserably); helping working parents to achieve work-life balance such as Working Families; achieving women's equality and rights such as Fawcett Society.
About this project, Working Families has stated that: &amp;quot;We would like to understand more about the rise of female breadwinners. Through our work with employers we have begun to see a shift in some sectors towards a female breadwinner model, and would welcome the opportunity this research provides to gain a clearer picture of the resulting family, work and other dynamics&amp;quot; [see letter of support].

USERS COMMUNITIES: Examples of users' communities that will benefit from the project's findings include organizations and companies aimed at promoting gender equality and women's economic independence such as Women Budget Group and HEARST-Empowering Women, as well as those aimed at promoting conversations about manhood and masculinity such as Inside Man. 

PUBLIC: The project will influence the general public by increasing public awareness of the changing economic role of women in modern families, about how and why these families emerge, and what trends in female breadwinning mean for women, men and children. A website and content featured on social media platforms (Twitter and Facebook) will serve this purpose.

ADVISORY BOARD: Representatives from third sector organizations, think tanks, private companies, EU-funded organizations as well as a number of world-leading academics have committed to be part of the project's advisory board. The board will assure a two-way dialogue between academics and stakeholder since the onset of the project thereby ensuring that the outputs will be relevant to stakeholders, users and policy makers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152154</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute of Statistics (Istat)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Romina Fraboni</gtr:description><gtr:id>A73FDEC0-8C7E-422D-905A-0EF4CD7DB976</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Vitali, A. and Fraboni, R.

The audience was constituted of investors and portfolio managers. I have received many questions during the day, and requests for disseminating my presentation by email. The audience was particularly surprised to hear about the rising share of female breadwinners among the younger generations, and to think about what whether this will bring implications for the consumption profile of young couples today. I have received a request for a future collaboration for a similar event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c68ca47bf0a5.15371375</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant is ongoing. So far, the key findings suggested that, contrary to what previous research had hypothesised, the existence of female-breadwinner families seems to be associated with economic difficulties (male unemployment), rather than with gender equality. 
Related to this, the project demonstrated that female-breadwinner families are more widespread in countries and regions within countries characterized by high male unemployment (Southern and Eastern Europe, Ireland and Scotland). 
Additionally, preliminary analyses show that female-breadwinner families are poorer than male-breadwinner families and that women in female-breadwinner families tend to mainly be employed in manual occupations, whereas men in male-breadwinner families are also represented among managerial and professional occupations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I plan to extend the preliminary findings on the occupations of female breadwinners compared to women (and men) in other family types, across different ages, birth cohorts and countries. 
These results will hopefully be taken forward by other scholars who may re-think existing knowledge on e.g. the association between women's relative earnings and e.g. time spent on housework activities, risk of divorce, fertility. 
These results will help re-thinking the existing prejudice in the popular press and the media, which depict female breadwinners as high-educated, high-achieving women working in professional occupations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DD327E63-699D-4C07-88D8-486A2A3EA637</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58a755841864c1.27360746</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cpc.ac.uk/research_programme/?link=Female_Breadwinner_Families_in_Europe.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>814B25C8-7E54-4A5B-8750-A299E9591CD2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The educational gradient in matrimonial property regime among Italian and foreign spouses</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea48ea8c3856a8cff85fe9ee81f117a1"><gtr:id>ea48ea8c3856a8cff85fe9ee81f117a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vitali A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c692577a71b6.95179922</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>900CA7D8-834C-4DAB-BCC1-77A97B437F02</gtr:id><gtr:title>Women's economic dependency and the transition to marriage</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff27571c44980b387ab5d6807b74e59b"><gtr:id>ff27571c44980b387ab5d6807b74e59b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holland JA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c692a2ce7314.91321772</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>87D7FC52-6A0E-49F7-A869-90935EEF934F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Partners' relative incomes and fertility intentions</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea48ea8c3856a8cff85fe9ee81f117a1"><gtr:id>ea48ea8c3856a8cff85fe9ee81f117a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vitali A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c691ec148e58.89025268</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4D47C167-1C93-400A-A3A4-4A20DA84453E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Why pool resources in marriage?
