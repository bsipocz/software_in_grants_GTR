These site-based excavations have produced hundreds of hominid fossils representing Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and early Homo, yet any one early hominid species is well-represented from only one or two localities, limiting our understanding of morphological, environmental, and temporal variation of South African hominids. While a few new sites discovered in the past two decades have produced important (and sometimes spectacular) new hominid fossils, there has been no systematic, long-term research effort on a regional scale to locate new fossil sites. This field project will utilise historic mining records to produce a database of coordinate data locating potential palaeoanthropological sites in South Africa, and conduct field reconnaissance to survey and inventory historic mine/ fossil site localities in the field.

One factor in common to all South African early hominid fossil sites is that they correspond to the locations of historic lime mines that were in operation during the early 20th Century to produce calcium carbonate once required to smelt gold. The known mines (and related fossil sites) were prospected in the Malmani Dolomite Subgroup of the Transvaal Supergroup, which is an extensive sedimentary geological system that outcrops between Kimberley and Polokwane (a distance of approximately 800kms), but similar deposits exist in other parts of the country. Archival records of lime mine companies, and SA Geological Survey maps published in 1953 and 1959 document the location of several dozen limestone and dolomite mines throughout the country, and have been used to extract the coordinate data in order to locate these sites in the field and produce inventories of palaeontological resources such as fossils, datable deposits, and a variety of non-fossiliferous sampling materials (e.g., stable isotopes, palynology). Earlier archives and maps have not yet been incorporated into the database, and document additional mine sites with potential as fossil-bearing sites. 

This project will utilise GIS methods and handheld GPS equipment to conduct a widespread regional field survey and reconnaissance project. Site survey, inventory results and related site documentation will be incorporated into a GIS database, and analysed to prioritise site localities for future sampling, and possible excavation. The fieldwork will focus on location and inventory of sites, and sampling will take place in subsequent field seasons once SAHRA permits have been obtained. The database will be updated continuously, and form the basis for a web-based resource providing information about the project and about the history of South African palaeoanthropology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will be of value to a variety of non-academic communities, and will contribute to a deeper understanding of our palaeoanthropological heritage, and to the historical context of early palaeoanthropological research in Southern Africa. It will contribute to ongoing developments for South African heritage agencies, museums, schools, and tourism, all of which have been involved in and benefitted from palaeoanthropological research. Internationally, the topic of human evolution is of significant interest for museums, educational documentaries, school programmes, and public discussion. Currently in the UK and elsewhere, an ongoing debate about the role of scientific/ evolutionary versus religious viewpoints on human origins has gained attention from lobby groups and policymakers who develop public school curricular content. In addition, research indicates that public understanding of the scientific evidence regarding climate change and global warming is poor. Studies of environmental evolution can usefully contribute to this discourse, and all research in palaeoanthropology and related fields that illuminates our understanding of the scientific evidence for human evolution is relevant and important for raising public understanding and awareness, and for establishing a scientific basis for appropriate policy on such issues. This research project will contribute to raising public awareness of the significance of human evolution, and will elevate the public profile of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Sheffield as a major international centre for palaeoanthropology. 
This study will have the following impacts: 
1. Development of a project-dedicated web site to disseminate project results, and serve as an information hub about palaeoanthropology in South Africa and the historic and scientific context of this project. With future student involvement, and activities of a planned Field School in Palaeoanthropology, this will include field blogs and imagery of ongoing fieldwork, site details, and other educational information. The website will provide information relevant to student applicants, media researchers and scientific reporters, and the interested public; 
2. Development of public awareness in South Africa of palaeoanthropological heritage in the broad sense, through involvement with SAHRA, regional development and planning agencies, and other public and government organisations supporting World Heritage Site developments such as the Cradle of Humankind (Sterkfontein), and which monitor fieldwork projects and tourism development;
3. Opportunities for public engagement: 
a) Local museums such as the Arend Diepkirk Museum in Mokopane, and Polokwane Museum in the Limpopo Province, and the Origins Centre at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, maintain a strong interest in local heritage issues, and provide opportunities for public lectures, site tours and volunteer fieldwork (for example, see http://www.origins.org.za/whats_on/talks_at_origins/). During past fieldwork involvement at Makapansgat many such events were successfully arranged, and will remain part of this project's public engagement strategy. 
b) The Archaeology Department, University of Sheffield, sponsors a lecture series on departmental research for the university community and a public audience; and the Archaeological Society also sponsors a public lecture series. A departmental series of short courses in archaeology is offered for public and ongoing education communities, and plans for developments in palaeoanthropology are underway. Potential opportunities will be explored for involvement in other local (Sheffield) public lecture series, such as the Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique, sponsoring public talks by local researchers, and the Showroom Theatre Adventure Series, presenting short documentary films and other forms of media reaching a broad public community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91738</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We fulfilled our primary objective to utilise a GIS database documenting the provenance of historical/ disused limestone mines in South Africa to target new areas for survey and reconnaissance in pursuit of new Plio-Pleistocene palaeocave deposits and fossils. Our field work in three geographical/ geological regions located more than 20 new potential fossil and archaeological sites at old lime mines, natural sink holes (karst formations) and natural cave systems. This indicates that the prevalence and distribution of potential hominid fossil-bearing localities in the dolomite geology systems of South Africa are much more extensive than indicated by the distribution of known sites (i.e., restricted to the Cradle of Humankind). Future research to expand the areas of survey, and to revisit the site localities we located is needed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is my aim to continue this research and to pursue further field reconnaissance. We still intend to publish our GIS data set but prefer to re-visit the highly ranked localities we located and conduct the next phase of research involving site sampling and test excavation before providing details such as site provenance and other details on a publicly-accessible data base. However, the general knowledge that additional regional survey is highly likely to produce new fossil site localities will be useful as motivation to other researchers working, or planning work, in South Africa.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>75D90B71-8752-4227-BCB8-68596EDEE382</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e2d37a499852.30627523</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://southafricanpalaeocaves.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database will eventually be published or archived with the Archaeological Data Service (ADS) according to their standard guidelines and practice, as stipulated in the original grant proposal.
