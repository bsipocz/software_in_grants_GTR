The recent discovery that heavy water can reveal mechanical contrast and thus allow hydrodynamics to be directly visualised has yielded a novel method which will be an important correlative approach with which we can independently investigate epithelial hydrodynamics using this technologically-distinct and novel approach.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e05e95333c01.57166623-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Clark lab (SIOS) are experts in ultrasonic methods for non-destructive testing of materials. Together we have applied these methods at an unprecedentedly small scale, in order to target living biological cells. This involved the design and construction of a novel nanotransducer to launch ultrasonic waves under picosecond ultrasound interrogation, with the dual purpose of providing optical shielding from the exciting laser wavelengths which are injurious to living tissue. An entire bespoke microscope system has been created and implemented with phase contrast optics in order to perform correlative imaging with the novel method. Future work will focus on using picosecond ultrasound as a complementary method for revealing hydrodynamics to our main Raman microspectroscopy approach, which suffers certain crucial limitations in imaging at the required scales to probe dynamics across and between mammalian cells. This approach may result in a generalised method for contrast improvement or enhancement in cellular ultrasound imaging by manipulating density contrast within biomaterials - both living and fixed. As a dynamic method for assessing transmembrane or transcellular transport of fluid in living systems the method is under development, crossing engineering hurdles to make our imaging system compatible with life processes over extended periods.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have partnered with a collaborating group in Advanced Optics, led by Prof Matt Clark, and jointly developed a laser ultrasound instrument capable of revealing mechanical contrast from living biological cells at below the optical diffraction limit. Through a joint PhD supervision (Fernando Perez-Cota, viva passed in Feb 2016) we have demonstrated and applied this method to an array of biological cell types to reveal morphology and subcellular detail. We have recently extended this approach into dynamic imaging of hydrodynamics by exploiting the availability of innocuous heavy isotopes of water (D2O) in order to reveal fluid fluxes into and across cells by monitoring changes in their accoustic properties in the presence of these denser solutions.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kode Biotech Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>New Zealand</gtr:country><gtr:description>Novel surface chemistries for polarisation of epithelial tissues on arbitrary surfaces</gtr:description><gtr:id>C1AA787F-7461-4BE2-9712-647F264CD18E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A pair of manuscripts are under preparation.

We have further advised the US group on approaches to live cell imaging and maintenance in vitro which has led to a step-change in operational workflow in the Nanomembranens Research Group (NRG) at Rochester.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Inaugural Symposium and Workshop - Epithelial Microdevices</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F325B120-8AE4-412D-BF29-60C20462AAB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>an inaugural 3-day Symposium and workshop was held at the University of Rochester, NY on the theme of &amp;quot;Epithelial Microdevices&amp;quot;.

Nottingham participants included members of the Webb lab as well as TTO representatives and collaborators on epithelial transport and physiology, and industrial collaborators from SimPore Inc, Rochester NY and Kode Biotech Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand. 
In addition to our inaugural workshop and symposium, which we are planning to repeat in Nottingham UK during summer 2017, we have instituted the third in our researcher exchance program between Rochester and Nottingham with a 9-month hosted visit of Mr Greg Madejski to Nottingham through August 2016. Mr Madejski has developed himself into a potent weilder of nanofabrication techniques to develop novel nanomaterials for cell culture and biosensing, resulting in the creation of a series of nanoporous and microporous substrates for cell culture and biosensors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A11A8EC4-A9D8-461D-8623-553AC9A56977</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56e0670a5d49a7.47682097</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A novel nanoporous membrane and method of fabrication is taught, which confers an extremely sensitive surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based sensing substrate capable of large enhancements of Raman signatures of analytes bound to its surface. The material has the ability to perform flow-through sensing and is erasible using standard electrochemistry by virtue of its electrical contiguity. The material is fabricated using silicon wafer processing, lending itself to scalable and reproducible manufacture and solving a major barrier to the high-throughput fabrication of SERS sensors in the field.

In the future these novel devices may subsitute for animal work, provide platforms for novel biosensing and bioimaging assys, personalised medicine, and novel miniaturised devices for the study and manipulation of living systems using non-invasive photonic means.
This consortium had its inaugural meeting in August 2016 in Rochester, NY and has so far shared team members internationally on 3 separate research visits and placements between Rochester and Nottingham. 
In addition, several serendipitous discoveries have been opened up to exploitation within the consortium, including novel surface chemistries, nanomaterials, and photoniclally-manipulable cell lines capable of modulating physiology non-invasively by optical means.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our consortium is working to create the physical underpinnings for novel epithelial microdevices - embodying robust epithelial tissue barriers in vitro with the aim of replacing animal work with robust, reproducible assays for tissue physiology, barrier function, drug delivery, and toxicity. Physiological parameters can be adjusted and manipulated noninvasively using light, while reading out via electrical, electrochemical, biosensing (SERS) and non-invasive Raman microspectroscopy.
In addition to mammalian and human physiology and pharmacology our non-invasive imaging methods have found application in the real-time study of water uptake and transport by living plants.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3366B2CA-DB7E-4068-A340-456B7C63E8BD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0671aabd7b4.91200872</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>48850011-9890-4012-9050-B63F18FD5D19</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic functional contribution of the water channel AQP5 to the water permeability of peripheral lens fiber cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of physiology.
