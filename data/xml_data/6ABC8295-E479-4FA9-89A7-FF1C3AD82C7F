This parasite causes sleeping sickness, killing thousands of people each year. We hope our research will lead to better sleeping sickness treatments being developed. 
The African trypanosome is a single celled organism. It lives and multiplies in the blood and is spread by the tsetse fly. Sleeping sickness is always fatal unless treated. Current treatments have serious side effects and are not always effective. 
Trypanosomes multiply by doubling the contents of their cell and then dividing them in two. If we can prevent them dividing, trypanosomes won?t be able to multiply in the body and cause disease. We predict that many cell division proteins will be essential for trypanosome survival in the human body. We are using information from the published trypanosome genome sequence combined with a technique called RNA interference to identify such proteins. Trypanosomes also divide differently compared to human cells, so it?s likely that the proteins that control this process will be different too. This is important as it suggests that drugs could be developed in the future to target trypanosome cell division proteins without affecting human proteins, reducing the likelihood of side effects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The protozoon parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, is spread by the tsetse fly and causes sleeping sickness in humans in sub-Saharan Africa, which is fatal if left untreated. No vaccine exists and current chemotherapy is far from ideal due to toxicity and the emergence of drug resistant parasites. T. brucei displays a complex life cycle alternating between insect and mammalian hosts and characterised by a series of differentiation steps to distinct forms. To multiply and establish infection in each host, the parasite must, periodically, accurately replicate and segregate its organelles. Cell division occurs via binary fission (rather than through constriction of an actomyosin ring as in other eukaryotes), with the cleavage furrow ingressing from the anterior end to bisect the cell. Although cell division has been investigated at the level of the cytoskeleton and organelles, little is known about the molecules that control and effect cytokinesis. RNA interference (RNAi) has demonstrated that trypanosome MOB1 (which interacts with the protein kinase PK50) and TRACK (Trypanosome Receptor Activated C Kinase) are required for cytokinesis, and trypanosome homologues of other eukaryotic cytokinesis regulators have been identified. Further, RNAi of MOB1 has different effects in the mammalian bloodstream and insect procyclic life cycle stages, suggesting differential regulation of cytokinesis. It is hypothesised that cytokinesis in T. brucei will be regulated by signal transduction pathways and effected by protein complexes that localise to the cleavage furrow during division. Further, because of observed differences in cell division compared to other organisms, it is proposed that T. brucei has evolved novel control mechanisms, which could be exploited to design new anti-parasitic therapies. To test these hypotheses, RNAi in combination with DAPI staining and flow cytometry will be used to investigate the function of candidate cytokinesis regulators and to screen for novel parasite-specific cell cleavage proteins in T. brucei. Protein function will be analysed in bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes using fluorescence and electron microscopy to identify stage specific differences in cytokinesis. Interactions between cytokinesis proteins will be investigated using immune precipitation and co-localisation techniques, and the constituents of protein complexes probed using proteomic approaches to identify novel proteins. Substrates of regulatory protein kinases selected from functional studies will be identified through a phage display screening method, as well as in vitro kinase assays. This work will provide insights into the unique cell biology of T. brucei and will contribute to its development as a model organism for the parasitic protozoa.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>355183</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A scanning electron microscope image of a dividing trypanosome, representing my research was displayed on the Glasgow Clyde walkway outside the Glasgow Science Centre, with accompanying text and podcast, as part of the Images of Science Exhibition, 2011.

Both carried out research projects in my lab, cloning trypanosome genes for cytokinesis regulators into vectors that would allow the expression and purification of recombinant protein from bacteria. Both students really enjoyed the opportunity to experience life in the lab and to try their hand at molecular biology. One student received a CREST Gold award for her work and was invited to participate in the BA Science Fair in London.

The 2007 student produced excellent results, and we have submitted a manuscript to J. Biol. Chem. for publication that describes the recombinant proteins she produced during her time in the lab. She was awarded a place at the BA Science Fair in London, where she got to present a poster (acknowledging MRC support for the project) of her results to members of the public and other school pupils and parents, and received publicity for her success in local papers.
