The results indicate there is a significant direct source of anthropogenic formic acid HCOOH emitted from vehicles. The study suggests that vehicle emissions can be responsible for up to 30% of HCOOH in the urban environment.

This study has given a better understanding of why there is such a variance in the modelled and observed concentrations of formic acid. It can be inferred that the importance of direct emissions of formic acid from vehicles emissions is significantly under-represented in global models. 
Its inclusion in global models reduces the gap between the observed and predicted concentrations of formic acid, especially in the northern hemisphere where vehicle use and anthropogenic activity is at its highest.

Measurements of formic acid in winter in London were shown to arise from vehicular combustion, through comparison with NOx and CO combustion markers. In addition, the very low surface ozone levels preclude the ozonolysis of alkenes as a source of formic acid. Formic acid emission factors with respect to NOx have been derived and used in a global model integration. This integration shows that although ozonolysis of 1-alkenes is the dominant source, direct vehicle emissions can be up to 30% of the emission in mid-high latitudes in the northern hemisphere.

Data sets were provided to the modelling partners to assess secondary organic aerosol emissions from missing diesel-related sources. Modelled concentrations were evaluated against hourly and daily measurements of organic aerosol (OA) components derived from the Manchester aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements made during the ClearfLo campaign. According to the model simulations, diesel-related IVOCs could explain on average only ~ 30 % of the annual Secondary OA (SOA) in and around London. Furthermore, the 90th percentile of modelled daily SOA concentrations for the whole year was 3.8 &amp;micro;g m-3, constituting a notable addition to total particulate matter. More measurements of these precursors (currently not included in official emissions inventories) was recommended. During the period of concurrent measurements, SOA concentrations at rural background locations east of London were greater than at the central London location. The model study showed that this was caused by an intense pollution plume with a strong gradient of imported SOA passing over the rural location. This demonstrated the value of combined modelling and monitoring of OA for important short duration events.

The first intensive study of the size distribution, mixing state and source apportionment of black carbon aerosol in London during wintertime was made. An important output of this work was demonstration of a novel methodology to attribute the black carbon aerosol number concentrations and mass abundances from traffic ( and from solid fuel burning thus updating missing elements of current emission inventories.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>New methods for identification of different black carbon and SOA aerosol sources were developed and are providing important new insigths and updates to current pollution emission inventories for regulatory, policy adherence and mitigation strategy.

Formic acid emission factors with respect to NOx were derived and used in global model integrations. This shows that although ozonolysis of 1-alkenes is the dominant source, direct vehicle emissions can contrinute up to 30% of the emission in mid-high latitudes in the northern hemisphere.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F41BA5BB-452A-489E-A3E3-BD8BB0BFE6E5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54453a02b1f169.47059042</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Construction,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.clearflo.ac.uk/outreach/papers/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Data from the ClearfLo (Clean Air for London) Project.
