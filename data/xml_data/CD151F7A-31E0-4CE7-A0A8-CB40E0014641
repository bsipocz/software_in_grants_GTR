Potential sources of land-based renewable energy include bioenergy from forests, arable crops, energy crops and waste, solar heating and electricity, hydroelectricity, ground-source heat, and wind-energy. The spatial organisation of such energy sources, together with energy demand, energy infrastructure and other energy-sources within a particular landscape can be termed the 'EnergyScape'. 'Ecosystem Services' is a collective term to describe the various services we obtain from land and its associated ecosystems. They include the provision of food, fibre and fuel, the regulation of nutrients, water supply and water quality, the creation of opportunities for recreation and education, the maintenance of biodiversity, and the space to build and maintain our supporting infrastructure. The development and use of land-based renewable energy resources will have both negative and positive impacts on these services. Positive aspects may include increased biodiversity from biomass crops; negative aspects may include reduced river flows and increased road transport of biomass. This one-year research project aims to determine, through a pilot study, how a systematic understanding of the 'EnergyScape' and 'Ecosystem Services' could help guide the deployment of land-based renewables. For the pilot study we have selected Marston Vale in Bedfordshire which is a sub-catchment of the Great Ouse river, and contains a mix of agricultural, forestry and urban land. It is the site of a community forest and there is local interest in renewable energy. Working with national and local stakeholder groups, the project will identify the key sources of renewable energy within the study area and the key ecosystem services likely to be affected by the development of land-based renewables. Using spatial data, geographical information systems and existing models, the project will then develop a spatial description of the EnergyScape and the key ecosystem services for the study area. Because some models are weaker than others, we will use a 'Plug and Play' framework, as used in computing, so that new and improved models can be introduced as they become available. Similarly, the approach will allow new data sources to be included as they become available. Starting from the base-line description, we will then investigate the benefits and losses associated with the deployment of different combinations of land based renewables. Because renewable energy sources have different spatial and temporal characteristics relative to the demand for energy, the outputs will not be simply additive. Similarly, there will be complex interactions between energy generation and different ecosystem services, and amongst the ecosystem services. Some interactions will be antagonistic (e.g. solar power v demand for heating; food v biofuel) whereas others may be complementary (e.g. sharing of facilities; biofuel v biodiversity). By using appropriate visualisation tools, we hope that the key interactions can be explained to stakeholder groups, who can then use the information to inform future decisions. We intend that the approach developed in this research, which will be limited to the renewables and ecosystems of a specific area, can be applied to other regions and at a national spatial scale in future research projects. To validate the academic efficacy of our approach, we will submit papers for peer review, seeking to get them published in high-impact scientific journals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96537</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In High Education, we have used the Energyscapes and Ecosystem Services Framework, as used in Marston Vale, as a workshop exercise for 50-80 MSc students at Cranfield University each year to teach about the interactions between energy, the environment, and the agrifood sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7AD8132A-0DC9-4089-85FC-789C7806304B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5453ccbc04aed7.86383585</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>High fuel prices and concerns about energy security and anthropogenic climate change are encouraging transition towards a low carbon economy. Although energy policy is typically set at a national level, tools are needed for people to engage with energy policy at regional and local levels. Tools are also needed to describe the interactions between renewable energy options and the other goods and services provided by a landscape.

The overall aim was to determine, through a pilot study, how an understanding of ecosystem services and the &amp;quot;energyscape&amp;quot; could help guide the deployment of land-based renewables. One definition of an energyscape is: &amp;quot;the spatial and temporal combinations of energy supply, demand and infrastructure within a landscape&amp;quot;. 

The project used a whole system approach to address four objectives:
1.To extend the ecosystem approach to the development of land-based renewables
2.To develop methods to describe an energyscape in terms of interacting resources and conflicting demands
3.To develop and demonstrate an integrated model linking an energyscape with models of key ecosystem services for a case study site
4.To identify how and where to deploy different land-based renewables in relation to specified objectives, and to recommend how the approach should be applied to other sites and situations.

Case study area: Marston Vale, a 160 km2 sub-catchment of the Great Ouse bordering Bedford and Milton Keynes, was chosen as the case study area. The predominant land use is arable agriculture. Brick manufacture has led to the excavation of clay pits, which have been flooded or used for landfill. Taking into account currently consented housing, the population density (3.1 persons/ha) is between that for England (3.9 persons/ha) and the UK (2.5 persons/ha).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>?Energy production and distribution is an important ecosystem service not captured in current ecosystem service classifications. In the UK, the demand for energy (on a per capita basis) is six-times greater than the combined embedded energy of food, feed and wood. Hence an ecosystem service approach to land planning that excludes energy is flawed
?The developed models can allow stakeholders to visualise the key effects of different forms of renewable energy production on food, feed, and wood production, farmland bird numbers, soil carbon, and recreational opportunity
?Further research is needed to evaluate the method at other locations and at different scales, and the economics and the net greenhouse gas balance of the various options.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DC5E1E97-94D4-48C5-92AD-D97183A112F6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5453cc096a8ff7.81773517</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D6C8B119-4129-4C59-8C31-17C22E9DFC60</gtr:id><gtr:title>Predicting the impacts of bioenergy production on farmland birds.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Science of the total environment</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aa28279b100f555025a1b3721b27f7df"><gtr:id>aa28279b100f555025a1b3721b27f7df</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rivas Casado M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0048-9697</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d00a00a084405b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF76719B-26DF-4E33-AE70-37301F6F52CB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Energyscapes: Linking the energy system and ecosystem services in real landscapes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biomass and Bioenergy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cb779d0da2d79b1fd90c7942efffe5d9"><gtr:id>cb779d0da2d79b1fd90c7942efffe5d9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Howard D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe6fe6c8e2990</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>81750365-8842-4D70-8B0E-81A3F1ECA48E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Environmental Impact Assessment, ecosystems services and the case of energy crops in England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Environmental Planning and Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bca92e17015df16f831433132e374977"><gtr:id>bca92e17015df16f831433132e374977</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coleby A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03d03d3f247b3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>102D66B0-F020-46DB-B82B-6DEB5AA810DD</gtr:id><gtr:title>A framework for reviewing the trade-offs between, renewable energy, food, feed and wood production at a local level</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e61b0252c761fa0da9c52d6f0f830d00"><gtr:id>e61b0252c761fa0da9c52d6f0f830d00</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Burgess P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0090092b5fc57</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/H010424/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12C7A68B-3922-4925-9C0B-7FACEC921815</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecosystem Scale Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
