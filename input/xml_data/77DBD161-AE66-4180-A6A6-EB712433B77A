Despite recent technological improvements in this field, state-of-the-art glazing systems fail to make efficient use of materials, have a low robustness, a relatively high thermal conductivity, and are rarely recycled.
Recent research developments in glass engineering, adhesive bonding and fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites provide an opportunity to explore a novel combination of these materials in the form of FRP-glass composite structures. These consist of glass plates that are bonded to pultruded FRP profiles by means of high strength - high stiffness thermosetting adhesives, thereby forming an FRP-glass composite panel . This is a novel, yet relatively simple concept, but it involves a radical shift in the role of glass in buildings: from its current use as an inefficient infill panel in a layered system, to a structurally and thermally efficient component within a robust and recyclable composite structure.
The aim of this 24 month project is two-fold: Firstly to characterise the thermo-mechanical properties and environmental impact of a first generation, yet novel, form of composite FRP-glass panel; and secondly to explore the feasibility of more adventurous second generation composite glass panels. The latter offer further improvements over the basic FRP-glass panels, in terms of structural performance, adaptability and recyclability. This aim will be achieved by means of coordinated thermo-mechanical investigations involving physical experiments, numerical modelling and theoretical analyses at three levels: (1) material level, (2) FRP-glass connection level; and (3) full-scale composite glass panel level, 
The evaluation of the potential benefits of composite glass panels and the fundamental properties characterised in this project will: (1) provide a basis for future research and product development in this new sub-field; (2) help produce novel glazed building envelopes that significantly out-perform existing state-of the-art glazing systems; (3) lead to step-change improvements in the sustainability and resilience of new and existing buildings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project proposes a novel combination of FRP and glass which if successful, would ultimately lead to step-change improvements in the sustainability and resilience of existing and future buildings. The impacts in the built environment will be technological (novel form FRP-glass components), societal (resilient and more efficient buildings), economical (cheaper and thinner building envelopes) and environmental (thermal performance of buildings, minimise materials usage, recyclability). This research will also have impacts in sectors where glass is used in conjunction with other materials (e.g. automotive and consumer products).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239570</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arup Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with engineering consultant: Arup</gtr:description><gtr:id>37776588-6560-46C7-B633-DFC67BD46D96</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Arup are supporting the new proposal the new FRP-Glass proposal.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8134ec798b6.99370017-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Knowledge and expertise on real-world facade engineering</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing test data on FRP-glass composites</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Biosciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Prof Nick Warrior and Dr Lee Harper at the Composites Research Group at the University of Nottingham on novel methods of manufacture for FRP components in the FRP-Glass composite structures.
