trend towards warmer winters has adversely affected dormancy break and subsequent crop yields and quality, substantially reducing profitability. The use of existing dormancy-breaking treatments, developed for stone fruit crops, will be assessed for their efficacy in blackcurrant, their use optimised, and their mode of action evaluated at a physiological/biochemical level. From this, a new improved product for blackcurrant and 'best practice' guidelines for growers can be developed. Additionally, models predicting responses to the chilling environment for different varieties will be established, and this information will be used to direct the use of dormancy-breaking treatments to improve yield and quality. The project outcomes will directly influence future blackcurrant production in the UK, and will also be applicable to other perennial fruit crops, many of which have high chill requirements and are most productive after cold winters.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project addresses the effects of climate change in the UK on blackcurrant production, where the trend towards warmer winters has adversely affected dormancy break and subsequent crop yields and quality, substantially reducing profitability.

It will contribute most importantly to the improved and sustainable production of
blackcurrants in the UK, within the context of a changing climate. The development of a new dormancy-breaking treatment has very large potential impact across a range of woody crop species, and will also generate considerable income for the various downstream industries. On a more fundamental basis, the project will deliver considerable knowledge of the mechanisms by which woody crop plants respond to temperature, and how these can be amended in various climate
scenarios. This will be used to inform future blackcurrant breeding strategies, which in turn can provide a model for other crop improvement programmes. The impact on the public will be through the continued availability and diversification of
processed blackcurrant products, based on UK production. The overall impact of the project should demonstrate the effectiveness of the multidisciplinary approach of the work and the project team, leading to a successful translation of scientific developments to industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>230771</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Agricultural and Horticulture Development Board</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Winter chilling in blackcurrants: adapting to climate change, through new technologies for improved dormancy release</gtr:description><gtr:id>576D5A1C-2799-4436-B241-53AD39B923E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Owing to the confidential nature of this project, outcomes of this project have not yet been made public</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc89493d1028.43032969-8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>LUCOZADE RIBENA SUNTORY (LTD) incorporates two of the UK's biggest soft drinks brands, and is the third largest branded soft drinks supplier in the UK market.
