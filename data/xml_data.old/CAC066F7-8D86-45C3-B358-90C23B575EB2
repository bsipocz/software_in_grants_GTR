To develop the most effective prevention and treatment programmes for fears acquired in this way it is necessary to understand the mechanisms underpinning learning. This is the first aim of the research programme.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Researchers have shown that anxiety is associated with increased heart rate and maintained by biased ways of looking and thinking; in particular, anxious individuals tend to notice and pay more attention to their feared object. However, it is not yet known how or why these attentional biases develop. A further aim is to investigate whether vicarious learning can affect heart rate and the amount of attention paid to an object.&lt;br />&lt;br />The third aim is to evaluate ways of preventing and treating the negative outcomes of vicarious learning. The project will examine whether vicariously learnt fear responses to animals can be reversed by training people to divert their attention away from them.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, the research will also investigate whether vicarious learning can also be used to protect against acquiring fears and eliminate existing fears. This work will be of particular interesting to psychologists, teachers and parents.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?

The proposed research programme has three main aims, to determine: 1) the mechanisms underlying children's vicarious learning of fear; 2) how these fears and their associated physiological responses and cognitive biases develop; and 3) whether children's vicariously acquired fears and associated responses can be prevented and/or reversed. Thus the main non-academic befeficiaries of the research will be children and their families, teachers and other individuals who work with children, mental health practitioners treating children, and policy makers involved in mental health, social welfare and education. 

How will they benefit?

End Users:

An important aim of the program is to directly test ways of preventing fears from developing and this will impact positively on children's lives. Findings will inform parents, teachers and others who work with children about potential situations where fears can develop and how to avoid them. The research will also indicate how parents and carers can intervene to reduce the chances of a fear developing if a child does observe someone else's fear or phobia. In addition, research findings will impact on children's and parent's lives by informing mental health practitioners about how fears and phobias are acquired vicariously and how the resulting fear-related responses can be reversed. 

Mental Health Professionals: 

By understanding the causes, development and mechanisms of vicarious fear learning in children we can develop better ways to prevent children developing fears. The research also directly tests ways of preventing and reversing vicariously learnt fear responses. Attentional training is for example a very current and innovative method of treating anxiety that is directly investigated in relation to vicarious fear learning in children. Thus the research outputs will have positive impact on mental health service practitioners in terms of improving understanding and treating children's fears. 

Policy makers:

The aims of the research programme are in line with the aims of current government advisory reports stating the importance of minimising risk factors involved in the development of child mental illness (e.g. Department for Children Schools and Families, 2010; Department of Health, 2010; Jenkins et al., 2008). In addition to obvious emotional and psychological benefits, preventing children developing fear and anxiety has clear economic benefits. Mental illness is extremely costly (Jenkins et al., 2008). Some estimates put the cost to England's economy as high as &amp;pound;77 billion when the wider impacts of mental illness are taken into account (Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 2003). Anxiety and depression alone lead to an estimated &amp;pound;12 billion per year in loss of output for the UK (Bell et al., 2006). There are currently no figures specifically for the economic impact of childhood anxiety; however, in 2002/03 the overall cost of child mental illness in England was estimated to be around &amp;pound;4.5 billion (Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 2003). Childhood anxiety is also associated with problems later in life such as anxiety in adulthood (Kim-Cohen, et al., 2003; Weems, 2008), depression (Kovacs et al., 1989) and substance misuse (Kushner et al., 1990). The Layard Report recently outlined economic savings that could be made by treating mental illness in adults (Bell et al., 2006). Consequently, benefits and savings would also be expected by preventing and treating fear and anxiety already occurring in childhood.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>261618</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference: Effects of vicarious learning on childhood fear acquisition and fear reversal (symposium), BPS Developmental Section Annual Conference (Amsterdam, Netherlands)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B82DF621-DE21-40CB-A64A-AE90E3A0EE9F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation was well attended by researchers and other professionals, and stimulated questions and discussions based on the research.

Research grant findings have also been reported to non-academic audiences in BBC Focus magazine ('Science Focus'): http://tinyurl.com/nnwcqsk and Kingston magazine: http://reader.livedition.dk/kingstonreview/11/23 as well as in 'Society Now: ESRC Research Making an Impact': http://www.esrc.ac.uk/files/news-events-and-publications/publications/magazines-and-newsletters/society-now/society-now-issue-25/a and a website created specifically for the project: https://sites.google.com/site/cicaresearchlab/ 

Other impact of the research at this stage includes a series of computer programs that are being used for further research. The success of the project also led the School of Social Science at Kingston University to fund a three-year PhD studentship to continue research in this area, which started March 2016 and is now located at the University of Surrey (where the PI is now located).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7DC5C6BB-AA49-475B-962F-A928B3306D89</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5454b4b50ebc72.57074571</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) Mechanisms underpinning vicarious fear learning in childhood:
 
Establishing learning mechanisms was critical for understanding how fears and phobias are vicariously learnt in childhood. Five experiments investigated properties of the conditioned stimulus (CS; Australian marsupials) and unconditioned stimulus (US; the emotional response of a model) in vicarious learning. *Experiment 1 established that vicarious fear learning: (i) is underpinned by CS-US associations, and (ii) can be reversed if the model's response (US) is subsequently devalued ('US devaluation'). This was achieved by indicating to the child that the model was not as scared as they appeared to be and may be a useful early intervention to reduce fear. Findings were published in the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology (Reynolds, Field &amp;amp; Askew, 2015). 
 Experiment 11 found that children show similar increases in fear responses for snakes compared to the marsupials, suggesting that the 'fear-relevance' of a stimulus (CS) does not influence vicarious fear learning in 6 to 9-year-olds. Results were published in the journal: Emotion (Askew, Dunne, &amp;Ouml;zdil, Reynolds, &amp;amp; Field, 2013). Some pre-existing experimental data examining the effects of manipulating models' responses (US) were also re-analysed and written-up, indicating that seeing animals with models expressing disgust leads to increases in children's disgust, fear and avoidance for animals. These findings were published in Journal of Abnormal Psychology (Askew, Cakir, Poldsam, &amp;amp; Reynolds, 2014). 
 In Experiments 2 and 10, children's vicariously learnt fear-related responses for one stimulus were also found for a second stimulus that was seen with the first but never together with a fearful model (second-order learning). This may explain why some individuals cannot recall a negative learning experience with their feared stimulus and suggests that possible associations with other stimuli should be investigated during treatment. These findings are to be published in the journal Cognition and Emotion (Reynolds, Field &amp;amp; Askew, in press). Finally, an 'occasion setting' procedure in Experiment 3 found no evidence that the learning context is influential in vicarious learning. 


2) Vicarious learning of threat-related attentional biases and physiological responses:

Experiment 4 used video modelling and did not find unequivocal changes in heart rate due to vicarious learning. However, using the picture-picture paradigm, Experiment 5 established that children show increased fear beliefs, avoidance preferences and attentional bias for animals seen with fearful models, and these remained elevated for at least one month. Results also indicated that children take longer to approach these animals and show increases in heart rate when they do. Findings were published in Emotion (Reynolds, Field &amp;amp; Askew, 2014). 


3) Prevention and reversal of children's vicariously acquired fear responses: 

Three experiments successfully identified interventions by which vicarious fear learning in children could be prevented or reversed. Experiment 7 found that fear responses for a stimulus do not increase if children are given neutral ('latent inhibition') or positive modelling ('immunisation') experiences with the stimulus before vicarious learning. These results were published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology (Askew, Reynolds, Fielding-Smith &amp;amp; Field, 2016). Experiment 9 established that vicariously learnt avoidance preferences, heart rate responses and attentional bias can be unlearnt using positive modelling after learning ('vicarious counterconditioning'). The findings will be published in the Journal of Clinical Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychology (Reynolds, Field &amp;amp; Askew, in press). Experiment 12 investigated the effectiveness of post-learning positive modelling and positive verbal information and found evidence that both reversed vicariously learnt fear responses. Experiment 6 found no evidence that attentional bias modification would successfully reduce fear responses following vicarious learning. 

*Note: Experiment numbering from the original Case for Support has been used, with the addition of three originally unplanned experiments: 10, 11 and 12. Planned Experiment 8 was not conducted because findings from Experiment 3 made it redundant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project manipulated a paradigm that models the way fears are acquired in childhood. One strength of the work has been that both theory and clinical intervention have been investigated, with the results for one having implications for the other. This integrated approach has opened-up experimentally-based clinical research pathways that other researchers can follow-up on. There is also an expectation that findings could influence the development of future interventions. To this end, the PI and RF have been disseminating results at national and international conferences attended by leading clinicians, developmental psychologists and researchers studying psychopathology. Findings have also been submitted to international peer-review journals read by academics and clinicians interested in the development of fears, and preventing and treating childhood anxiety disorders. Six articles from grant-supported work have already been published in high-impact journals and two more are currently in press. 

Findings will also be carried forward by a new PhD student. Due its success, on completion of the research project the School of Social Science at Kingston University agreed to fund a PhD studentship to continue the research. The PI and PhD student have now moved institutions and are based at the University of Surrey. Finally, the RF (now a senior lecturer at Middlesex University) is continuing the work and has submitted several funding proposals in combination with other researchers, including the PI, to investigate vicarious learning and childhood sleep quality.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7CFD5EDD-1863-40AB-844E-53ADD66223E9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>556492ebb21438.90786473</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/cicaresearchlab/home/research/current-projects</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5BBFF751-F413-4A39-8B18-92AC4F1AFC63</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inhibition of vicariously learned fear in children using positive modeling and prior exposure.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of abnormal psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4188e3718cfe69bc4ce467aecddd5f7d"><gtr:id>4188e3718cfe69bc4ce467aecddd5f7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Askew C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-843X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56cefde80f7051.81617988</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6A195AFB-83BF-49E8-9F1A-7FA10EE05BFD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Preventing the Development of Observationally Learnt Fears in Children by Devaluing the Model's Negative Response.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of abnormal child psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/34169851966e41a0a3b48dfb9f464f07"><gtr:id>34169851966e41a0a3b48dfb9f464f07</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Reynolds G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0091-0627</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5564942e51da69.52341423</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>25BBA2A8-1B87-47E3-BDFE-761449362673</gtr:id><gtr:title>Learning to fear a second-order stimulus following vicarious learning.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognition &amp;
