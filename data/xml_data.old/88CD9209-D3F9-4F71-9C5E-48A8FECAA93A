patients with a longer period of measured cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) maintained within the
calculated optimal CPP (CPPopt) ranges have (1) an improved outcome, and (2) better tolerance
against raised intracranial pressure (ICP).
WORK PLAN: We set up a new multi-centre, multi-disciplinary and multi-national clinical and research
collaborative called KidsBrainIT. In a 2-year prospective observational study, 10 centres contribute
paediatric TBI patients' annoymised clinical, high-resolution physiological, and outcome data to a central
repository (KidsBrainIT Data-bank). Using the same methodology as our pilot (optimal CPP calculation
and ICP dose-response plots), the main data-set is used to test our hypotheses. A sub-set of data is
used to test novel technology and data models. Calculated validated indices is used as metrics of
clinical management quality assurance for feedback to contributing units to improve treatment.
EXPLOITATION OF RESULTS: By bringing senior clinicians, engineers, and scientists from different
centres and countries to the group, KidsBrainIT facilitates testing of clinically relevant therapeutic
thresholds and validating new monitoring technologies which are then readily translated back into
clinical practice through contributing units. It will also address inequality and variations in TBI
management between adult and paediatric practices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims: We aim to set up a new multi-centre, multi-disciplinary, multi-national intensive care informatics group for paediatric brain trauma (KidsBrainIT) for current and future hypotheses testing. We then aim to use the KidsBrainIT data-set in this proposal to test two clinically relevant hypotheses: After sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI), paediatric patients with a longer period of measured cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) maintained within the calculated optimal CPP (CPPopt) window have (1) an improved global clinical outcome, and (2) better tolerance against raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Methods: A 2-year prospective observational study is planned in the current proposal. Paediatric TBI patients requiring intensive care will be recruited from 10 contributing centres in 4 different countries. We will collect their anonymised routinely collected bedside physiological monitoring data in minute resolutions linked with anonymised clinical and outcome data and store it to the central KidsBrainIT data-bank. CPPopt is calculated using the LAx-CPP plots and DATACAR methodology and ICP dose response analyses will be performed on the KidsBrainIT dataset. These will be correlated with global outcome at 6 months. Age-maturation effects are studied by grouping patients into three previously described age-bands. In addition, a centralised informatics based quality assurance infrastructure is in place to generate treatment compliance reports to our contributing units for clinical care and patient safety improvement.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential Health and Clinical Impact: While the current proposal (Phase-1 of KidsBrainIT) will address inequality and variations in TBI management between adult and paediatric practices, the ultimate objective of KidsBrainIT is to improve paediatric TBI intensive care management in the UK, Europe, North America and beyond. To achieve this ultimate objective, we plan to expand in later phases of KidsBrainIT to include other centres beyond the current consortium in this proposal. Currently we have another 6 UK, 1 European, 1 US, and 1 Canadian centres waiting to join Phase-2 of the KidsBrainIT initiative.
We expect our contributing units to benefit from quality improvement (QI) summary reports by allowing each unit to quality improve and adjust local clinical management, education and feedback to frontline staff thereby improving patient care standards, safety and outcome. While initially the impact on patient care and safety are delivered in 6 monthly cycles to the contributing units, KidsBrainIT will ultimately produce per-patient QI reports to contributing units so that each centre can obtain feedback on how well their own team is with adhering to target treatments and achieving the calculated CPPopt.
With KidsBrainIT's planned expansion to include other units in the world and IT innovation development to allow real-time monitoring systems with live management feedback in the future (see: www.chartadapt.org), we expect KidsBrainIT will ultimately benefit paediatric TBI care worldwide. Through continual collaboration with adult BrainIT, we will reduce inequality between adult and paediatric TBI management and research. We expect to generate validated ICP dose-response graphs for three clinically relevant age-bands by the end of the study. These graphs are readily translated back to clinical practice to allow a more refined evidence based management of raised ICP. We expect our contributing units to adopt these graphs in their clinical practice soon after the end of this study and through publication at peer reviewed journal and conference presentations, we anticipate uptake by other clinical units within 5 years of this study especially when translation of our findings into clinical practice does not require any additional equipment or software to those already used for routine clinical bedside monitoring. KidsBrainIT is conducting non-commercial research to improve paediatric TBI care, safety and outcome. If technologies or equipment developed by our contributing partners are proven to be useful in advancing care and outcome, we will encourage them to seek patent recognition and opportunities to commercialise its use so that a wider clinical community may benefit from our research. Adult BrainIT has experience in such practice with Prof. Ragauskus (an adult BrainIT steering group member from Lithuania) having a track record in successfully commercialising novel monitoring technologies such as non-invasive ICP and cerebro-autoregulation monitoring in adults.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195566</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DB62D233-D85A-46AB-AC63-BEC925B501EB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Visualizing Cerebrovascular Autoregulation Insults and Their Association with Outcome in Adult and Paediatric Traumatic Brain Injury.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta neurochirurgica.
