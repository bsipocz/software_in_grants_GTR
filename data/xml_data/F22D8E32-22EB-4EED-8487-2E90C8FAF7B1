The adventitious leakage of buildings has received particular attention as standards in the UK have for many years been relatively poor. Most new buildings now have to show satisfactory levels of airtightness to comply with the Regulations. The airtightness of a building envelope is allied directly to the efficiency of the space conditioning, which is typically the main energy use. Therefore, reducing adventitious leakage can make a significant reduction in energy consumption. The method used presently to ascertain compliance with the Regulations is called the steady pressurisation technique. This technique has been used globally for many years, but does have a number of deficiencies; namely the difficulty and expense of testing large buildings, uncertainties due to wind and buoyancy factors, uncertainties due to experimental and measurement errors, and its inability to obtain results in the range of naturally occurring pressure differences.A novel technique is being developed at the University of Nottingham which accurately relates a known volume pulse to flow through the building envelope at pressures typically found in infiltration, hence significantly improving on the current steady technique. The underlying principle of the technique is to subject the building envelope to a known volume change in a short period of time (i.e. 1.5 s). This generates a flow rate through the adventitious openings that in turn creates a pulse in the internal pressure, characteristic of the building's leakage. The basic pulse concept has been tried previously by others, but has never before been made to work. There are three key novel features that have led to its success this time. The first is to measure the pressure difference across the building envelope a short time before and after the pulse, thereby allowing wind and buoyancy effects to be largely eliminated. The second is to generate a pressure pulse in such a way that a period of quasi-steady flow is obtained, thereby eliminating inertia effects associated with unsteady flow. The third is to minimise the variation of the pressure difference during the quasi-steady period such that flexing of the building envelope is not a problem. The quasi-steady period gives directly the leakage characteristic at low pressure and after adjustment to still air conditions and a small correction for the effective flow rate arising from compressibility of the air it can be plotted in the same way as the steady technique. Work to date has focused primarily on using a piston and cylinder to generate the volume pulse. This has worked well but preliminary tests have shown that a simpler, more portable design using a nozzle may also be possible. The first aim of the proposed project will be to research the piston technique further, as testing and analysis of specific factors is still needed to remove uncertainties. The second aim will be to explore the concept of a nozzle pulse technique. This has the most potential for marketing as a low pressure leakage tester, as it would make the system even more compact and portable, hence saving transport costs and space. To date, however, it has not been possible to measure the volume change accurately. It is intended to conduct a theoretical investigation of how this may be done and then, if the theory suggests it is possible, test it experimentally. The increased demand for leakage measurement coupled with the deficiencies of the conventional method means there is a genuine need for the described technique. The technique will be quicker, cheaper, more portable and more accurate than the conventional method. As such, the potential beneficiaries will be regulators, builders/developers, and leakage testing companies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principle beneficiaries will be leakage testing companies in the commercial private sector. In recent years there has been an increase in the demand for leakage measurement, due to the increase in demand for energy efficient buildings and changes in the Building Regulations. The projected increase in need for new homes will increase the demand further in future years. However, the presently used method has a number of deficiencies, such the difficulty and expense of testing large buildings, and uncertainties due to the wind. In the past, alternative methods have been tried, but the UoN technique is believed to be the first successful one. The UoN technique would give companies the option of a more portable, reliable, quicker and easier technique for measuring air tightness. It would potentially save them money and hence make them more competitive. The technique would be available from completion of the project, however, for the technique to be fully accepted in the industry it would need to be accepted in the Building Regulations. As the new Part L comes out in 2010 this realistically means it could be included by 2014. Several companies have already expressed an interest in the technique and on completion of the project one company would be able to market it. Builders and developers also stand to benefit. At present, if a building fails the leakage test the cost of retesting can be great. The proposed technique is quicker, cheaper and less disruptive than the steady technique, so should save this group stoppage time and money. In addition it may be desirable to do pre-tests on buildings so any issues can be addressed before the official test is taken. Due to the simple nature of the test it may even be possible for builders to do tests at different stages, to identify the most effective methods for improving airtightness. This process of self screening could help to identify systematic construction problems and improve designing for airtightness and workmanship in the future. Another use, which may arise in the future, is testing of existing buildings. As property owners increasingly want to improve the energy efficiency of older buildings, the air tightness is important to consider. Due to the less disruptive nature of the UoN technique it would be ideal for this purpose. The technique should be suitable for these two uses directly on completion of the project. The third group of beneficiaries is likely to be government policy makers. When the present steady leakage test was first included in the Building Regulations there was a slow uptake by the industry and indeed enforcement by building control officers. The likely intention is to increase the standards of airtightness in future regulations, which will be easier to enforce using an easier testing method, such as the UoN technique. As the new technique has also been shown to be more accurate, the results can be relied on as a more accurate record of a building's airtightness than previously possible. This is likely to become increasingly important as the leakage levels decrease. In order to engage interested parties, the research will be published in technical journals (e.g. BSERT, ASHRAE, IJV) and presentations will be made at conferences (e.g. AIVC, European Blower Door Symposium). Input from the leakage testing industry and interested parties will be encouraged by inviting them to demonstrations of the technique on buildings in the School and elsewhere in the UK. Discussions will also be held with both industry and policy makers throughout the project to find a way to market the technique successfully and have it recognised by the Building Regulations. The School has a full-time Research Administration Manager who will assist with exploitation of the work, along with the University's Business Development Executive for Energy (Energy Technology Research Institute) and the Research Innovation Services. If appropriate, patent applications may be made.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99815</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>G?vle University College</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Sweden, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Gavle</gtr:description><gtr:id>E422A16D-3DA2-4789-864F-9551D0996A07</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference paper: 'Measurement of the adventitious leakage of churches with a novel pulse technique'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464cbb8006b70.83116070-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Testing and analysis of the airtightness of three large churches in Sweden using the piston pulse technique.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Know how for testing and analysis of the airtightness of large buildings at low pressure using the piston pulse technique.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>90000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Scaling up retrofit</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Technology Strategy Board (TSB)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>101609</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>29298767-8878-42EA-8C4F-2D3806C43AFD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464bf91a15579.80626059</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>265383</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Horizon 2020 Energy Efficient Buildings 2014</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>637221</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>156DDEE7-4AC0-4A96-95D0-062A6077E49B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464c244ae75d7.79942986</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project investigated the determination of building leakage at low pressure. An existing piston technique was improved and a new 'nozzle technique' developed. The underlying principle of both techniques is to subject a building to a known volume change in a short period of time and use the resulting pressure pulse to obtain the building airtightness at low pressures.

The main research findings include; 

1) Numerical validation for the piston technique and also the traditional steady state technique indicate the piston technique can give the low pressure leakage with reasonable accuracy. 

2) During the piston test, a leak from the narrow gap between the piston and cylinder is unavoidable, i.e. it under-estimates the flow rate from the compressor in the early stage of the pulse. However, the effects of this are not so evident, because only the latter part of the pressure pulse satisfies the quasi-steady conditions and is used for the analysis.

3) Both techniques employ portable test rigs, need only a few seconds for a test run, need not to penetrate the building envelope, and therefore can establish the leakage of a building very quickly. The nozzle device is more compact than the piston, since it generates the pressure pulse using a compressor directly and does not need heavy components. Furthermore, due to the simplification of the devices, the expense of components, transportation fees, etc. the cost of the nozzle test is lower. Moreover, unlike the piston device, where the air from compressor is obstructed by a piston during the test, the nozzle device generates the pressure pulse directly and can achieve a higher pressure and therefore is more efficient and accurate. 

4) Single /multi- nozzle and piston tests indicate that there are small differences in the power law fitting for the experimental data obtained by different tests on the same building. These small differences may cause large extrapolation errors when estimating the leakage characteristics at relatively lower or higher pressures. To test the building leakage at a specified pressure, a pulse should be generated so that the range of pressure during the quasi steady period can include or approximate this specified pressure value. 

5) Tests on large buildings indicate that multi-pistons/nozzles can generate uniform pressure pulses in the building by properly distributing the units. Results show that both techniques are both very repeatable and good agreement appears between them. 

6) Now that the nozzle technique has been well developed, it can superseded piston technique due to the higher accuracy, the higher efficiency, the higher portability, the easier operation and the lower cost.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The principle beneficiaries could be leakage testing companies in the commercial private sector.

This is likely to become increasingly important as the leakage levels decrease. 
 The research presents a new technique for accurately measuring the air tightness of buildings at low pressures, in a way that until now has not been possible. As such, the theory and method is likely to be of particular interest to any academics working in the area of building ventilation, and also for the wider academic disciplines of building services, fluid dynamics and facade engineering. The low pressure data acquired from testing may also be of interest to those in environmental design needing accurate infiltration rates for modelling of building performance. The research has developed the state of the art in these areas and could stimulate further investigation into unsteady techniques and discussion of building airtightness. 

Due to the specific application to buildings and the relevant expertise already available, collaboration with other disciplines was not necessary to meet the project objectives. However, a multidisciplinary approach may now be adopted to expand the potential impact of the technique into other areas outside of the built environment, such as train carriage and other vehicle construction. 

The research has strong potential for international collaboration in the future; as the benefits of using the technique in the UK would translate equally well to other countries. Indeed, the technique is presently being used in a collaborative project with the University of Gavle, Sweden, for testing of Swedish churches. There is the potential for accessing additional funding streams as well as developing new research ideas related to this and other research activities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>27F0560D-3221-4090-BF8D-7FC8B2C02846</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8885517417.3466177471d2a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>Build Test Solutions Ltd</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>Build Test Solutions Ltd has been created by a consortium of specialists in the energy efficiency industry.
