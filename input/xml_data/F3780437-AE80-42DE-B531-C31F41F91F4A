Several signalling mechanisms exist which detect environmental changes, leading to activation of an appropriate response. We have identified Ypp1, a protein in baker's yeast, that is a key modulator of a particular signalling pathway contributing to maintenance of the fungal cell wall. Human cells don't have a cell wall, so this structure is regarded as a principal target for the development of antifungal agents which are non-toxic to humans. Signalling pathways in pathogenic fungi and baker's yeast are similar, so we will use baker's yeast as a model organism for investigating the role of Ypp1 in maintaining fungal cell wall integrity. The precise nature by which Ypp1 affects signalling will be determined, by measuring key biochemical intermediates of the signalling pathway involved. This will be followed by assessing how loss of Ypp1 affects the responses activated by the signalling pathway, with emphasis on how the chemical structure of the cell wall is re-modelled. Also, because the genome of baker's yeast can be manipulated with ease, we will identify pathways and proteins that involve the action of Ypp1. In this way, we will identify additional targets for antifungal drug design.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Ypp1 is an essential protein found in all fungi. We have made conditional mutants of the corresponding gene in the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The lytic phenotype of these mutants at non-permissive conditions is rescued by osmotic stabilization of media, and at semi-permissive conditions the mutants are sensitive to agents that de-stabilise the cell wall. Accordingly, our preliminary data indicates that Ypp1 is required for maintenance of the fungal cell wall. The phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase Stt4 is a multicopy-suppressor of the phenotype displayed by our ypp1 mutants, implying that Ypp1 plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide metabolism. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates are widely recognized as key regulators of a broad range of signal transduction processes. We propose a multidisciplinary approach to determine how Ypp1 controls metabolism of phosphoinositide second messengers. We will measure levels of phosphoinositides in our conditional ypp1 mutants followed by assay of lipid kinase and lipid phosphatase activity from cell extracts. The physiological effects of losing Ypp1 function will be followed, especially in terms of signalling through the MAPK cascade that controls cell wall re-modelling. Screens for genetic and physical interactions with Ypp1 could reveal proteins acting downstream and upstream of this protein, with the latter being of special interest given our poor understanding of how phosphoinositide signalling is controlled at the fungal plasma membrane. Many aspects of cell wall construction and signalling are conserved between S. cerevisiae and fungal pathogens. Investigating Ypp1 function in S. cerevisiae should aid understanding of the role played by phosphoinositides in maintaining fungal cell wall integrity, and identify additional genes affecting target structures in cell walls. Given the lack of new, effective small molecule anti-fungals the work proposed should provide insight into potential novel anti-fungal drug targets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>327229</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Biosciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Endocytosis assays.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7A47ACE7-0DC7-425B-B85A-5E1F6F4FB577</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Zhai C, Li K, Markaki V, Phelan JP, Bowers K, Cooke FT, Panaretou B.

Human cells don't have a cell wall, so this structure is regarded as a principal target for the development of antifungal agents which are non-toxic to humans. Such antifungal agents would be useful for the treatment of fungi that infect humans as well as fungi that are crop pathogens. Signalling pathways in pathogenic fungi and baker's yeast are similar, so our findings are relevant in terms of understanding how fungi in general maintain the integrity of their cell walls. Specifically, we found that Ypp1 is necessary for controlling a signaling pathway that operates within the cell membrane, a structure that surrounds the cell, and is located directly beneath the cell wall. We were able to make genetically modified yeast that compromised the action of the Ypp1 protein. This resulted in fungal cell death, which was especially rapid when yeast cells were treated with compounds that damage the cell wall. Signalling pathways are usually composed of a series of proteins acting in sequence, which initially detect a change in cellular environment and transmit a signal through the cell which ultimately leads to the cell mounting a protective response. We were able to identify a protein that binds to Ypp1, enabling us to pinpoint the precise stage in the signaling pathway that is controlled by Ypp1.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have identified a protein that plays an important role in the survival of fungal cells.
