As a key supporter of Sir Robert Walpole, and a close friend of Queen Caroline, Hervey is well known to historians. He is an important primary source of information about events and personalities during much of Walpole's administration, especially in his letters to Stephen and Henry Fox, and in his manuscript Some Materials towards Memoirs of the Reign of George II, not published in full until 1931, that he left incomplete after the Queen's death. He is also important to historians of gender and sexuality for reasons indicated by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's remark that the world consisted of 'men, women, and Herveys'. To students and scholars of literature, he is most familiar as the object of a satirical attack by Alexander Pope that portrayed him as vain, unprincipled and effeminate. Pope's attack has proved so successful that hardly anyone has paid serious attention to Hervey's verse, even though his skills as memoirist, political pamphleteer and letter-writer are well-recognized. Furthermore, research into Hervey's life and writings has been dominated by historical and biographical rather than literary concerns. Yet this very talented man wrote verse throughout his life, and much of it is accomplished. While some of it was printed, not always with his consent, much of it survives in manuscripts scattered among various libraries and archives. The proposed edition aims to bring to light all his verse that can be found and to make it available.\nThe work for the edition falls into two main parts. First, bibliographical and archival research is needed to locate and identify verse by Hervey and then transcribe and edit it. For printed texts, this requires work in several major research libraries, as some are very rare and have not been digitized. Texts that survive only in manuscripts present more of a challenge. Although the majority are in three main collections, at the British Library, the West Suffolk Record Office at Bury St Edmunds, and the Harrowby Manuscripts Trust at Sandon Hall, Stafford, there is also material in, for example, the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the Brotherton Collection at the University of Leeds (which has, however, been digitized), and the Portland Collection at the University of Nottingham. Second, the verse in these texts, some of which occurs in letters, has to be transcribed accurately and then presented in a clear, accessible form with details of differences between copies where more than one exists, and notes on biographical, historical or literary contexts, and also on unusual expressions and allusions.\nIt is important that such an edition be produced both for literary and for historical reasons. While Hervey's verse is not on a footing with Pope's, it is of much greater literary value than has been appreciated. This was recognized in the eighteenth century by the quite prominent place he occupies in the best-known verse anthology of the period, Robert Dodsley's Collection of Poems by Several Hands, yet his verse that exists only in manuscript is virtually or, in a few cases, completely unknown. Examples of unpublished material that will be of special interest are his verse tragedy Agrippina, which is modelled on parallels between Nero and his mother and Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Queen Caroline; his rendering into verse of the first three books of F&amp;eacute;nelon's Les Aventures de T&amp;eacute;l&amp;eacute;maque; some of the extempore verse he embedded in letters; and three lesbian love poems that do not seem to have a satirical intent transcribed by his friend Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Publication of a critical edition of Hervey's verse will make such material available for the first time. It will provide the basis for a much fairer and more accurate assessment of his significance as a writer, and it will prove an important source for historians as well as for students and scholars of literature</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While the primary beneficiaries of the research will be the academic research and the student community, there are four areas of potential benefit to be pursued in the public sphere.\nNews and public affairs media. The questions of gender and sexuality raised by Hervey's verse, and also by his life, will have a public-affairs-interest appeal. Though any interest of a salacious nature will be discouraged, news coverage of the cross-gendered verse in the edition is capable of raising public awareness of the history of unorthodox sexual orientation, and so of helping to inform debates on the matter. The main potential beneficiary would be the general public; victims of discrimination on grounds of gender or sexuality would also benefit, but they are addressed in the paragraph below. While it is not possible to ensure benefits of this type, steps will be taken to publicize the edition to news and public affairs media in order at least to enable them.\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender associations. By extension, the same kinds of awareness would be useful to groups promoting awareness of alternative forms of sexuality and gender orientation such as Stonewall, the Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, and other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender associations. Hervey already features in publications and on websites about gay sexuality. The edition will provide accurate texts that will better inform discussion of his gender orientation. Beneficiaries would include not only victims of discrimination on grounds of gender or sexuality, but also the wider public interested in finding out more about such questions through history. Contact will be made with the main international interest groups and organizations.\nCreative, performing and popular arts. There are two main kinds of potential for interest in the performance media. First, Hervey's cross-gendered verse and its relation to his life are likely to appeal to cultural and historical programmers at the BBC. Poetry is already quite well represented on Radio Three, as are programmes about cultural history. Beneficiaries would be radio listeners, and contact will be made to explore possibilities with potential producers. Second, Hervey's verse tragedy 'Agrippina' offers several kinds of potential for performance. Although it seems unlikely that it was intended for professional theatre production, it could provide interesting and unusual performance opportunities, including of selected speeches and scenes, for student and amateur groups. It will be offered for this purpose to staff and students in my own Department as a way of testing its potential usefulness and adaptability. That would create an opportunity for offering it outside the academy. A further potential is for stage and even cinematic adaptation. While this is proposed as a speculative possibility rather than a definite objective, the subject-matter would lend itself to such adaptation because of its highly dramatic nature. Potential beneficiaries range from those involved in amateur drama as practitioners and audiences to professionals and much wider audiences if the speculative possibility of film adaptation were to develop. Initial contact in order to explore such opportunities will be made through colleagues in my Department who have connections with drama and film organizations.\nCultural history. Fuller knowledge of Hervey's verse will add to the information available at Ickworth House and Park, now maintained by the National Trust. The estate belonged to Hervey's family for generations, and, while the house in which he lived no longer exists, the Trust is an important source of local knowledge and history. Beneficiaries would be the Trust itself, visitors, and those interested in the history of the local community, which Hervey served as a Member of Parliament before his elevation to the House of Lords.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025220/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
