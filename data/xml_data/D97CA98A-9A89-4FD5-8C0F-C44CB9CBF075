This is an important message for the 285 million people worldwide that the World Health Organisation estimates to live with visual impairments, for their families and carers, and the growing number of people anticipated to encounter sight loss in the future (with the rising incidence of underlying causes such as diabetes, and an ageing population). 

Recognising the vitalising influence of the wider senses is also important for researchers exploring the positive impacts of natural environment experiences on human emotions, health and wellbeing. Much of this work emphasises the visual sense, highlighting the importance of colours, people 'watching', viewing distant horizons, and the sense of space achieved through visual encounters with these settings. Yet, when we stop to think about the global prevalence of visual impairment (now and in the future), we realise that sight cannot be taken for granted as the most important means of interacting with the natural world. 

The aims of this Future Research Leaders project are to explore how and why natural environments (including our back gardens, local parks, woodlands, countryside and coastlines) feature within the everyday lives of people living with sight loss. It will examine how diverse visual impairments shape people's opportunities for positive and therapeutic experiences in nature. It will also explore how this varies between individuals with different life histories, including those born with a visual impairment and those faced with sight loss later in life.

An in-depth two-phase research approach will be used to explore these issues. In Phase I, 3-4 months will be spent volunteering with visual impairment support groups across the south west of England (described as 'ethnographic participation'), helping out with indoor and outdoor recreational and support activities. Through maximising opportunities to spend time with and talk to adult participants living with visual impairments during this period, valuable relationships will be built and initial understandings gained of the wider sensory abilities and experiences of these individuals. 

Phase II will involve two sets of interviews with visually impaired adults at different life stages and with varying forms of sight loss. The first interview (an in-depth 'narrative' interview) will examine the impacts of visual impairment on varied aspects of their daily lives and place interactions. It will also explore recalled shifts in these experiences during their lifetimes. The second interview (a 'go along' interview) will take place in a setting identified by each participant as a local 'natural' environment in which they feel a sense of wellbeing. Whilst there, participants will be asked to reflect on and explain the diverse sensory, emotional and social dimensions of their experiences in that environment.

In exploring these aspects of experience, this research will provide novel understandings of the non-visual cues in nature that we respond to. It will address calls to explore the conditions that enable flourishing lives amongst individuals living with visual impairments rather than focusing solely on narratives of loss, and will promote greater sensory awareness amongst the diverse stakeholders involved in the delivery of socially inclusive natural environment interactions. 

Dr. Bell will convene and lead a series of stakeholder engagement and dissemination events, alongside the production of high profile academic outputs, in order to raise awareness of how visually impaired individuals can support and sustain a sense of wellbeing through interactions with the natural environment. In doing so, and through a tailored skills development plan, she will strengthen her position as a future research leader.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study has the potential to generate both 'conceptual' impact ('enlightenment' of publics and societal groups, reframing debates) and 'instrumental' impact (altering behaviour, influencing the development of policy and/or practice) (Meagher et al., 2008). Four highly appropriate target end-user groups beyond academia include:

1. Visual impairment support and advocacy groups (e.g. Action for the Blind, Royal National Institute for the Blind, Guide Dogs UK, iSight Cornwall): participant narratives emerging from the study will be used to inform the strategies used by these groups to support visually impaired individuals (and their families/carers) in identifying and engaging in pleasurable, fulfilling place experiences in their local areas. Taking part in this kind of narrative research can also promote the wellbeing of the participants themselves by providing a supportive opportunity for them to make sense of and articulate their experiences in their own words (Dale, 2010). Although a small-scale impact, being genuinely listened to is deeply important for those involved (Dale, 2008). 

2. Landscape architects and planners will be encouraged to use the research findings to better accommodate the specific needs of those with visual impairments when designing and planning communities. Dr. Bell will organise a design workshop for interested landscape architects, planners and national/international 'umbrella' organisations (e.g. the Design Council, the Royal Institute of British Architects, the WHO European Healthy Cities Network) to develop practical recommendations about how urban communities and their green/blue spaces could be choreographed to achieve a better balance between &amp;quot;functionality, durability and delight&amp;quot; (Landscape Institute, 2013: 2) for those living with sight loss. Dr. Bell will collaborate with the Design Council to incorporate these recommendations within the Continuing Professional Development materials available within their online 'Inclusive Environments Hub'.

3. Land-owning and recreational organisations (e.g. National Trust, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds - RSPB, Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust - WWT, Wildlife Trusts) will gain valuable insights into how to broaden engagement with and enjoyment of their varied sites amongst currently under-represented visually impaired users. Through a dedicated workshop and follow-up visits, Dr. Bell will collaborate with these organisations to develop and embed a series of tailored guidelines that will support positive sensory experiences on-site amongst diverse visually impaired visitors. These will need to cater for potential feelings of vulnerability without comprising the right to adventure and pleasurable immersion. The RSPB and WWT have already expressed interest in this process.

4. Local and national policy representatives will need to provide strategic support to the organisations (including those above) responsible for facilitating positive natural environment experiences amongst visually impaired individuals. In order to encourage this in the study area, Dr. Bell will join the stakeholder groups of the six Local Nature Partnerships (LNPs) within south west England, contributing to LNP stakeholder meetings, consultations and annual conferences as appropriate. LNPs are partnerships of diverse local organisations and businesses who aim to improve their local natural environments for both social and ecological benefit (with many incorporating specific working groups on health and wellbeing). At the national level, Dr. Bell will discuss the study with interested LNPs beyond the study area, and attend quarterly meetings of Natural England's cross-sector 'Outdoors for All' Working Group which aims to improve opportunities for all people in England to enjoy and benefit from the natural environment.

The specific activities that will be organised to maximise opportunities for these impacts are described in the 'Pathways to Impact'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N015851/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1D32A760-9B88-43D4-8BDA-F0236A67470A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
