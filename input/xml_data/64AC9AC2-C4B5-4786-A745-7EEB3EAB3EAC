In Malaysia, the breast cancer incidence has increased rapidly for the past two decades, albeit that it is still less than half of that in Europeans. The rapid increased incidence has been associated with changing lifestyle, such as decreased parity, no/short period of breastfeeding, and increasing Westernisation and urbanization. Breast cancer is now the most common cancer across all ethnicities in Malaysia, accounting for 31% of cancers in women, and it is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Early detection by screening can reduce breast cancer mortality. However, due to lack of funding within the national health services and lack of justification for population-based screening, only opportunistic screening is practiced. This is suboptimal and inequitable. A viable alternative approach is to improve screening strategies by identifying high-risk women who should be targeted for screening. In this proposal, we plan to bring technological advances in the understanding of breast cancer genetics to develop tools that can be used identify women who are at higher risk of developing breast cancer so that early detection and disease prevention interventions become possible. The findings of this research will inform the development of appropriate management to ensure that healthcare resources can be used efficiently for targeted screening and prevention.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Breast cancer is rising rapidly in Asia and is the most common cause of cancer related deaths in Malaysia. Notably, whereas 80% of breast cancer in the UK occurs in post-menopausal women, only 40% occurs in post-menopausal women in Malaysia, and the proportion of risk attributable to genetic factors is likely to be correspondingly higher. In the absence of population-based screening, targeted screening is a viable cost-effective alternative in reducing breast cancer mortality. It has been shown that polygenic risk scores (PRS) constructed using breast cancer-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) improve risk stratification in European and East Asian populations. However, there have been no/little studies in South-East Asian, especially Malay and Indian populations - two of the largest ethnic groups in Malaysia and Singapore. In this proposal, using data from Malaysian and Singaporean populations and genome-wide associated SNPs from large Asian cohorts (data generated in the Asian Breast Cancer Consortium and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium), we plan to develop optimal PRS for predicting breast cancer risk in women from all ethnic backgrounds in Malaysia and Singapore. The findings of this research will facilitate the wider use of clinical genetic testing and the development of informed risk-stratified approaches to screening.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Early intervention in cancer care is cheaper and more effective than intervention at a later stage. The aim of the proposed research is to a develop risk stratification tool that can be used to identify Malaysian and Singaporean women who are at higher-risk of developing breast cancer. Thus, it is intended that women of general public will be direct beneficiaries of this project. With the reliably accurate risk assessment tool available, screening strategies could be improved by targeting those most likely to benefit. Equally, by having a score that can indicate whether a woman is likely to develop breast cancer, clinicians can develop more personalized clinical management, while women can make more informed choices. Notably, the proposed research is the first study that aims to develop risk-stratification tools for Malay and Indian women.

In Malaysia, there is limited expertise in genetic analysis and risk prediction modeling which are both important fields in cancer research. Involvement of international participants in the programme will provide an opportunity to strengthen the knowledge in these fields and to strengthen links with cancer researchers beyond Malaysia and UK. In longer term, more international collaborations could be established. This would improve the research capabilities and capacities in the country.

Moreover, the risk prediction models developed in the current proposal may be relevant for women from ethnic minorities in the UK, for whom the current breast cancer risk prediction models are not appropriate. Well-calibrated models for women of Asian ancestry could be incorporated in the current risk prediction tool, BOADICEA, for use in clinical practice in order to counsel women of Asian ancestry both in Malaysia, Singapore, UK and other countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>408723</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6CE245A4-1070-403F-AB24-A24389AED805</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mutational spectrum in a worldwide study of 29,700 families with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Human mutation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/34fd4c81a0fb7a4a83ce20125232d968"><gtr:id>34fd4c81a0fb7a4a83ce20125232d968</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rebbeck TR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1059-7794</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa64bee43cc38.17296086</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>25EFB583-047C-4413-86D4-10533E9EAA73</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inherited mutations inandin an unselected multiethnic cohort of Asian patients with breast cancer and healthy controls from Malaysia.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of medical genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/17ce7a5b239fe319e67068a17bfa358a"><gtr:id>17ce7a5b239fe319e67068a17bfa358a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wen WX</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-2593</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>59e9ee2f002728.23750973</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P012930/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E8160779-C41E-46F6-B795-59C27D6B2E2B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.3  Influences and impact</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>5C2ACE0A-A29E-4DCC-9F5A-B00BFAB172B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.4  Population screening</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
