There have been at least five major extinctions since then, most recently the famous event 65Ma, that wiped out the dinosaurs. Life has shown itself to be remarkably resilient, and it follows that mass extinctions result from serious environmental stress. We live in a time of growing concern that Earth is about to see, or already is going through, a modern mass extinction to rival those of the geological past. In June 2011, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported that a combination of environmental stresses on the oceans is creating the conditions associated with every previous mass extinction. The greatest threats are warming (mainly from greenhouse gases), marine oxygen depletion, ocean acidification, and eutrophication (a process that leads to blooms in life but can ultimately destabilise ecosystems). The difference between these threats in the past and present is that today they have a human origin. In the past they may have resulted from catastrophic volcanism, with widespread volcanic rocks (known as &amp;quot;large igneous provinces&amp;quot;) associated with most extinctions. The underlying cause of change may be different between past and present, but there is concern that the effect (extinction) may be the same. 

We can learn much from Earth's past, and parallels can be drawn between future scenarios, and mass extinctions in the geological record. All of the aforementioned environmental stresses have been suggested as causes of the biggest crisis of all time, at the close of the Permian (251Ma), when 95% of species disappeared. Similar environmental changes have also been implicated in an earlier extinction in the Middle Permian (260Ma), and another at the end of the subsequent Triassic period (200Ma). This 60 million year interval witnessed some of the most important and remarkable events in the history of the planet, each extinction fundamentally shaping evolution and therefore our very existence.

In this project I will study each of the three events between 260-200Ma, paying particular attention to Polar north oceans, an area known as the &amp;quot;Boreal Realm&amp;quot;. Not only are past extinctions poorly understood in the Boreal Realm, this region has greatest uncertainty in the future. My investigations will start with geological fieldwork in Spitsbergen and Siberia, both regions that in the Permian and Triassic, as now, were located in the Arctic. I will sample the three extinction intervals, and my first objective will be to work out when, and how severe the extinctions were, and which species were most affected. I will do this using microscope slides of my samples. I will use several techniques to evaluate which environmental stresses were the likely causes of these crises. These techniques include geochemical analyses of molybdenum and strontium isotopes, looking at tiny pyrite blobs under a high-power microscope, and using an extremely powerful computer model, known as GENIE, all of which tell us about past oceans. A major challenge is to correlate rocks from the Polar regions with those from the tropics, in order to work out whether the Polar oceans suffered more, or less. I will produce a &amp;quot;chemical clock&amp;quot; based on carbon isotopes in the rocks, which will allow me to match sequences in Spitsbergen and Russia with those from elsewhere.

The main goal of this project is to identify whether there is a latitudinal variation to extinction risk. This might influence the fate of Boreal communities in the future, and my study will inform future governance of the world's oceans, as we look to prevent a contemporary mass extinction. The results will not only be useful for geologists, but also to policy makers that extend through groups such as IUCN, right up to the United Nations, that is ultimately charged with protecting our oceans for future generations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who?

This project will compile publishable data from an important period in Earth history, and evaluate several environmental stresses invoked in extinction scenarios. The beneficiaries are many because this topic is a focus of the Earth science research agenda that holds great interest for the wider public as concerns grow about a modern mass extinction. Unusually for an extinction study, the project has been designed in consultation with policy groups involved with modern ocean governance (e.g. IUCN and IPSO). Thus, while the project will deliver fundamental knowledge about the causes and consequences of environmental change in deep time, it is intended to have impact with conservation, policy and governmental groups. Wider beneficiaries include academics from other disciplines (Earth system modellers, climate scientists), undergraduates, the scientifically literate public, school teachers, and children.

How?

Academic users beyond my immediate field include Earth system modellers, climate scientists and those working on modern Boreal ecosystems. The research will be published in high-impact journals and presented at international conferences. Two high profile project workshops will engage diverse academic groups with policy makers and the general public; the proceedings will be published on an open access basis.

Specific objectives map onto a number of wider academic users:

a) developing a Boreal Permian to Jurassic chemostratigraphy will stimulate further multidisciplinary research in the region by providing a timeframe for other studies;
b) evaluating the relative impact of environmental stresses in the Boreal Realm will be relevant to those who study extinctions, palaeoclimates, and oceanography;
c) employing the GENIE model to evaluate past ocean redox and pH states (the latter being a major conundrum in Earth science) will further develop a promising tool with wide ranging applications;
d) identifying latitudinal bias to extinction risk will be a fundamental achievement with widespread impact for Earth historians and our approach to modern ecology and environmental governance.

Policy makers will benefit especially from outputs b) and d). The results feed into ocean governance because they will evaluate different threats in the Boreal Realm (and the likelihood of Boreal vs. low latitude losses in the near future), and will potentially influence future research funding and focus. These end users will be involved in workshops that will engage them in the research and encourage two-way knowledge exchange that can shape the latter part of the project and my future research.

Extinction and climate are popular topics for non-academic users. Increasing understanding of past global change benefits society by profoundly influencing how we see the world in which we live. Traditional and novel mediums will be employed to communicate with graduate and undergraduate geoscientists and scientists from other disciplines, the general public, school teachers, and children. These groups have been exposed to this highly active research area over the past two decades through popular media. Several strategies will facilitate their engagement:

Workshop: These will engage not only scientific users but also undergraduates and the general public because they will encouraged to attend, and talks will be broadcast online and published in open access reports / press releases.
Website: Designed for various academic levels, this will include images / videos of fieldwork, research &amp;quot;tutorials&amp;quot; and posters for schools (a learning and teaching resource for key stages 3-5).
Mass media: Press releases will target papers and television, a highly successful strategy in communicating science to a wide audience.
Outreach and teaching: Students will benefit from interactive events (as part of Science Week) promoting understanding of the topic. Undergraduates will benefit because the research will feed into my research-led teaching.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>595596</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Natural Resources Canada</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>GSC</gtr:description><gtr:id>4C34840E-FC5C-422C-9C99-712216F50949</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Update 2016: very successful 2015 fieldwork - this is expected to result in numerous publications in 2017/18.

In 2016 I published nine journal articles related to this grant, including ground-breaking work that develops mercury as a proxy for ancient volcanism and a major review of mass extinction events that is currently in the top 5% of all research outputs scored by Altmetric. Some of these are likely 3* and 4* outputs that will form part of my REF return. The key findings of this research are:

Mercury as a proxy for ancient volcanism and its record of deposition in association with three extinction events in NW Pangea (and possible causal role in those events).
The extent of ultra-shallow marine anoxia in the Early Triassic of Spitsbergen and it role in the suppression of benthic radiation.
The record of climate warming, euxinia and carbon isotope perturbations during the Carnian (Triassic) Crisis and their role in extinctions.
A revised Permian (Artinskian to Wuchapingian) conodont biostratigraphy for China.
The extent of an anoxic event in the Triassic of the South China Block and its implications for the cause(s) of oxygen depletion.

Ongoing collaborations with the Geol. Survey of Canada, the Karpinsky Institute and RAS in Russia have led to more fieldwork in 2016 (2 x months in Russia) collecting samples that are bearing fruit for publication in 2017 and beyond.

So far, the project has met the objectives planned for Year 3 of the work programme.

Updated February 2016 (see previous entry below for reference):

The project has expanded significantly over the past year. I have developed some strong links with the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) and spent a month in the Canadian Arctic (July 2015) sampling Triassic strata for further geochemical analyses. Several papers have been published in the past year. Highlights include:

We now think that ocean acidification and anoxia played a role in the Middle Permian mass extinction, which we have now demonstrated to be a true, global mass extinction;

We have identified a pulse of extreme global warming in the Triassic strata of China that indicates sea temperatures reached up to 45 C in the Smithian-Spathian interval, one that saw yet another mass extinction associated with global warming;

Later in the Triassic the enigmatic Carnian Pluvial Event (a period that saw the evolution of the dinosaurs and a major change in global climate to warm and wet) was driven by volcanically-induced global warming;

Much earlier, I have worked on Devonian rocks in Nevada, and identified a polychaete worm - this fills a gap in the fossil record of these enigmatic organisms spanning about 200 million years;

Fieldwork in Canada, the USA, and Russia (with much more planned for 2016) has yielded abundant samples for ongoing analysis through the remainder of the project. Currently at its midway point, the project is progressing according to plan.

As of late 2014:

The project is in its early stages (month 14 of 60) but already successful fieldwork in Spitsbergen and Siberia (two main field areas identified by the project) has led to the detailed sampling and recovery of materials for palaeontological and geochemical analysis (Russian samples have arrived UK, Oct. 2014 - this itself is a major achievement). Analyses of the Spitsbergen materials has yielded significant new knowledge and important results (in review for publication). The research has uncovered a major, and abrupt mass extinction in the Middle Permian Boreal Realm (high northern latitudes). This extinction appears to be synchronous with low latitude losses, indicating a mass extinction on a global scale. The cause of this extinction remains highly controversial but the research implies a link to large scale volcanism in southern China, which may have caused acidification stresses in the cooler, high latitudes. This is manifest as extinction of carbonate shelled organisms (e.g. brachiopods) and the near total loss of carbonates across the region. The work has generated much interest from the media, resulting in several publications (details in other sections).
Analyses of the Spitsbergen materials have also resulted in the first high resolution chemostratigraphy for the Boreal Realm, allowing events elsewhere (e.g. the Siberian data) to be placed within a temporal framework. This framework will also be of use to other scientists working on the Permian of the high latitudes.
New or improved research methods or skills developed: the Fellow (Bond) has developed significant new research skills in e.g. brachiopod and bivalve taxonomy to complement his existing skills in microfossil taxonomy; and stable isotope analysis of C and Sr. Modelling work identified in the proposal is planned for the coming year. The above research and new skills have resulted in 5 papers currently &amp;quot;in review&amp;quot; in addition to the published papers listed in the outputs section.
Noteworthy new research partnerships have stemmed from two successful field expeditions to Russia in 2014 (to Siberia with project partner A. Biakov of the Russian Academy of Sciences; to Vladivostok with project partner O. Kossovaya of the Karpinsky Geological Research Institute). These two partnerships are absolutely key to the success of the project because without them the fieldwork in Russia and subsequent recovery of materials would be impossible.
A further important development is a new partnership that has arisen with the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC; Government of Canada: Natural Resources Canada). Through this partnership (not identified in the project proposal), fieldwork to Ellesmere Island (Arctic Canada) is planned for 2015. This will greatly enhance the project by providing comparable materials from a geographically distinct region. The GSC will cover the full cost of an otherwise extremely expensive field expedition, thus providing excellent value for money for NERC.

The project has met the original objectives planned for Year 1 of the work programme.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Update February 2016:

The past year has seen the project's outputs feature widely in the popular media (BBC, multiple magazines including New Scientist, and newspapers, e.g. Washington Post). The public dissemination of the 6th mass extinction has been excellent. It is hoped over the remainder of the project this data can be put to use by policy makers.

As of late 2014:

The research is in its early stages but results are starting to be published. Ultimately the findings are intended to be of use to policy makers, because the research will test for a latitudinal bias to extinction risk (i.e. whether palaeo-Arctic regions were more at risk from environmental change in the past). However, significant research needs to be done in the next 2-3 years before the findings will be conclusive enough to engage policy makers.

The research is of wider public interest and even in its early stages the findings have stimulated interest in the topic of palaeontology and mass extinctions in the print and online media (see further details in sections on engagement).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>56F408A3-B6AE-4DD1-898D-ACEDC260CB74</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a2dee4cfe41.37258075</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>My research has generated the first high resolution chemostratigraphy for the Permian of the Boreal Realm (specifically Spitsbergen), and this data is currently in press.
