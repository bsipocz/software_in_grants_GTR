Software</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N018958/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&amp;quot;Software is the most prevalent of all the instruments used in modern science&amp;quot; [Goble 2014]. Scientific software is not just widely used [SSI 2014] but also widely developed. Yet much of it is developed by researchers who have little understanding of even the basics of modern software development with the knock-on effects to their productivity, and the reliability, readability and reproducibility of their software [Nature Biotechnology]. Many are long-tail researchers working in small groups - even Big Science operations like the SKA are operationally undertaken by individuals collectively.
 
Technological development in software is more like a cliff-face than a ladder - there are many routes to the top, to a solution. Further, the cliff face is dynamic - constantly and quickly changing as new technologies emerge and decline. Determining which technologies to deploy and how best to deploy them is in itself a specialist domain, with many features of traditional research.

Researchers need empowerment and training to give them confidence with the available equipment and the challenges they face. This role, akin to that of an Alpine guide, involves support, guidance, and load carrying. When optimally performed it results in a researcher who knows what challenges they can attack alone, and where they need appropriate support. Guides can help decide whether to exploit well-trodden paths or explore new possibilities as they navigate through this dynamic environment.

These guides are highly trained, technology-centric, research-aware individuals who have a curiosity driven nature dedicated to supporting researchers by forging a research software support career. Such Research Software Engineers (RSEs) guide researchers through the technological landscape and form a human interface between scientist and computer. A well-functioning RSE group will not just add to an organisation's effectiveness, it will have a multiplicative effect since it will make every individual researcher more effective. It has the potential to improve the quality of research done across all University departments and faculties.

My work plan provides a bottom-up approach to providing RSE services that is distinctive from yet complements the top-down approach provided by the EPRSC-funded Software Sustainability Institute.

The outcomes of this fellowship will be:

Local and National RSE Capability: A RSE Group at Sheffield as a credible roadmap for others pump-priming a UK national research software capability; and a national Continuing Professional Development programme for RSEs.

Scalable software support methods: A scalable approach based on &amp;quot;nudging&amp;quot;, to providing research software support for scientific software efficiency, sustainability and reproducibility, with quality-guidelines for research software and for researchers on how best to incorporate research software engineering support within their grant proposals.

HPC for long-tail researchers: 'HPC-software ramps' and a pathway for standardised integration of HPC resources into Desktop Applications fit for modern scientific computing; a network of HPC-centric RSEs based around shared resources; and a portfolio of new research software courses developed with partners.

Communication and public understanding: A communication campaign to raise the profile of research software exploiting high profile social media and online resources, establishing an informal forum for research software debate.

It will deliver improvements in the availability, usability and awareness of research software and best practice in its use and development. The impacts will be felt both at the University of Sheffield and across the national research software landscape. Through collaboration with commercial and non-commercial partners and delivery of ideas both in Sheffield and across the UK, I expect to provide a framework for research software support that will be used as an international exemplar of best practice.

My workplan provides a bottom-up approach to providing RSE services that is distinctive from yet complements the top-down approach provided by the EPRSC-funded Software Sustainability Institute.

Academic researchers and RSEs at The University of Sheffield will benefit from the formation of a RSE group whose remit is to provide scalable RSE support to the entire University. This group will directly improve academic software, provide a wide range of training opportunities, advise on best practice and directly contribute to research grants. The RSE profession will benefit from the creation of this high-profile node in the national RSE network.

Academic researchers and RSEs around the UK will benefit from the formation of a RSE brokerage. Seeded initially by effort from The Software Sustainability Institute, Manchester, UCL and Sheffield (See letters of support), this will form a national RSE capability. This capability will be enhanced through the development of a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme.

Commercial developers of scientific software will contribute to and benefit from the development of research software guidelines aimed at easing integration into commercial products. The RSE CPD programme will take contributions from commercial partners (see letters of support) which will assist them in developing closer links with academia and disseminating their latest products and features.

Academic researchers and RSEs around the world will benefit from the open course materials developed in collaboration with high-profile project partners including Microsoft Research, the N8 research partnership of northern universities and Software Sustainability Institute (see letters of support). Initial outputs will include 'HPC Carpentry' and 'Software and Data Carpentry for Windows'.

All users and developers of research software will benefit from the wide range of articles published on social media, blogs and websites. In particular, the 'long tail' of self-taught research software developers will have access to a large quantity of quality advice and tutorial materials developed as a result of RSE consultancy activities. These will be disseminated on my popular (500,00 annual visitors) website, www.walkingrandomly.com along with the websites of project partners.

The improved research made possible by the improved software landscape will benefit the wider public. Previous work includes research in areas such as land-mine detection, radio astronomy, medical image processing, computational finance, numerical algorithms, pure mathematics and functional genomics. It is expected that the support provided by this fellowship will increase the breadth and depth of such contributions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>507674</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>RodentDataAnalytics</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE73A564-9EEC-4E7F-B117-0E06F4A38BC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Software at https://github.com/RodentDataAnalytics/mwm-ml-gen</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c0296b602659.99149751-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The science and methodology behind the software was developed the academic partners.

I was invited to give a keynote talk: The Rich/Poor Divide in Research Software

Computer-supported modelling and simulation is now widely recognised as the third `leg` of scientific method, alongside theory and experimentation. There are many phenomena which can be studied using only computational processes, which require the use of research software, for example the analysis of experimental data. Software is fundamental to research and according to a report by the Software Sustainability Institute 7 out of 10 researchers report their work would be impossible without it. A large amount of intellectual property, knowledge and understanding resides in software, and this is why software has such longevity: people replace their hardware, but don't dispose of their codes.

EPSRC recognised the importance of software and the need for it to be regarded as an infrastructure in its own right. EPSRC published the Software as an Infrastructure strategy in 2012 to ensure that our investments added value to the software landscape and supported the Engineering and Physical Sciences Community. Furthermore, we also published an e-infrastructure roadmap , which highlighted the importance of investing in software. 

1.2 The need for a new strategy
The EPSRC Software as an Infrastructure Strategy and associated action plan was published in 2012 following a community workshop and consultation. Four years on, inevitably, the desired outcomes for the software landscape have evolved. EPSRC have also published our new Delivery Plan, which outlines how we will deliver our strategy for the period of 2016-2020, and we have a renewed vision for software. 

Our vision is for Software as an Infrastructure to continue to receive support and deliver a robust, long-term programme and vision to support the research, development, management and maintenance of high-quality, robust, recognised and accredited software for the scientific communities. 
With this new vision and the changes to the software landscape since our current strategy was published it is essential that we update and implement a new strategy for 2016-2020. With this in mind, we are holding the software strategy workshop to gain input from the community about how to refresh our strategy. 
1.3 Aims of the software workshop

The aims of this Software workshop are to:

? Gain community feedback on key priorities in software to address in the future. 
? Gain input from the community on how to ensure a long term strategy for software.
? Get advice on new objectives that require action and investment in the short, medium and long term.

The aim of this briefing is to: 

? Provide some background information on the Software as an Infrastructure strategy. 
? Present a summary of EPSRC's investments since 2012.
? Present EPSRC's proposed framework for a new software strategy.
? Provide further information about the workshop sessions. 
? Give some background on the software landscape in the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6f956de4034.31209567</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>___ and R: How R relates to other technologies</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC2059FD-85D4-4ACE-B6F6-F2E19D43CB2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a presentation given to the Sheffield R User's group, a grassroots club made up of enthusiasts, researchers and industrial users of R.

Our current dependence on software across the sciences is already significant, yet there are still more opportunities to be explored and risks to be overcome. The academic context is unique in terms of its personnel, its goals of exploring the unknown and its demands on quality assurance and reproducibility.

We refer to the IEEE Internet Computing article &amp;quot;Better Software, Better Research&amp;quot; which motivated the topic. In this workshop we took the following perspective of a research team which is in either or both of the following situations:

consuming or producing software as an output of the academic process;
consuming or producing software as a component of the research methods.

Society is now in the tricky situation where several deeply established academic fields (eg physics, biology, mathematics) are shifting towards dependence on software, programming technology and software engineering methodology which are backed only by young and rapidly evolving fields of research (computer science and software engineering). Full accountability and even validity of software-based research results are now duly being challenged.

With the outputs of this interactive and productive perspectives workshop, we strive to contribute in a positive manner to the above challenges. We formulated taxonomies with definitions to clarify the domain, we co-authored concrete policy and process documents to improve the status and recognition of academic software development and academic software engineers, and finally we formulated a list of 18 concrete declarations of intent (&amp;quot;I will&amp;quot; pledges). This list was presented to the WSSSPE community in September 2016 to acquire feedback and it will be the backbone of the Dagstuhl Manifesto document we are editing. It serves to motivate change by proposing policy changes with concrete actions and instilling positive attitudes towards academic software.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c07e6172a2.67885386</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.dagstuhl.de/de/programm/kalender/semhp/?semnr=16252</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>41688</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Out of Our Minds - Research Leadership Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2022-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Leverhulme Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>EC2D4AA8-A49D-4048-A678-956F70094929</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c02662b64da0.38352502</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Best Practice for Code Archiving in Ecology</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>23D158F5-F2F4-43F0-B058-6C4CBD3798A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At the 2016 British Ecological Society annual meeting in Liverpool the Methods in Ecology and Evolution(MEE) team held a half-day workshop on 'Best Practice for Archiving Code'.

The idea for the workshop came from a meeting several members of the journal editorial board held earlier in 2016 to discuss the complex issues around publishing code. MEE, like all the BES journals, supports the principles of open science and they want to make sure that code published in their journal is readily available to readers and adheres to key principles of quality, usability, accessibility and functionality.

Coding is becoming a more and more important skill for ecologists to have, but often training is not readily available and ecologists tend to be self-taught. MEE wants to introduce guidance for authors so that published code is as useful as possible to their readership. However, they do not want potential authors to feel that they lack the coding prowess to adhere to our guidelines and so be put off from publishing with us. They therefore designed a workshop with two aims:

* To give attendees training in using code in their research and getting it ready to publish and
* To consult participants on the usefulness of our proposed code guidelines for authors.

The training section of the workshop took the form of three practicals led by experienced experts. On the day, the sessions were guided exercises but each has been designed as a self-learning module so for people who were not there, but are interested in learning more, they can access all the practicals at https://github.com/BES2016Workshop

Laura Graham, an ecologist with a background as a data analyst, taught delegates how to write reproducible code in R, giving them a reproducible workflow that can easily be revisited at a later date.

Tamora James, an ecologist with a programming background, led a session on version control using GitHub. Version control is the process of tracking changes to documents and code over time, giving delegates a flexible way to manage and share their code.

Finally, Mike Croucher, a software engineer with experience providing training to ecologists, led a session on code publication and citation. He introduced the group to the Software Citation Principles as developed by a Force 11 working group and to Zenodo, a service developed by CERN that allows publishing research objects such as scripts, data and software packages in a way that satisfies the software citation principles.

The second section of the workshop was a consultation with delegates on MEE's draft code guidelines. Led by MEE Executive Editor Rob Freckleton, this raised some interesting questions from the audience, including:

* How should we deal with new releases of software after publication of papers?
* To what extent should we expect reviewers to peer review code?
* Where should we draw the line between good practice, which is practical to adhere to for the community, and best practice - a gold standard which might be practically unattainable.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfee1f495489.24392356</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/workshop-best-practice-code-archiving/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Using modern and open RSE technologies such as Sphinx, GitHub and ReadTheDocs we have developed a collaborative documentation system for Sheffield's local High Performance Computing System.
