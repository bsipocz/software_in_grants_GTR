Thesefoundations sometimes shift. We want to investigate where foundationscome from, how they change, and how AI researchers can use these ideasto create more flexible systems. For instance, Euclid formulatedgeometric axioms which were thought to describe the physicalworld. These were the foundations on which concepts, theorems andproofs in Euclidean geometry rested. Euclidean geometry was latermodified by rejecting the parallel postulate, and non-Euclideangeometries were formed, along with new sets of concepts andtheorems. Another example of axiomatic change is in Hilbert'sformalisation of geometry: initially his axioms contained hiddenassumptions which were soon discovered and made explicit. Paradoxesfound in Frege's axiomatisation of number theory led to Zermelo andFraenkel modifying some of his axioms in order to prevent problem setsfrom being constructed. On a less celebrated, but equally remarkable,level children are able to formulate mathematical rules about theirenvironment such as transitivity or the commutativity of arithmetic,and to modify these rules if necessary. It is astonishing that humansare able to form mathematical concepts, to abstract mathematicalrules, to explore the space that these rules define, and to modify therules in the face of counterexamples or other problems. Recent workin cognitive science by Lakoff and Nunez and in the philosophy ofmathematics by Lakatos suggests ways in which this may be done. Weintend to construct and evaluate a computational theory and model ofthis process and to explore the application of our model to AI andsoftware engineering. This is an ambitious project, with thepotential to bring together and deeply influence diverse fieldsincluding cognitive science, automated mathematical reasoning,situated embodied agents, and AI problem solving domains which wouldbenefit from a more flexible approach. Developing a set of automatedtechniques which are able to take a problem and change it into adifferent, more interesting problem could have great impact on thesedomains. In particular, we aim to explore the application of ourtheory and model to constraint satisfaction problems and softwarespecifications requirements. A general theory of how constraints,specifications or goals can be formulated and reformulated could leadto a communal set of powerful new AI techniques</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74143</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>While it is still too early to know the full impact of this work, it has motivated us, through one of our industrial partners, to investigate how a refinement style of modelling could be used to add rigor to their existing informal early design and hazard analysis processes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>66185A4D-C232-48C6-858D-9737158C84AF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54624e5e708d74.45939984</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Formal modelling and reasoning are closely related activities. In particular, modelling decisions are typically informed by the analysis of failed proofs. While such analysis is not intellectually challenging from the perspective of mathematical reasoning, it does represent a major barrier to the uptake of formal design methods by mainstream software engineers - whose intuitions lie in modelling and not proof. This problem is exacerbated by the huge number of proof obligations that arise during industrial scale developments. Overcoming this barrier would increase the accessibility and productivity of formal design methods, and ultimately the dependability and security of software intensive systems. Our project developed the notion of reasoned modelling, which aims to reduce this barrier. In essence we developed techniques that abstract away from the complexities of low-level proof obligations, in particular proof-failures, and provide designers with high-level modelling guidance. Our approach is based upon a classification of common modelling patterns. Combined with automatic proof-failure analysis, we use these patterns to automatically generate modelling guidance. Complementing this top-down process, we experimented with bottom-up AI theory formation techniques. Specifically, we explored how the HR automated theory formation system can be used to increase the flexibility of our modelling patterns. While our reasoned modelling ideas are generic, we focused upon the Event-B formal modelling notation and the associated Rodin tool-set.

It should be noted that BAE Systems (Warton) kindly contributed to the difference between home and overseas fees for the project student, i.e. Miss Maria Teresa Llano. The value of their contribution was &amp;pound;7K pa for 3 years. In addition, BAE Systems provided case study material and feedback on the project outcomes. BAE Systems was not part of the original proposal, but proved to be a very valuable partner, i.e. given that we could not recruit a suitable UK/EU project student, BAE enabled us to take on an excellent OS student.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our techniques support refinement style formal modelling at the level of system design. While developed within the context of Event-B, we believe that the essential ideas could be used within other refinement style formalisms.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F7CE97BB-7081-41EB-B75E-A9B7AFBF5415</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546241ade8ca84.74908873</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/remo/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E4BF2CD2-2BA6-4A34-A998-ABADC5139E6B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reasoned modelling critics: Turning failed proofs into modelling guidance</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science of Computer Programming</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ebcd9a7534ff4ffb99b58940a63ff222"><gtr:id>ebcd9a7534ff4ffb99b58940a63ff222</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ireland A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545c9793edf273.63406267</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F7BCF92D-9035-442A-96AC-D1A3D41EE9E6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Thinking Machines and the Philosophy of Computer Science - Concepts and Principles</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8810f72c438831d7af2deb84a004c080"><gtr:id>8810f72c438831d7af2deb84a004c080</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pease A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781616920142</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545cc5be8a6177.77458002</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F037058/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
