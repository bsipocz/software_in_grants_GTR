Typically datasets consists of observations (e.g. patients) on which a number of variables have been measured (e.g. height, weight). Whilst modern datasets can have many observations, the trend today is towards datasets with a very large number of variables. This is particularly true in genomics where scientific advances have allowed researchers to collect detailed genetic information on patients amounting to thousands or even hundreds of thousands of variables. More generally, automated data collection has given rise to so-called high-dimensional datasets across a variety of disciplines. For example, in healthcare analytics, aspects of a patient's history can give rise to datasets with a huge number of variables indicating what combinations of drugs were prescribed at particular times.

The field of high-dimensional statistics is a response to the challenges posed by these sorts of datasets which often render infeasible more traditional approaches designed for settings with only a handful of carefully chosen variables. Whilst much progress has been made, there remain several challenges, and this proposal will address some key outstanding methodological problems. Our methods will be applicable in a wide variety of settings, but two areas of application we will explore in collaboration are genomics and healthcare analytics. Our proposal consists of three projects which are described below.

Often along with the variables measured on a number of observations, we have an outcome or response of interest whose relationship with the variables we wish to learn from the data. In many cases, this relationship can be complex and depend on interactions between several groups of variables. Searching for combinations of variables which only together contribute to the response presents a serious computational challenge as the number of subsets of variables to search through quickly grows with the size of the subset. Even examining interacting pairs of variables can be computationally infeasible when the number of variables in the tens of thousands. A key contribution of our research will be to develop new methods that can scale efficiently to capture high order interactions in high-dimensional data.

Uncertainty quantification for high-dimensional data, for instance producing p-values quantifying the significance of variables in determining the response, is crucial in order to avoid deriving false conclusions from data. However research on this important topic is still in its infancy with many existing approaches often highly unstable in practical settings. Our proposal will develop new robust and computationally efficient methods for p-value construction and other forms of uncertainty quantification for a variety of models.

In some settings we do not have a distinguished response but rather would like to understand relationships between the variables themselves. Graphical models provide a useful way to model such dependencies but the available methods are often not scalable to the size of datasets now faced by many practitioners. We will use new computational techniques to develop randomised algorithms that avoid explicitly assessing each pair of variables to determine their relationship but can still deliver estimates of the strongest dependencies. The method will have broad applicability, but for example with biological data can help to learn the network of dependencies governing the underlying biological processes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>High-dimensional data are becoming increasingly more common across a range of scientific disciplines and industry sectors. This trend is set to continue with new technologies and automated data collection strategies enabling a greater number of measurements or properties to be recorded on each observation. Progress on the core methodological problems of interaction detection, nonparametric modelling and uncertainty quantification, which this proposal will tackle, therefore has the potential for wide impact. Software implementations of the methods we develop will be made publicly available to enable rapid deployment on real-world problems. In order to ensure the practical relevance of our research and usability of software, we will work closely with industry and academic partners. 

Among the sciences, genomics is perhaps the biggest consumer of methodology for high-dimensional data. As part of our proposal, we will apply our methods to a number of biological datasets in collaboration with Sylvia Richardson's group at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, with the aim of advancing understanding of cancer subtypes. In addition, work on detecting interactions between transcription factors in collaboration with Sumanta Basu at Cornell University will help to better understand the regulatory architecture of transcriptional machinery. These applications will also serve to disseminate our methods more widely to the genomics community, which faces a number of key challenges addressed by our work including the detection of gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions. In the long-term, improved understanding of biological processes, enabled in part by our new methodology, may help to guide future drug development.

More generally, there are a variety of academic disciplines routinely using high-dimensional statistics who stand to benefit from our research. For example, the PI's previous research in this area has been used in areas ranging from ecology to neuroscience, in addition to genomics.

Industry sectors where analysis of high-dimensional data is a familiar challenge include healthcare, e-commerce, finance and fraud detection, to name just a few. As a concrete example, the predictive analytics team at QuintilesIMS study datasets with large numbers of variables encoding detailed patient histories in order to find undiagnosed patients with rare diseases. By working closely with their team we will be able to tailor our research and software to meet their needs and guide the application of our methods to these problems. The improved predictive capabilities of the models will contribute to increasing the diagnosis rate among those suffering from these rare diseases.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100220</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R013381/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
