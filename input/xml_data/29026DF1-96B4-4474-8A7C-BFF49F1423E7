Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L023679/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Visual impairment is one of the most feared forms of medical disability, which imposes a great social and economic burden on our society. In the UK, the number of visually impaired people is almost 2 million, with total annual costs estimated over &amp;pound;13,000 million. Notably, age-related increase of visual impairment has been well-documented and is set to be on constant rise owing to the growing ageing population nowadays. Visual impairment has significant impact on quality of life (QoL), as reduced visual acuity seriously affect patients' daily and social activities, with substantial increase of risk of mortality, fracture and falls, depression and other emotional distress. 

A variety of responsive instruments for quantifying functional impairment related to vision have been developed. Also, there are well-recognised generic instruments for the assessment of QoL in general health terms. These instruments contain questionnaires referring to a broad range of physical, social and psychological aspects, offering the basis for establishing the QoL profiles of the individuals under concern.
Any changes in the QoL profile, for instance, the increase or drop of the level of physical and social activities before and after an eye surgery, can be used as important indicators for the outcome of the treatment. 

However, QoL assessment through written questionnaires has several significant drawbacks. Many answers often rely on participants' memory over a long period of time; people may read differently into the questions with their own interpretations; often there is no way of validating the truthfulness of many responses. These limitations raise serious questions on the reliability and validity of the measurements. 

Remarkably, the rapid advance of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology grants us opportunities to build QoL profiles of individuals with increased reliability and validity by monitoring their lifelogging data captured by a variety of IoT assets (namely object, sensors, mobile apps, web-objects, etc.) with constant connectivity and interaction in a pervasive network. MyLifeHub is such an attempt with focus on the interoperability of the IoT assets, aiming at a common, interoperable and internet-based environment for long-term lifestyle information for individuals. The system will keep users well informed about their daily activities, diet, sleep, mood, blood pressure, pulse, etc., enhancing self-awareness in health and encouraging positive attitudes towards lifestyles. Data sharing among different users will also be enabled to allow for experience exchange and to build healthcare social-networks among users. 

Especially, MyLifeHub will feature new techniques enabling simultaneously and long-term quantifying the functional impairment related to vision underpinned with smart glasses (e.g. Google-Glass), which provide wearable sensors to connect with the environment through RFID, infrared, Bluetooth or QR code, allowing for a constant monitoring of the behaviours of people's vision. 

MyLifeHub will be utilized as a platform to assess the impact of visual impairment on the QoL of ophthalmic patients both in general health terms and in vision specific terms. The research will be conducted &amp;quot;in the wild&amp;quot; through direct exposure to potential beneficiaries. Our clinical collaborator, Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH), is the largest eye hospital in the UK and earns a reputation worldwide. The outcome of MyLifeHub will be evaluated by the end users (namely MEH and its patients), allowing for the assessment and forecast of the transformational impact of the IoT technologies in real world terms.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>125230</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London Road Health Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MyLifeHub for Healthcare Research in Diabetes</gtr:description><gtr:id>3BBF286B-EAD7-4F66-9844-3813452D9D83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We expect joint publications and further large scale clinical trials.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5e423654062.81888452-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The clinical partners are using the MyLifeHub app (platform) to evaluate the impact of the technologies in diabetes self-management.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The clinical partners are using the MyLifeHub app (platform) to evaluate the impact of the technologies in diabetes self-management.

The system keeps users well informed about their daily activities, diet, sleep, mood, blood pressure, pulse rate, etc., enhancing self-awareness in health and encouraging positive attitudes towards lifestyles. Data sharing among different users is enabled to allow for experience exchange and to build healthcare social-networks among users. It features new techniques enabling simultaneously and long-term capturing the behaviour of individual citizens and patients, allowing for a constant monitoring of their behaviours. It is utilized as a platform to assess the impact of visual impairment on the Quality of Life (QoL) of ophthalmic patients both in general health terms and in vision specific terms.

The outcome of MyLifeHub is currently being evaluated by our clinical collaborator, Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) who is the largest eye hospital in the world, allowing for the assessment and forecast of the transformational impact of the IoT technologies in real world terms. Therefore, there is a strong partnership between the academia and healthcare professionals. 

Visual impairment imposes a great social and economic burden on individuals and society. MyLifeHub aims to develop a computing platform to build QoL profiles of individuals with increased reliability and validity by constantly monitoring their lifelogging data using IoT and intelligent data analysis technologies. This research aims at impact not only in ophthalmic care, but also in general healthcare by bring fundamental transform to healthcare, allowing for individualised risk prediction and treatment and raising self-awareness in health and encouraging positive attitudes towards healthy lifestyles. 

MyLifeHub has huge implications for patient self-monitoring healthcare in the UK, as it has the potential to change the way in which traditional healthcare is undertaken. The acceptance of this system by general research communities, hospitals and clinics will open opportunities for many hospital sectors, leading to reinforced synergy and leadership of the UK universities. The project is collaborating with our 3-year European project under 7th Framework called MyHealthAvata, which aims at solutions for the access, collection and sharing of long term and consistent personal health status through an integrated representation of &amp;quot;digital patient&amp;quot; in silico environment, allowing for the delivery of clinical analysis, prediction, prevention and treatment tailored to individual citizens. 

The platform is currently undergoing a clinical trial organised by MEH. Acquiring patient-based data for QoL assessment and Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) have been increasingly adopted as an important measure to estimate the impact of eye disease and to assess the effectiveness of ophthalmic treatment, for either individuals or groups of patients. This allows for comparison with other available alternatives, prioritisation and allocation of resource in ophthalmic care. 

This clinical study will examine 50 participants in either a single visit or number of visits over the course of up to 3 months. Participants who take devices away from the hospital setting for self-use will be invited back to return the devices so that the health data collated over the 3 month period can be analyzed using the technology developed associated with this award. The aim of the clinical study includes

? To assess feasibility of application of novel visual function and ophthalmic disease monitoring technologies in patients and ophthalmic care professionals
? To assess the impact of visual impairment on the Quality of Life of ophthalmic patients both in general health and vision specific terms. 
? To track the level of physical and social activities before and after eye surgery 

Self-reported activity and compliance data by patient including:

? Behavioural measurements.
? Patient-reported outcome and experience measures. 
? Visual function measurements.
? Clinical measures such as intraocular pressure.

The study consists of 3 methods of recruitment, by which a total of 50 participants will be recruited. The following sites will be recruiting: Bedford Hospital NHS Trust, Hinchingbrooke Healthcare NHS Trust, Ealing Hospital and Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Participants are recruited from sub-specialty clinics (Oculoplastics, Glaucoma, Cataract, Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic), and also from healthy volunteers (members of staff and from professional bodies) who will be invited along with patients from clinics to participate in Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) focus groups. During these PPI focus groups, participants will be invited to test, use or wear the selected technology from the sensors and devices. The technology used will then be correlated with appropriate Visual Functioning questionnaires. All completed questionnaires will be in a paper format and kept in the Investigator Site File, whereby the results will be transposed into a digital format. Participants will be given the specific devices for up to 3 months to wear and use. Depending on the nature of the participants visit to the Hospitals, they will then be asked to return for one or more extra visits. This will be timed for when a planned follow up appointment is booked; for example a Post-operative Cataract visit at 6 weeks, or Glaucoma follow up appointment. 

Feedback will be collated and assessed to see relevance of which form of technology is most helpful going forwards and what changes to existing software is needed to make it more clinically and patient friendly. Participants will be able to download the advanced new apps in order for their data to be submitted and tracked. The information from the tracking, such as heart rate, blood pressure amongst other forms of data that is generated will be extracted and analyzed using the technology developed associated with this award.

MyLifeHub has been integrated into our newly developed MyHealthAvatar platform, which has currently been under a trial by about 200 (healthy) participants European-wide. A number of workshops have been organised for the platform and technologies to be tried by the end users. We fully recognise that the best way of convincing the public to adopt the technology is to provide them with an opportunity to try it and see what performance benefits and the adoption of the project outcomes can bring. The platform is available at https://myhealthavatar.org/mha/. The app is available from the Google Play Store for free download and unlimited trial. 

Working together with our project partners, the technology/platform has been presented / demonstrated in a number of external and internal events, including conferences and workshops (i.e. the 12th IASTED International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (BioMed), February, 2016, at Austria; Medical image understanding and analysis (MIUA) conference organized by Lincoln in July 2015; ICT 2015, Lisbon, 20-10-2015 4 multi-part paper based evaluations, converted into David's digital version; the early diagnosis innovation workshop organized by CRUK in December, 2015; visits in Lincoln Hospital). Members of the team also conducted talks and workshops during lectures, research seminars and practical sessions to engage the students /researchers from a varying range of courses and disciplines. In addition, by working with MyHealthAvatar, the platform has been demonstrated and evaluated in a number of European countries. All the participants are encouraged to use the platform and we also provided the participant with the evaluation survey forms and related material and invited them to complete the surveys.</gtr:description><gtr:id>81AD8BB7-5DE9-449B-8937-607E7241EF18</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b538dfad92e9.73203382</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Overall the joint project is still continuing - Our academic partner, the University of Bedfordshire, has extended the project up to end of May 2016 due to the ethical procedures involved at Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH). Currently the technology is still going on trial by the medical staff and patients at MEH. 

However, by working with MyHealthAvatar, we have already made the following key achievements: 

The project provides a unique platform that empowers normal citizens in terms of supporting their life management and healthy lifestyles. Whereas in the past, the so-called 'grey area' patients with potential problems in health were not looked after by the health care system. As a citizen oriented platform, the platform provides services to the general public that help them identify and manage their risk of developing diseases. It is a perfect complement to the health care system. It offers a one-stop service for citizens in terms of data collection, and self-management services, such as monitor, record, and education. The system supports the storage of the behaviours and daily activities of citizen. It functions as a supportive environment to empower normal citizens in looking after their own health, raising their self-awareness of any potential risk of developing diseases while encouraging their healthy lifestyles in terms of doing routine daily exercise, stopping smoking and controlling their diet. In addition, we have incorporated tailored services, such as quality of life assessment ophthalmic care, which is used by the users access the impact of visual impairment to their life. 

Through this research funded project, we have developed an intelligent visual data analysis suite to support lifelogging data analysis collected from heterogeneous wearable sensors or mobile apps, to build Quality of Life (QoL) profiles of individuals, and to assess the impact of visual impairment on the QoL both in general health and vision specific terms. There are three new knowledge generated, which includes: 

? Develop a novel multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) hidden Markov model (HMM) as a supervised learning technique to predict human daily active states and monitor behaviour pattern from sequential life-logging data. We demonstrate that the new method performs accurately and effectively over range of sensor limitations and provides competitive results compared to one of the-state-of-art classifiers, with better generality and potential in healthcare setting. Some of this work has been recently presented in IASTED biomedical engineering conference 2016, at Austria. A full paper submitted to Artificial Intelligent in Medicine is currently under review.

? Transform a high-dimensional feature space into a new low-dimensional discrete class space using MOGP to construct an effective emission matrix for HMM model. The compact HMM helps improving the overall sequential learning performance.

? Model people's semantic behaviour in a semi-supervised learning scenario using a novel differential evolution hidden Markov model (DEHMM). Wearable sensors are used to collect people's daily activities (i.e. time, location, categories), which are then formatted in a sequential manner in hourly basis. The differential evolution, an evolutionary parametric optimisation technique, is employed to search for a (~close) global optima compared to the conventional expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, to improve the performance.

The technology developed in this project can make significant contribution to the following areas: 

? Assess the effectiveness of ophthalmic patient treatment by semi-automatically respond to Quality of Life (QOL) related questionnaires both in general health and vision specific terms with more reliability and validity. In the current ophthalmic clinical practice, a variety of responsive measures for quantifying functional impairment related to vision are used. The measures include questionnaires referring to a broad range of physical, social and psychological aspects, such as, VF-14, SF-12. The intelligent data analysis suite can overcome the limitations caused by the written questionnaires and provide a fast and accurate assessment of QoL. Examples include automated prediction of overall daily active scores and assessing night driving capability using sequential lifelogging data, such as walking steps, travel duration, distance. This will enable ophthalmologists to carry out reliable assessment of the QoL of eye patients, resulting in useful measures for the impact of eye diseases and for the effectiveness of treatments.

? Monitor individual's behaviour patterns (e.g. the level of physical and social activities before and after treatment) using daily activities data and diet, sleep, mood, blood pressure, pulse rate, etc, enhancing self-awareness in health and encouraging positive attitudes towards lifestyles.

? We also expect new research and outcomes from QoL assessment using lifelogging data, which will promote a high level of interest in healthcare research. 

During the lifetime of the project development, we have built a strong cross-disciplinary network with our academic partner, University of Bedfordshire, and Moorfields Eye Hospital, who provide key clinical input to the project from the perspective of ophthalmic care. The outcome of the project will be evaluated by the end users. MEH is currently recruiting 50 participants in either a single visit or number of visits over the course of up to 3 month. This will allow us to assess the transformational impact of the advanced technologies in real world terms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project results /key findings have been taken forward (disseminated) through both academic and non-academic routes, including:

a) Some of the key techniques findings have been presented in the international Association of Science and Technology for Development (IASTED) Biomedical Engineering Conference, in February 2016. 
 
b) Through our NHS partner, Moorfields eyes hospital, 50 participants will be recruited in either a single visit or number of visits over the course of up to 3 months. Participants who take devices (sensors) away from the hospital setting for self-use and will be invited back to return the devices so that the health data collated over the 3 month period can be extracted and analysed using the technology developed associated with this award. 

c) The technique findings discovered in this project has also been integrated into our newly developed MyHealthAvatar platform, which is funded by European 7th Framework. MyHealthAvatar aims at solutions for the access, collection and sharing of long term and consistent personal health status through an integrated representation of &amp;quot;digital patient&amp;quot; (to build up the entire concept of &amp;quot;digital patient&amp;quot; and provide solutions). The entire system can keep users well informed about their daily activities, diet, sleep, mood, blood pressure, pulse rate, etc. estimating/predicting overall daily active scoring, assessing the effectiveness of ophthalmic patient treatment by semi-automatically respond to Quality of Life (QOL) related questionnaires both in general health and vision specific terms with more reliability and validity, and monitoring individual's behaviour pattern, leading to enhancing self-awareness in health and encouraging positive attitudes towards lifestyles. 

Also, through our project partner, the University of Bedfordshire, a number of new research proposals or ideas have been put forward, which will make use of the platform. A brief summary of these proposals and ideas is given as follows: 
? For peer-support: The success of diabetes management depends on the ability of patients with diabetes to successfully sustain effective self-management behaviours, taking prescribed medications, following diet and exercise regimens, self-monitoring, and coping emotionally with the rigors of living with diabetes. MyLifeHub has been designed with inherent features to support self-management. A research proposal has been put forward to extend and evaluate the platform with respect to its capacity to support peer education among the communities for diabetes care. 

? For patients with memory problems: To help patients which start to have early sign of memory problems, doctors from memory clinics often help them with hints about their past experience with a purpose of stimulating their own memory. Since MyLieHub records the daily activities of individuals without requiring much of their efforts, it is seen potentially as an ideal tool used by the doctors and patients for the treatment of memory problems. Currently through the collaborator we are seeking a trial of the system by the patients in memory clinics. 

? For sport science: Research in sports science is interested in exploring the correlations between the activities and health (i.e. measured according to bio measures such as glucose, blood pressure). MyLifeHub may play such a role to support this research. 

? For Africa: To further exploit the outcome of this project, through our contacts in Nigeria, we have sent letters to the ministry of Health and Executive Governor for the expression of interest to conduct a short-term (12 months) feasibility study within a selected health organization in Nigeria, aiming at transferring the developed technologies to African countries in support of their local healthcare systems. 

- Study for eye patients at Hinchingbrooke Hospital. The aim of the clinical study includes: 

Study 1. Adherence with topical glaucoma medications in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension and effects of device interventions.
Study 2. Investigating the representativeness of a single clinic-based tonometry measurement of the intraocular pressure profile as measured with self-tonometry throughout the day.
Study 3: The relationship between activity, intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure in patients with pigment dispersion syndrome and pigmentary glaucoma.

- Diabetic study. 
This study will assess the feasibility of using the MyHealthAvatar mobile phone application to reduce prolonged sedentary behaviour and improve glucose control in Type 2 diabetes. Capability, opportunity, and motivation (COM-B) to reduce prolonged sedentary behaviour and monitor glucose levels will be assessed in addition to impact on cardiometabolic risk markers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1D0308D3-F1AC-40B6-B5C9-0A339F585DB8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b53cae8f5668.27709100</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://mylifehub.ccgv.org.uk/benefits.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A novel multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) hidden Markov model (HMM) to predict human daily active states from sequential life-logging data collected from different sources including wearable sensors, mobile apps.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BA474357-024E-49C6-A698-842181DD5CCD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The new method performs accurately and effectively over range of sensor limitations and provides competitive results compared to one of the-state-of-art classifiers, with better generality and potential in healthcare setting.
