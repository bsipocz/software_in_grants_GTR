Spaces</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M008495/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Across Europe, urban areas are growing and regenerating themselves according to a combination of individual self-interest and strategic planning. These are well-intentioned but the results are unpredictable. The multiplication of individually satisfactory developments and interventions may still be collectively sub-optimal, as seen in the case of urban sprawl, which is a potent spatial expression of modern society. In this age of complexity, participatory planning has been discussed in theory but only partly realised in practice, as it can lack the practical tools to harness the full potential of distributed decision-making. 

People are seen as being actively engaged in systems as participants, and as a consequence can contribute their considerable knowledge and expertise to systems of placemaking.

Incubators address ways to harness the new technological possibilities and integrate them within multi-level planning systems to assist distributed decision-making in the self-organisation of places. The Project advances these challenges by linking a unique urban co-creative software, to e-participatory engagement applications and crowdfunding tools, involving co-creation in the making of public places by and for people. In this way, public spaces are transformed from empty spaces into a real context for social interaction, and would then become defined not only by the architecture that contains them, but also by the actions of the people that inhabit them.

The Incubators of Public Places provide the means to reconnect people with places and placemaking. What makes a place is the integration of spatial forms, built and open, that favours the interactions of people as they inhabit those spaces. In an Incubator, you can go online or join a public meeting, to shape easily your own scenario for the place, with clear and simple 3D models of spaces - as you would expect to be: flying through and walking around, exploring and making changes. Then, crowdfund the scenario, to provide your support, revamping the city as enjoyably as buying a book online.

The project will bring together innovative design software, communication software and software for facilitating 'crowdsourcing' and 'crowdfunding'- allowing citizens to be involved in the design of their public spaces interactively. The project is an exercise in applied research and allows 'live' experimentation and testing, with outcomes that can influence the design of public spaces in the cities involved. The project will also include a critical interpretation of the on-site applications, with implications for advancing social science and urban theory as well as application for future design and planning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Project engages academics, policy makers, business, civic society stakeholders and citizens in multi-level planning systems to assist distributed decision-making in the self-organisation of places mediated by technology. The Project will link placemaking co-creative software to e-participatory engagement applications and crowdfunding tools. It directs community participation toward the improvement in the wellbeing of local residents and the public spaces in which they live and use. The project is expected to have impact (i) during its execution (software tool creation and testing) and (ii) during the platform's future use. In (i) stakeholder participants will gain knowledge and experience which has reputational, policy, academic and business value. We expect the following four types of stakeholders (users) to be involved in stage (i): (1)People (i.e. citizens who want to solve their real-life problems in Brussels, London and Turin as well as participants of the virtual case studies), (2)Utilizers (enterprises that want to develop their business in the area), (3)Enablers (public-sector actors, developers, e.g. LB of Wandsworth, GLA), (4)Providers (domain experts, e.g. universities, consultants, technicians like BRAL, LAQ-TIP Lab, ISN GmbH). Insofar as stage (ii) is concerned the platform involves in the co-creative process: (a) decision-makers and local administration, who develop strategies, policies, plans, codes, ordinances etc (b) local communities, organisations and citizens (c) real estate developers and construction companies, (d) planners, architects, technicians, and other practitioners, who provide the decision makers' work with expertise, and translate the general outlines of the strategies in sharable physical scenarios and operating procedures. (e) small economic activities owners and large firms or companies managers, who bring their own plans and perspectives on an area. The platform will support the self-organisation of places, enhancing the factors that motivate and enable actors to reach common understandings and to coordinate actions by reasoned argument, consensus and cooperation rather than by top-down actions only. The identification of the benefits that can be achieved collectively, e.g. functional and attractive public spaces, sustainable mobility, can facilitate plans and actions to achieve those benefits, and contribute to a sense of ownership for places and neighbourhoods by their population. Therefore all groups will benefit from insights into how placemaking projects can be delivered more effectively and efficiently, into the challenges such projects pose and into how policy can assist in achieving better planned and more equitable places. This exposure will strengthen (a) and (d) evaluation capacity, will deepen the understanding of placemaking project delivery for those actors and will therefore improve the chances of success of future projects. Organisations in group (c) and (d) will benefit from refining their ideas and making their expertise more relevant commercially. Organisations and actors in group (b) and (e) will benefit not only from making their point of view heard but also from gaining insights into the inner workings of the governance mechanisms and processes which are called to deliver such projects. Academic and non-academic benefits will be realised in the short term (changes in perceptions, knowledge exchange) and in the medium term (future research agendas, methodologies and policy approaches). Benefits such as the increased transparency of policy making, the more effective placemaking delivery process or the commercialisation of the know-how accumulated may take several years to impact fully. The project management and research teams (PI, Co-Is, Researchers) will improve their transferable skills in team building, effective communication, time management and report writing.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151789</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Turin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Vincenzo Lombardo</gtr:description><gtr:id>2CB32EBC-BB0F-42D7-88B0-58EA6EC50079</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is multi-disciplinary - the disciplines are broadly speaking, computer science, architecture and planning</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d979e72b7952.10471743-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Knowledge exchange as part of the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Knowledge exchange as part of the project.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Exchange</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>621E7B5E-62CF-46FC-A4C7-29C4ECCC2C5B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research exchange - exchange of research knowledge, via a face to face engagement format.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b4e7e65e3c52.60963454</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organisation towards Incubators Conference (April 2017)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AE0D39A6-F92F-4D37-96CD-7284FFD502B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At the present stage, our involvement has been on the scientific committee for this conference due to take place in Brussels in April 2017.
