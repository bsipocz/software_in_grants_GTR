Connecting communities with and through responses to interdependent, multiple water issues</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008165/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>We aim to investigate and develop what we are calling hydrocitizenship:- the extent to which hydrocitizenship is emerging in local areas and how it can be enhanced by arts and humanities centred interdisciplinary research (AHIR) conducted with community groups. Hydrocitizenship implies an awareness of, and responsibility for, water as a vital social and environmental resource at both the individual (citizen) and community level. Being a 'hydrocitizen' means recognizing the complex and interconnected nature of water issues in modern society; that choices and conflicts arise from the differing demands we put on water resources; and that climate change presents added sets of challenges to future water resilience. We seek to move beyond single issue foci of water (e.g. flooding, drought, water supply security, waste disposal security, water related biodiversity, water as amenity and cultural asset) to a more holistic approach which sees these issues as interdependent and operating in catchment and engineered systems which connect communities in numerous way (upstream, downstream, across the rural urban divide, across local and even national legislative boundaries). At the same time as addressing these water-community issues we will ask a series of questions about what (local) communities are (networks/place based); how they are formed/practiced 'internally'; how they are connected to other communities around them, and if, through thinking about environmental (water) based resources communities inevitably share (and are sometimes in conflict over), we can contribute to community and environmental resilience in interconnected ways. The detailed aims are to

identify and study how local communities (and other agencies) are re-assessing their relationships with water assets and issues

help enhance (or establish) local community connections to local water assets and issues
consider water in a holistic, joined up way, rather than in a series of single issues (such as flooding, supply security, pollution)

use water as a means of rethinking how local communities are formed and practiced

consider how thinking about various water networks and issues, connect differing communities; for example up and down stream, conflicting uses of water course

seek win-win synergies through addressing community/social challenges and environmental challenges in tandem 

place the above in national and local water focused policy initiatives

reflect upon and share how arts based interdisciplinary participatory research with communities can make a significant impact in key social-environmental challenges 

A matrix of activities will take place across four study areas in England and wales. The overall academic team of 15 researchers from 9 universities will work with selected arts practitioners and community groups to conduct a series of participatory research project elements which will include performance, film, historical narratives. The exact form and direction of the activities will be the outcome of the preparatory co-working conducted with arts consultant and community partners. The interdisciplinary academic research linked to these elements will not only bring approaches and methods from related social science disciplines but aloes allow the research to be relevant in a range of disciplines and policy arenas.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this work will be significant and channeled through five user communities. 1. Local communities. In each research site we will enable co-design and knowledge exchange opportunities with participating groups such as the Brislington Community Partnership (Bristol), Canal Connections (Shipley), Ecodyfi (Borth), and the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority and the London Legacy Development Corp (Lee Valley). We will study and enhance the efforts of these and other groups to make local impacts on socio-environment challenges. We expect the project to make direct impacts on the daily experience and practices of non-affiliated individuals in each of these community areas. Our programme of arts-led, participatory research will enhance cultural experiences within these environments, promote environmental awareness and strengthen community cohesion and improve social welfare through engagement in critical water-related issues. For example, in Shipley, our work with Canal Connections will support the involvement of disadvantaged youth in canal boating - providing positive, skill-developing experiences in water contexts. 2. International academic users. We expect broad academic interest across a number of disciplines in the arts and humanities, social and physical sciences inc. human and cultural geography, physical geography, urban studies and community development, environmental politics, history, performance, film and media studies (among others). Academic dissemination will be through: 1 book; at least 7 major peer-review papers in high impact journals (geography; performance research, hydrological governance, material culture, co-design, community studies) and other outputs. We will engage with national and international academic audiences through seminars, publications and participation in national and international conferences. 3. This work will be relevant to policy/governance users in relation to water resilience/governance including national organisations such as the Environment Agency, Natural Resources Wales, the Landscape Institute, the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management and regional water providers such as Wessex Water (Bristol). Additional beneficiaries include key national research and governance programmes such as Living with Environmental Change, (LWEC); DEFRA (Making Space for Water); UK Droughts and Water Scarcity programme, National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA), UK Water Research and Innovation Framework, EA catchment flood management. Other public sector beneficiaries will include civil servants, politicians and policy-makers at local and national tiers of government.. 4. Policy/governanceusers in relation to community resilience/governance; this work will also be relevant to organizations and bodies (public, private and quasi-) seeking to develop community resilience in the face of the multiple social, economic and cultural challenges faced by communities in rural and urban settings. Dissemination/impact maximisation will be through a series of KE project reports, online resources and active dissemination though networks. 5; arts and humanities practitioners who work with communities on eco-social transitions, resilience and sustainability. There is an increasing trend of artists positioning themselves as mediators and catalysts at the interface of environmental, social challenges, science, and community engagements. The methodologies and outcomes of this project will be significant exemplars of multi-partner working of this type. Reports and on-line information will make the working processes, lessons learnt and outcomes freely available to this community. The structures of the strategic stakeholder group and 4 area stakeholder groups serves not only to advise the project but also as key channels of dissemination and impact to a range of key agencies such as LWEC, Environment Agency, Local Water Companies, Local Authorities.

This film emerges in response to community development work undertaken at Crosley Wood by Shipley's Kirkgate Centre, and supported by Multi-Story Water. The film focuses on the story of just one family on the estate, and uses water as a connecting thread, looking at the Mynards' pro-active response to the Boxing Day floods of 2015, their feelings about the canal, and - most importantly - at the their housing conditions. Plagued by damp and internal floods, the family is at the mercy of a housing authority (InCommunities) which has shown little concern for their plight. Unfortunately, their story is just one of many like it.

The 15-minute film was shot in late summer of 2016 and premiered in a public screening at Kirkgate Centre's AGM on Saturday 19th Novermber.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6A06495C-632B-4502-9F03-0455966B3863</gtr:id><gtr:impact>51 views 1 like on YouTube</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd75d4e3e3c7.25558675</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>High Rise Damp</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://multi-story-shipley.co.uk/?page_id=1812</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This film of After the Flood presents a camera-friendly version of the live, promenade performance (of the same title), created for Leeds Waterfront Festival, in June 2016. This was a co-production between Multi-Story Water and the Leeds-based company, Common Chorus Theatre, which sought to respond to the major flood that hit Leeds on Boxing Day, 2015. (For further details on the making and context of the live show, see under our &amp;quot;Performances&amp;quot; tab.)

In the live version, small groups of spectators were invited to embark on a looping walk around a section of the River Aire in Leeds city centre, starting and finishing at Granary Wharf. Our actors, stationed at points around the loop, would perform their scene afresh for each new group that came past. In the same spirit, the show's six scenes are presented below as six separate videos, for you to &amp;quot;navigate&amp;quot; in sequence.

Thanks for writing this Steve, I enjoyed the opening and your performance in particular. The personal stories you told prompted a thought. This may be no more than a semantic distinction but I often feel that 'the authorities' (and I have been in that position myself, so am suddenly recognising a past failing) find themselves responding to episodes such as this by addressing 'the flooding' or (in my case) 'the contamination incident' rather than the effects of the incident on the individuals (not 'the people') affected.
We must be much more aware of those human impacts - it's not the flooding that matters but the very real effects on those who are flooded.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd7dd89c51a0.33530797</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>After the Flood (2016) Performance</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://multi-story-shipley.co.uk/?p=1830</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>During winter/spring Jo Munton, an experienced puppeteer and choreographer of interactive youth theatre, will work with colleague Owen Glynne Davies at the schools at Tal-y-bont and Borth to produce Hydroscope.

LabSpace, Harbourside 21st and 22nd of February 2015.

On the weekend of the 21st and 22nd of February Water City Bristol and Bristol Loves Tides (A Bristol Green Capital Project) were invited by Bristol Green Capital event curator Anna Farthing to put on interactive exhibition in the Green Capital Lab Space on Bristol Harbourside. The purpose was to populated the space with a series of linked exhibits about water, energy, ecology, history, place and landscape for the weekend.

The room was also shared by the Marine Conservation Society and Bristol City Council with a range of displays about marine ecology, marine pollution, tidal energy possibilities on the Severn Estuary, as well as the focus on Bristol's tides past and present.

The room was set out with a number of interactive displays, information boards and a series of screens. Water City Bristol / Bristol Loves Tides also had a table of book exhibits and a large white model of a Severn Pilot cutter on which members of the public were invited to write comments upon. This was used as a spur to generate conversations about Bristol's tidal past,present and future, wider water issues, and ecological issues beyond that.

The event was also used as an opportunity to publicise the next Water City Bristol / Bristol Loves Tides event to be held in another part of the docks on March 22nd. It also coincided with the nearby art installation &amp;quot;Smoke Bridge&amp;quot;.
The Water City Bristol / Bristol Loves Tides staff on duty were Professor Owain Jones; (PI on Towards Hydrocitizenship project); Antony Lyon (NOVA) (Project Consultants on Towards Hydrocitizenship); Warwick Morton (shipwright and associate of My Future My Choice); Hugh Thomas (Director My Future My Choice).Volunteers for Bristol Green Capital Staff also took part.

Over the two days there was a steady walk through of people and it is estimated 210 people interacted with the displays and entered into conversations with the volunteers. Numerous comments where written on the 'white boat', all of which were captured as an image, and some of which were tweeted as pictures. This boat will be used in further displays and activities.
The participants ranged widely in age and other demographic categories and were variously local Bristol residents, tourists visiting Bristol, and students studying in Bristol.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E9B58A9-5BE1-4C14-8190-76AC00F9E262</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increased awareness of future events for the Bristol Green Capital project Bristol Loves Tides.

The idea is to create an outdoor corridor gallery along the high street in Borth, by projecting footage which explores the effects of sea-level rise on communities across the world. The project will involve local residents, including the people who live in the houses on the street and those who have been involved with the Borth flood defence schemes.

&amp;quot;We want to draw parallels between flooding and climate migration here in the UK and globally, creating lots of difficult but necessary conversations about the different scales of the disaster, the cause, the implications, etc. These are transferable as they relate to other towns in similar situations as flooding worsens across the UK and the world&amp;quot;.


Water Water Everywhere (part 1)

We are a group of artists interested in flooding induced migration, a topic affecting both us, here on the coast of Wales, and communities globally in places like Kirobas in the Islands of the South Pacific. 

We have designed three events to get people talking about Borth, flooding and the future.

Our first Water Water Everywhere event took place on the beach in Borth on the 26th August. Led by Anne and Bodge, holiday makers and other beach-goers made the town of Borth out of sand and found objects until the incoming tide washed the town into the sea.
While crafting and playing we talked about Borth, flooding, storms, the sea defences and asked participants to imagine what will happen to the sea side town in the future, when the sea defences have stopped working.

Video interviews from this workshop will coming up in next next posts... along with more information about the next two events...

The other participants include: Tom Gunn (fine art photographer), Alex Randall (Climate Outreach Information Network), Helen Kennedy, Anne Ferris, and Bodge (all community arts practitioners),</gtr:description><gtr:id>D055474A-68CC-4456-B97A-F2BAD03B445A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TBC</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e01c7524dc01.30101874</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Hydrocitizenhip Borth Case Study Water, Water Everywhere Esther Tew</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cymerau.org/newyddion--news/water-water-everywhere-part-1</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Boz Groden will be commissioned to make Water Map, an activity that will continue through the year. As a result of conversations with people who have a variety of interests and concerns with water in the Borth/Cors Fochno part of the study area, Boz will create a 'hard copy' map by drawing humorous illustrations that will record the places and issues discussed. His work will also have an interactive element by involving online exchange of ideas and images.

&amp;quot;It deals with source and use of water and wider community engagement with its value, threat and future use to ourselves and others.

FRom blog report

The evening began at the Planetarium where we were treated to a very large and curved showing of the first Proxi and Peri film, depicting their arrival into Bristol at the beginning of the Green Capital year. About 80 people were in attendance at this ticketed event, many of whom had been at the first event in March. The crowd included young and old, a variety of people who had an interest in some way, in Bristol's tidal nature and history. 

Picture
The Planetarium show included, as might be expected, segments of 3D animated demonstrations of the planets of our solar system in relationship with each other. At the risk of sounding like a voiceover on a cheesy children's TV programme, we travelled through time and space, zooming in on a map of the South West of England with the Severn Estuary and the Avon leading into Bristol, viewing the solar eclipse of March 20th of this year from the perspective of Ashton Court, and later zooming all the way out to view the planets in Syzygy of the earth, sun and moon, both in March and a couple of days ago again. It was fascinating to see these views, and gave a real sense of our beautiful planet, its beautiful moon and the solar system we are in. 


We then watched a film made at the Syzygy event in March, at which many of the audience would have been present. It was interesting to watch us all taking the oath, not knowing yet what we'd be swearing to do. I wonder how many have given up bottled water since! With RefillBristol now taking off in our fair city, perhaps many more will be inspired to do so.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4BD278E3-8EA1-48B7-81A8-543478AA8F1F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Positive audience response</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e050a72d2078.01770137</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Hydrocitizenship Bristol Case Study event for Bristol Green Capital 2015 Blood Moon Peri and Proxi Performance</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.watercitybristol.org/blog/blood-moon-high-tides-and-proxi-and-peri-head-back-to-sea-reflections</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Interview from Water Water Everywhere project 3</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B19515A-745E-4420-B905-8949D72467E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TBC</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e1605ad7fe36.41109176</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Filmed Interview from Water Water Everywhere project 3</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frKKsrI1Ebk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Hydrocitizenship Shipley Case Study participated in this vibrant, well-established street fair.

The film has screened at the following public events as part of the 'Being Human' festival (supported by the AHRC): Burdall's Yard, Bath Spa. November 19th, 2016; Aberystwyth Arts Centre, November 25th, 2016; Borth, The Friendship Inn, November 25th, 2016. It was also screened at a 'Past Matters, Research Futures' academic conference, on 12/13 December 2016 at the Royal Society, showcasing research under the AHRC's 'Care for the Future' theme. TIMELINE was also featured in the Times Higher Education Magazine, and embedded on its website. This was part of a larger debate about the use of film in research. It was also embedded on 'The Conversation' online, under the heading 'five award-winning short films made by researchers that you should watch'. TIMELINE was also embedded on the blog 'Climate Crocs', by foremost climate blogger in the USA, Peter Sinclair, and described as a 'masterclass in visual storytelling'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7d6bc1ccd21.56803600</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>TIMELINE (30 min film)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/172669824</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>My Future My Choice</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hydrocitizenship Project - Bristol Case Study (Water City Bristol) My Future My Choice Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>63136B54-C7B9-4A7F-B4E7-86C926C74C10</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multi-disciplinary -</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc301613bea1.83127732-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>See above</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Bristol team of the Hydrocitizenship Project have worked very closely with My Future My Choice (MFMC) on a series of engagement activities and performances.

The Lee Valley Regional Park Authority (the Authority) is a statutory body responsible for managing and developing the 26 mile long, 10,000 acre linear Lee Valley Regional Park (Regional Park) - the only regional park serving London, Hertfordshire and Essex. The Authority has a broad and dynamic remit with a duty to develop and preserve leisure, recreation, sport and nature throughout the Regional Park. As part of this, the Authority is creating a zone of sporting excellence throughout the Regional Park which includes centres for athletics, horse riding, ice skating, sailing and golf.
 
As the owner of three London 2012 venues, the Authority is playing a leading role to deliver an enduring and sustainable legacy from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The 2012 venues are Lee Valley VeloPark, which has the iconic Velodrome at its heart and is the finest cycling hub in the world; Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre, with ten tennis courts (four indoor and six outdoor) and two of the finest hockey pitches in the country- both venues are located on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and Lee Valley White Water Centre at Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, the first 2012 venue to open to the public after the Games and the first to open before them. The Authority is also responsible for regenerating derelict and neglected land into high quality public open spaces and wildlife habitats of ecological importance, as well as preserving the region's historical value.

Hackney Wick &amp;amp; Fish Island area is one of the case study areas that the Lee Valley team focuses on. The neighbourhood forms part of the wider Olympic Park regeneration 'legacy' area and located around a network of rivers and canals, traditionally the transport route of east London's industrial and commercial goods, and today is home to a mix of canal boats and a network of towpaths for pedestrians and cyclists. 

Last CIG meeting was last Friday, 12th of September at 90 Main Yard, Hackney Wick. We have been attending the CIG meetings to engage with local residents and business and follow up the current issues and challenges in the neighbourhood since May. CIG meets Every 2nd Friday of the month at 9.30am at a rotating venue in Hackney Wick or Fish Island.

The Cultural Interest Group defines its role as to facilitate the conditions in Hackney Wick and Fish Island in which creative practitioners can develop their practice to become sustainable (http://hackneywick.org/about/). Each meeting follows up an agenda which includes current issues or developments in the neighbourhood. Post-Olympic developments, changes and/or evictions (in the case of E20 fishing club) are most of the time create heated discussions in the meetings. One of the most important developments that came up in the last meeting is the new local area plan produced by LLDC which are open for public consultation until October (http://queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/our-story/transforming-east-london/local-plan). The group questions if the consultation is a genuine attempt to take people's ideas on board or just to tick the boxes!

Also, the future of Hackney Wicked Art Festival (http://www.hackneywicked.co.uk/) seems to be blurry at the moment. Although the festival was great success this year, the committee struggles with the costs and this is risking the sustainability of the festival.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deeec657d518.16572111-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Access to events</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The project team have attended Hackney Wick Cultural Interest Group events and given out and gathered information of use to both partners</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Wessex Water</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hydrocitizenship Project Bristol Case Study Wessex Water Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>2E3E4D36-1166-4E15-847E-F2084CB681D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TBC but a lot of video of worker practice has been gathered by the arts group NOVA.

A series of short films about tides, estuaries and the coastline.

&amp;quot;Estuaries and shorelines hold a deep fascination for us - washed by the tides, they are constantly changing places of climate and light extremes, working to overlapping sets of rhythms and tempos, often alluring and sometimes dangerous&amp;quot;.

Guest presenter Professor Owain Jones of the Environmental Humanities Research Centre at Bath Spa University, and prime mover behind the Towards Hydrocitizenship project, has long been enthralled by tides and tidal cultures.

Tonight he introduces and discusses a collection of fascinating short films that explore our relationship with the ebb and flow of arguably the most powerful and transforming natural force on the planet.

Extracts from the project blog

The Hidden River Festival is an free annual waterside festival, giving local people a chance to enjoy a mix of live music, food stalls, art and fun for all the family with the aim of connecting the communities living alongside the New River, which runs through Hackney and Haringey.

Lee Valley Hydrocitizenship held a cultural mapping stall at the festival and engaged with the local people about their views and perceptions of this rapid changing neighbourhood.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c80951706007.92507958</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.leevalley.org/news/hidden-river-festival-woodberry-down</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tidal Festival; Shirehampton; Bristol</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C2614FC0-5E32-47B8-8A08-6D2D72A739F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Bristol Case Study team co-created a Tidal Festival with a local community group and environment group Friends of Lamplighters Marsh.

It was an opportunity for the children, involved artist, and local community members to share experiences and knowledge. Teachers of local schoolchildren reported that the children had been very excited to dress up for the occasion, and share their creative animation work.

The even was packed, to the extent that more people came than could physically fit into the space. Both films featured local people, including members of the public and/or artists that had participated in their creation in some way. There was also music by the band Whistler. There were vocal and public expression of enthusiasm towards the films, and very lively and spontaneous conversations for the whole evening on what it meant to live in Borth (so vulnerable to the sea, yet also thriving in many ways). There was feedback that the films naturally touched on huge and often-depressing global challenges, but that the effect overall was a celebration of place and community. There were many requests for future screenings and events, as well as enquiries about online links to the films and the two research projects ('Hydrocitizenship' and 'Troubled Waters') that were connected to each film.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c801d7a23998.97646869</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tidal Cultures Blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B7BBD256-AEC4-4311-A4E8-9A607E93B783</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a blog about Tidal Cultures.

The East End Canal Festival took place on Sunday June 26th at the Art Pavilion, Mile End Park. The event celebrated and promoted the canals as a community asset for the East End.
 
The turn out was great and people were very much interested in the activities and exhibition. The Festival builds on the work of the East End Canal Heritage Project, run by Laburnum Boat Club and supported by funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The Festival showcased the project's work uncovering the stories and images of the Regent's and Hertford Union Canals over the last almost 200 years, which was moving and interesting. Activities including boat trips, workshops, art exhibition and stalls captured the interest of locals. Overall, it was a very good way to relax, learn and enjoy a sunny Sunday by the canal.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c80b74c46892.14844639</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.leevalley.org/news/-the-east-end-canal-festival</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Wales Online article</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E6DFDF4-7BDF-431A-B6D5-3D2B4E276B25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BBC Wales online article relating the work of the Hydrocitizenship project in Wales and the recent flooding.

On the weekend of the 21st and 22nd of February Water City Bristol and Bristol Loves Tides (A Bristol Green Capital Project) were invited by Bristol Green Capital event curator Anna Farthing to put on interactive exhibition in the Green Capital Lab Space on Bristol Harbourside. The purpose was to populated the space with a series of linked exhibits about water, energy, ecology, history, place and landscape for the weekend.

The room was also shared by the Marine Conservation Society and Bristol City Council with a range of displays about marine ecology, marine pollution, tidal energy possibilities on the Severn Estuary, as well as the focus on Bristol's tides past and present.

The room was set out with a number of interactive displays, information boards and a series of screens. Water City Bristol / Bristol Loves Tides also had a table of book exhibits and a large white model of a Severn Pilot cutter on which members of the public were invited to write comments upon. This was used as a spur to generate conversations about Bristol's tidal past,present and future, wider water issues, and ecological issues beyond that.

The event was also used as an opportunity to publicise the next Water City Bristol / Bristol Loves Tides event to be held in another part of the docks on March 22nd. It also coincided with the nearby art installation &amp;quot;Smoke Bridge&amp;quot;.

The Water City Bristol / Bristol Loves Tides staff on duty were Professor Owain Jones; (PI on Towards Hydrocitizenship project); Antony Lyon (NOVA) (Project Consultants on Towards Hydrocitizenship); Warwick Morton (shipwright and associate of My Future My Choice); Hugh Thomas (Director My Future My Choice).Volunteer s for Bristol Green Capital Staff also took part.

Over the two days there was a steady walk through of people and it is estimated 210 people interacted with the displays and entered into conversations with the volunteers. Numerous comments where written on the 'white boat', all of which were captured as an image, and some of which were tweeted as pictures. This boat will be used in further displays and activities.

The participants ranged widely in age and other demographic categories and were variously local Bristol residents, tourists visiting Bristol, and students studying in Bristol.

One of the research stands of Hydrocitizenship - Water City Bristol is trying to a) explore the 'hidden', 'lost' tidal cultures of the city (cultures being both ecological and social) and b) seek to get Bristol to see itself as water/tidal city by bringing this hidden / lost tidal cultures, and related water histories, assets and challenges back into the public realm/imagination.

Come and chat to the Hydrocitizenship team outside the House Mill, Three Mills during National Mills Weekend (14-15 May 2016) to share your experiences and ideas about living, working and relaxing near the Three Mills and River Lee.

Also, find out more about the Active Energy project where the outflow from part of the Three Mills heritage site will be utilized to drive a slow moving stream wheel. This will generate sufficient power for an aerator that will help oxygenate the water to counteract the effects of pollution and support the survival of fish.

Memories and thought about tides were captured on a map and on large white cardboard model boats. A flotilla of these boats made and decorated by school children sailed acres the harbour as part of the water-based displays. Bristol Harbourside Festival is a very large community event with over 30,000 visitors

This happened on World Water Day at the Centre for Alternative Technology, Machynlleth (May 2015).

The festival was great success thanks to organisers and volunteers. The range of activities and stalls kept the festival ground busy all day long. Lee Valley-Hydrocitizenship team hosted a cultural mapping stall during the festival. Hydrocitizenship stall was one of the liveliest areas of festival along with London Wildlife Trust, Love the Lea/Thames 21 and Thames Water. More than 20 people took part in the cultural mapping study and shared their experiences and ideas about living around Firs Farm. Thanks to Luciana Alves (PhD student at the Department of Natural Science, Middlesex University) for her help during day.

This was a day of planned activities to mark World Water Day 2015 co-produced by the Hydrocitizenship Project and the Bristol Green Capital 2015 Project Bristol Loves Tides? This project and the day have the aim of raising public awareness of, and participation in Bristol's natural and cultural tidal heritage. Bristol has the second highest tides in the world and the past, present and future tidal cultures of the city are significant. They include histories of trade and slavery, ecology, and future of flood risk, green energy etc. The day consisted of shared breakfast at a dock-side caf&amp;eacute;, a performance and oath by characters devised with a number of partners (below) and delivered by Desperate Men Theatre Company; (filmed); to coincide with one of the highest tides of the year; a boat trip up the docks; a film showing on historic steamship the Balmoral. 12 'Young Presenters' - young people selected for in-project media training - took part in the events. Photos and film online.

This was a 'Learning Ships' boat trip out of Bristol Harbour and onto the tidal river following the movement of an historic steam ship. A group of 6th form students we invited on the trip and heard a series of talks by Professor Jones and others about Bristol's tidal heritage. A photographic record is at https://www.flickr.com/photos/129343245@N07/albums/72157664877350349. The trip was also filmed and is on-line.
Learning Ships focuses on the heritage and future of Bristol's tidal regions.

Activities included singing by the local choir on the beach, and the launch of a huge 'Sea Urchins' into the sea by artist Jenny Hall and collaborators. There was a driftwood workshop, folk music, and a presentation by the Cymerau team. Several thousand people have viewed the subsequent photographs shared on the project's Facebook site (and were 'reached' in this way). The purpose of the activity was to draw attention to the project, and involve a many locals as possible. There was coverage in the local newspaper. It was also an enactment or performance of 'community' and water, in and of itself.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0c44be2cf11.76908878</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.hydrocitizens.com/blogs/item/cymerau-launch-in-pictures</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>37733</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Research Network Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/N005767/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>9F6D2528-B167-4949-8406-E9D663F510AC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56de9e00acc9c6.78639031</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Connected Communities 'Community Futures &amp;amp; Utopia' Festival 2016</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0454BA93-16EE-4847-BB10-FCD8C95EBD68</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e1818d03d225.18392148</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Lottery Heritage Fund</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Big Lottery Fund</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>543790EF-4D75-4C30-86CC-9481F408BC80</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e17ba89afa31.93881060</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>7800</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Connected Communities Festival 2015</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E472BDB6-AB48-4071-84E7-8390DFDC418B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e180a07ca413.17439786</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>8000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Connected Communities Festival in 2015: Hydrocitizens and Power and the Water Projects</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1FF70D79-4F33-4732-A31A-1DC25B2908C0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cda4c9da51d8.50726467</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have a number of non-academic partner active in this large Arts and Humanities Research Council Connected Communities project.

From an email 

&amp;quot;I was really inspired by your talk on Friday . I've spent some time exploring the hydrocitizens hub - what a brilliant platform! So, I was wondering whether you could put me in contact with the people that have designed the website? I'm part of an international permaculture/forest garden network and we are currently investigating setting up an online tool and it would be great to have something very similar to hydrocitizens.com.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd4e453646e9.50683016</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Professor Jones Invited by RSPB and National Trust to present evidence on using arts based methods for a proposed large coastal heritage project.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FCE398B9-BA6A-4FDA-99B3-184A35E70BE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PI Professor Jones was invited by a joint team of the RSPB and National Trust to advise on arts based methods for a new large project they are planning on coastal heritage conservation and working with communities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd25d2513ba7.57409364</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Hydrocitizenship project principles taken up by Wye Valley AONB 2016 and 2018 Festivals</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>16A6CC46-512A-47BD-944B-F4E8BDD716CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Key principles developed in the 'Towards Hydrocitizenship' project were taken up by the Wye River Festival 2016. This is a large 2 week event which is a major element of the Wye Valley AONB's strategy for public engagement and awareness raising. The festival focused on multiple water issues and Professor Jones acted as a academic advisor in the development process of the festival and wrote a short essay for the festival programme - a free booklet - 15,000 copies distributed. Professor Jones is also advising on the development of the 2018 Festival (they are biennial)

From the 2017 Festival evaluation 

&amp;quot;WVRF2016 encompassed 28 events, at 28 venues on sites from Hereford to Chepstow.
We exceeded all our targets: Achieving 29,800+people attending events. 1,200 school children were involved in our workshop programme. In addition 1,098 children had Wye Serai school visits with the Ensemble for half a day each.
539 young people worked with artists to create the flags which decorated the Festival sites. 
A further 300+ People participated in community training/workshops. 1000 origami birds were made by over200local people from a variety of community groups which were used in one of the installations. A whole community, young and old contributed to the other installation. 
328 people took part in the walking/story project.
220+ local singers, musicians and performers were involved in the performances 
250+torchbearers were involved in the Llandogo procession with a further 
50 volunteer torchbearers involved throughout the Festival. 
In all 18 local youth theatre groups, choirs and bands took part in the performances.
