This proposal aims to offer a systematic approach towards a better understanding and prediction of the transition of sub- critical to super- critical injection phenomena, combining novel state of the art simulations with experiments already performed by the University of Brighton and Sandia National Laboratories for diesel engine conditions. The model will include real gas effects and target both primary and secondary atomization regions at the limit of transition between sub- critical to super- critical conditions. 
 
Such an approach is currently lacking from commercial and open source simulation tools. The new framework will be developed within Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and will be based on the extension of ideas also used in probabilistic modelling of flame interfaces (surface density approaches). The major strength of the approach is that it does not include any a priori region-dependent assumptions for the liquid-gas volume fraction in the computational cells, and bypasses the spherical vision of the liquid structures that compose the spray. Thus, it can be applicable both to the near-nozzle and the dilute spray areas, and represent both sharp (as in the case of sub- critical injection) and diffused (more representative of super-critical conditions) interfaces. 
 
Our suggested numerical models have the potential to capture the underlying physics of the phenomena even at extreme thermodynamic conditions and therefore can play the role of &amp;quot;virtual experiments&amp;quot;, providing valuable access to flow areas and conditions where real experiments face limitations. The numerical framework that will be presented in the proposed research aspires to lead to the creation of the new generation of equipment design tools that will be available to both academic and non-academic sectors and will facilitate the cost effective design of novel high pressure injection systems. Moreover, the outcomes of the research will be disseminated to the academic community through publications in high impact journals and national and international conferences as well as an outreach workshop. These could change the way we currently view the modelling of multiphase problems not only for automotive application but for other disciplines involving super-critical fluids.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The social, environmental and economic importance of maximising energy efficiency and minimising emissions from the use of liquid fuels in the power generation and transportation fields is significant. Using the RCUK Typology, this project has impact in the three fields shown below:

- Commercialisation &amp;amp; Exploitation: This project will take an innovative modelling approach to unveil the mechanism of the transition of sub to super-critical injection, pushing forward towards novel, energy efficient future engines. While seeking to unlock the physics of a very complex fluid dynamics problem at a fundamental research level, the proposal has been formulated to also address the current needs of the automotive industry. The code to be developed aims to model realistic pressure and temperature scenarios unsatisfactorily modelled by existing methodologies. A leading companies in the field, Ricardo UK Ltd, has indicated in their Letter of Support the various ways in which this project could impact their design and manufacturing process. Apart from the automotive sector, this proposal has the potential for a wider impact in various other fields that supercritical sprays are involved, since is expected that some of the results will be directly applicable to the modelling of other spray phenomena (e.g. aerosol sprays in medicine or agriculture).

- Environmental sustainability and improving social welfare:A large number of deaths are currently linked to air pollution according to the World Health Organisation. Moreover pollution and environmental degradation is negatively affecting people's overall quality of life. Considering that by some estimates, the total number of vehicles worldwide could reach 2.5 billion by 2050, the pressing need for improved fuel efficiency in order to keep carbon emissions within acceptable limits is clear. This project aims to make a significant contribution to the design of a new generation of computational tools resulting in a technology with the potential to reduce harmful engine emissions. 

- Evidence based policy making &amp;amp; influencing public policies: Pushing the technology frontiers in terms of engine manufacturing indirectly affects 
the way that policies are made. If the technology is available that allows minimum emissions then a greater pressure can be put to industries to reduce their emissions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0DF72E38-0EAF-4149-A430-C3D4044ED2D4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Simulation of micro-flow dynamics at low capillary numbers using adaptive interface compression</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Computers &amp; Fluids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7ccd4809f7b7b037f7d1cddf07d9fe19"><gtr:id>7ccd4809f7b7b037f7d1cddf07d9fe19</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Aboukhedr M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa3bc228de530.38075732</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P012744/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>53CC8ACD-11A0-48ED-8743-F66E9A657C12</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fluid Dynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
