All recent studies of the Syrian population in Turkey indicate that their status is gradually shifting from refugee to immigrant as a result of the prolonged conflict. While the Turkish government has maintained an 'open door' policy regarding refugees from their neighbouring country, they also were not prepared for the scale of the exodus or the length of the war. As a result, the Turkish government is currently struggling to formulate effective policies to deal with a crisis that threatens to impact both Turkey's future development and regional stability. 

Our project focuses on one of the most vulnerable groups within the refugee population: youth whose futures are being put on hold. Youth between 15 and 30 years of age would have attended university or entered the job market, but many are finding that their plans of education and training, or marrying and building a family, must be deferred. The project will assess their background, including educational level and skills; their educational, work, and health needs; and their visions of the future. We aim to develop concrete organisational and policy suggestions for social and economic integration show how Syrian youth in Turkey may be 
viewed not as burdensome 'guests' but as human capital that can contribute to the country's development. 

The project will assess delivery and access to services such as education and healthcare, and will employ a comparative and historical approach that takes lessons from other states' and from Turkey's own past responses to mass refugee emergencies. Moreover, we will map the various local, regional, national and international governmental, voluntary, and humanitarian organisations currently working in Turkey in order to understand how and why refugees use these organisations to access services. This will allow us to evaluate the government response and gaps left by that response. Two of our particular concerns are access to education and transition into the labour market, especially critical for the age group under study. The ability of refugee youth to access education will play a critical role in Turkey's immediate future, as it will determine whether or not Turkey will be able fully to make use of the human capital represented by this large, young population. Assuming that refugees are likely to remain in Turkey at least in the medium term, then, the project aims to improve access of refugee youth to education, health services, and the labour market in order to insure that this young population will contribute to Turkey's growth rather than become an impediment to its development.

This research is urgent, because the future of hundreds of thousands of Syrian youth is currently in danger. While a number of studies have attempted to assess integration problems and have warned of the immanent dangers of leaving them unaddressed, no study to date has systematically examined the critical age group that is transitioning from childhood to adulthood and currently making decisions that will shape their futures. This will also be the group that will play a critical role in decisions about return to the home country in future years. 

The project responds to a research gap regarding this humanitarian crisis, because the urgency and lack of data has so far dictated quick responses regarding populations that are constantly changing and whose needs are shifting. The thirty-month period of the RCUK-TUBITAK grant will provide research teams from two leading universities the opportunity systematically to collect and analyse data on the crisis and examine how those results may change over time, hence providing a base of reliable research data.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will aim to make urgent, medium-term, and longer-term policy interventions in a humanitarian crisis that has the potential to impact Turkey's future development and that is already threatening regional stability. The project studies Syrian refugee youth, a group that is especially vulnerable given curtailed access to education and language barriers in the labour market. We will aim to impact four main audiences: (1) the Syrian refugee youth population, which currently struggles to access education, health services, and the labour market in Turkey; (2) Turkish government agencies and non-governmental and humanitarian organisations whose work addresses the refugee youth population; (3) EU and UN policymakers, who are attempting to formulate appropriate policy strategies to address a growing crisis; (4) the UK and EU publics, which have limited reliable information about the refugee population.

We will achieve impact through a collaborative strategy that will build on the strengths and networks of the two research organisations (for details, please see Pathways to Impact). 

1. Research updates (press briefings)
Over the course of the 30-month grant period, we will have five press briefings regarding research results beginning in month 6 of the grant, when we expect to have initial findings of the structured and semi-structured interviews. Subsequent press briefings in months 12, 18, 24, and 30 will coincide with the workshops and conferences and/or the publication of research results as policy briefs and reports. Press briefings will take place in Turkey, while the LSE press office will aid in placing announcements of research results in the U.K. press.

2. Research reports
The research will result in four reports that will be presented in workshops and conferences organised by the partners and that will form the basis for two policy briefs. The report themes will be: (a) state-of-the-art report on policy responses and best practices regarding refugee youth (based on WP4) (b) access to and delivery of services to refugee youth (findings from WP1); (c) a gender-based assessment of well-being and needs (a comparative study from the findings of WP1, WP2); and (d) a human capital assessment and potential benefits to the receiving country (findings from WP2 and WP 3);

3. Two LSE workshops on refugee reception
A LSE workshop in month 9 will bring together NGOs and academics working on reception of refugees in Arab countries and the EU, especially Germany, with the LSE/MiReKoc research team for a discussion of preliminary research results and best practices. A second LSE workshop in month 22 will include a presentation of the first research report on access to services and will involve experts and NGO representatives from U.K. and EU migration receiving countries in a discussion of methods for improving access to services and integration.

4. Policy informing workshop in Ankara with government agencies, NGOs, and civil society
A policy informing workshop in Ankara (month 20) will present research results to date, as well as conclusions from the LSE workshops in a discussion of refugee integration and comparative best practices.

5. Policy briefs
Two English-language policy briefs in months 12 and 28 will be aimed specifically at making available research results on access to service and human capital assessment for an EU and international audience. These policy briefs will include recommendations on EU-level engagement and burden-sharing as a result of the two LSE workshops.

6. Two LSE-organised policy conferences
The research teams will present their policy recommendations at two policy conferences, to be held at the LSE and in Brussels and organised by the Institute for Global Affairs. 

7. Project website
A project website in English, Turkish, and Arabic will be essential to make research results easily available to wider publics both in Europe and in Turkey.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>253698</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P002455/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>743BED39-2B13-4A4A-A6DA-806AA3D5A4E7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography/Pop Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C2CCDE7A-FDDA-48B7-844D-0994BF0430D5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Globalism and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
