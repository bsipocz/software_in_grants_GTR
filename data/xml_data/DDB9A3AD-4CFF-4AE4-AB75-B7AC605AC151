This proposal will investigate whether antimicrobial resistance exists in Chlamydia trachomatis, which is the bacterium that causes the most common sexually transmitted infection in England &amp;amp; Wales. Chlamydial infection is also a considerable concern because it is found predominantly among young people between 16-24 years old and does not cause any symptoms in more than 70% of women and up to 50% in men. The infected individuals will, therefore, not know that they need to seek healthcare and go untreated and continue to transmit the infection to their sexual partners. Hence it has become widespread in the population, with approximately 10% of sexually active young people infected, in contrast to other sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhoea and syphilis which are found predominantly in high risk core groups. Chlamydia has serious consequences for women, causing complicated infection that can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy in later life. The government have recognised this as a priority and have funded a National Chlamydia Screening Programme which offers testing for C. trachomatis to young people attending healthcare settings, such as university clinics, contraceptive services and general practice. The infected individuals and their partners are treated with a single dose of the antimicrobial agent, azithromycin, and when the programme has completed its roll-out nationally in March 2007, large numbers will be receiving treatment. In addition approximately 100,000 patients with chlamydial infection are treated in specialised sexual health clinics in England &amp;amp; Wales with azithromycin or a five day course of doxycycline (tetracycline). There is a worry that extensive screening and testing for chlamydial infection treated with a single agent will select for resistant bacteria. Previously resistance has not been a problem for this organism but there are reports of patients with repeated and persistent infection that does not respond to antimicrobial therapy. This proposal is a scoping exercise to investigate whether resistance in C. trachomatis is a real problem. We will target patients who have persistent infection and will use microbiological and molecular methods to identify mechanisms of resistance. It is imperative that we have early warning of any possibility, that this very common infection, that is known to recur, will fail treatment. The outcomes of this proposal are important for maintaining sexual health in young people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Antimicrobial resistance and sexually transmitted infections are both global public health problems, and this proposal addresses both of these issues. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted infection and the major cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in England &amp;amp; Wales, with the serious long-term consequences of infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Chlamydial infection has become widespread in the community with the greatest burden of infection among young people between 16-24 years, in contrast to gonorrhoea which is more prevalent in high-risk groups. This has occurred largely because the infection does not produce symptoms in 75% of women and at least 50% of men, hence individuals do not access healthcare, and because diagnostic tests were inadequate until recent years. The government have recognised this as a priority to improve public health in the Sexual Health Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV, in the Health Select Committee Report and in the White Paper, ?Choosing Health?. The Department of Health have funded a National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP), following a pilot, to provide a multifaceted, evidence based and cost-effective national prevention and screening with a target to complete the national rollout in England by 2007. As part of the screening programme all infected individuals and their partners are treated with a single dose of azithromycin. The NCSP identified 9,786 infected young people in 2005/6 and the extensive use of a single therapy has raised concerns that this will select for resistance, as has been evident in other bacteria. In genitourinary medicine clinics chlamydial infection is also treated by a five day dose of doxycycline (tetracycline), with over 100,000 cases in 2005, and there have been increasing reports of individuals with persistent infection which does not respond to therapy. Detection of resistance has been difficult because of the absence of a definition of true clinical failure together with the lack of a standardised methodology for susceptibility testing. This proposal is a scoping exercise to address the question of whether antimicrobial resistance is present in C. trachomatis. The initial and crucial first step will be to identify patients with persistent infections that may be due to therapeutic failure by use of a detailed questionnaire. We will then use molecular and microbiological methods to investigate the possibility of resistance. This study should give an evidence base for antimicrobial resistance in C. trachomatis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>153109</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Reproducible and reliable methods for conducting MIC assays for C. trachomatis were developed.
