They enable both exciton and photon confinement in one direction. Strong exciton-photon coupling in these structures results in the formation of a new class of bosonic quasiparticles, described in terms of two-dimensional polaritons or mixed exciton photon states. Microcavity polaritons have favourable characteristics for the study of condensation phenomena and novel many body effects such as superfluidity in a solid-state system, which can be achieved at much higher temperature than that required for excitons and atoms due to their very small effective mass. An additional advantage of MC structures is that precise manipulation of the polariton states can be performed on a micrometer scale by an external laser field. In addition, strong polariton-polariton interactions enable the generation of non-classical states of photons. Also the internal structure of polariton states can be easily modified by the appropriate design of MC structures with resultant zero- or one- dimensional confinement. The key aim of my proposal will be accurately prepared macroscopically occupied high density polariton states with precise phase information and control of their polarisation and statistical properties. In order to prove the analogy with atomic condensates, but in a solid state system, one of the important parts of my proposal is dedicated to the study of spatial and temporal coherence of two interacting polariton condensates. Specially designed zero-dimensional photonic structures will also permit control of quantum fluctuations, which affect the coherence. Efficient generation of non-classical states of photons, squeezed light with polarisation selective control will be achieved using resonant excitation of the polariton ground states. Polaritonic states will be controlled by external applied uniaxial strain and applied magnetic field to achieve desired spin properties of polaritons and hence the polarisation of the polariton condensate. The proposed research will also focus on the study of interactions between the high density polariton phase and acoustic phonons, which will be important to understand new phenomena arising from condensation in the periodic potential induced by surface acoustic waves. Finally, the effects of squeezing and coherence properties of the polariton condensate will be investigated in wide band microcavities. The research is expected to lay a strong foundation for the future use of microcavity structures in quantum information technology and for the development of novel light sources, mixers and tunable optical filters.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>458861</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Paul Drude Institute for Solid State Electronics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Polariton condensation in Surface Acoustic Lattices</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C88DF27-3C97-4A1E-9065-966E9C956E85</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9728472b9728486-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>This work has been done in collaboration with the group of Prof. Paulo Santos from PDI, Berlin, Germany.

There are three major outcomes, which have a potential to be used in future applications. 

Firstly, we have observed bright polariton solitons in semiconductor microcavities. These solitons have well-defined shape and amplitude determined by the internal microcavity properties. They can be switched on and off on a ps timesclale and hence potentially can be used as optical bits for all optical digital processing schemes operating at Tbit/s rate. Real applications of these hybrid light-matter solitons can be realised in strongly coupled semiconductor microcavities based on GaN material, where microcavity polaritons may exists at 300 K and above.



Secondly, we were able to demonstrate efficient creation of coherent polariton states carrying Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM). OAM can be any integer and may represent a number of bits of information: vortices may thus have advantages over spins of photon for efficient use in quantum information technology. 



Finally, we were able to observe transition from spatially extended coherent polariton condensate into an array of localised polariton condensates by controllable application of the surface acoustic wave. In future we expect to realise quantum regime of such transition, where each of the localised polariton states contains only a single polariton emitting a single photon. Such an array of single photon emitters can be potentially used in development of quantum optical circuits to build powerful quantum optical computers.

In the longer term companies such as IBM, Oclaro, Nanoplus, Sharp etc potentially will benefit from the research conducted within this grant programme. Close interaction with some of these firms has been already established.</gtr:description><gtr:id>30BC3CCB-43F7-4DCC-A966-A9A23D53E60A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-3291561923.261324de24773e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In GaAs-based semiconductor microcavities strong coupling between photonic mode and exciton state (bound electron-hole pair) in quantum wells results in formation of hybrid light-matter particles described as microcavity polaritons. The important property of the polariton system is a strong optical nonlinearity arising from strong exchange polariton-polariton interactions due to admixture of the excitonic component. Such interactions, which are orders of magnitude stronger than those in weakly coupled systems, can be used potentially for development of novel optoelectronic devices performing all-optical processing. Furthermore, the small effective mass of polaritons arising from the steep photonic dispersion (and hence small density of polariton states) enables nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation to be achieved at relatively high temperatures (up to 50 K) and weak optical resonant or nonresonant excitation. Polariton condensates emit coherent light, which in combination with strong nonlinearity makes the polariton microcavity system attractive for building of new coherent light sources, frequency converters, switches and modulators.



The main beneficiaries from the research outcome of my grant are among academic communities, working on the development of novel optoelectronic devices, classical and quantum integrated active optical components for computational and telecommunication purposes. There are several major outcomes, which have a potential to be used in future applications. 



Firstly, we have observed bright polariton solitons in semiconductor microcavities. Solitons are nondiffracting nondispersive localised wavepackets, which are stabilised by strong optical nonlinearities. Polariton solitons are hybrid light-matter solitons, which are reported for the first time here. They have well-defined shape, small size (2-5 micrometers) and amplitude determined by the internal microcavity properties and pump conditions. Importantly, they propagate with a high speed of ~1.5microns/ps and can be switched on and off on a ps timescale. Because of such unique properties polariton solitons can be used potentially as optical bits in all optical digital processing schemes operating at Tbit/s rate. Real applications of these hybrid light-matter solitons can be realised in strongly coupled semiconductor microcavities based on GaN material, where microcavity polaritons may exists at 300 K and above. Recently, nonequilibrium BEC of polaritons has been reported in GaN-based microresonators.



Secondly, we were able to demonstrate the efficient creation of the coherent polariton states carrying Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM). OAM is represented by a phase vortex in polariton field, where the phase of a condensate winds around a point in space linearly with azimuthal angle. OAM can take integer positive or negative number and hence may represent a number of bits of information: vortices may thus have advantages over spins of photons for efficient use in quantum information technology. In our work we imprinted a phase vortex state on a polariton condensate using a steering optical beam carrying OAM. We also observed that pair polariton-polariton scattering from a pump state with no vortex to polariton condensate carrying the imprinted vortex results in a creation of an antivortex state in the idler condensate. Such vortices were shown to be metastable on a timescale of several hundreds picoseconds, which is much longer than polariton lifetime.



Thirdly, we investigated polariton condensates subject to periodical potential created by surface acoustic wave, which modulates both the energies of the exciton states and photonic mode. We were able to observe transition from spatially extended coherent polariton condensate into an array of localised polariton 1D condensates with increase of the amplitude of surface acoustic wave. In future we expect to realise quantum regime of such transition, where each of the localised polariton states contains only a few of even a single polariton. Such an array of strongly localised states will represent an array of identical single photon sources. This has a strong potential to be applied in quantum optical circuits performing quantum processing.



Finally, we investigated the first and the second order temporal coherence of polariton condensates in CdTe based microcavities. We observed that at high polariton densities polariton-polariton interactions tend to introduce some decoherence into the system. Nevertheless, such decoherence can be overcome at higher optical powers well above condensation threshold, when fluctuations of particle density occur on quite fast timescale. This research proves that polariton condensates can be used as coherent low threshold light sources despite strong interactions in the system.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research revealed several interesting phenomena, which can be further used for development of arrays of identical single photon sources and novel light sources emitting coherent straight or twisted light (with vortices). Polariton solitons form a foundation for building compact, energy efficient digital circuits performing all-optical signal processing on a fast picoseconds timescale. The potential beneficiaries are commercial companies working in optoelectronic industry and information and communication technology. We have been disseminating our results via publications in high profile high impact journals such as Phys.Rev.Letters, Nature family magazines etc read by broad scientific community. Several presentations at national/international conferences (ICPS, OECS, CLEO/QELS, MSS, EP2DS, PLMCN etc) and presentations and seminars in academic and industrial institutions were given. Our membership of the EU ITN Clermont4 with 14 partners, spread around 6 countries in Europe also provided ways of further effective dissemination and contacts with several industrial companies via research meetings.
