Glia performs a number of important functions such as insulation, nutritive support and maintenance of the right balance of signalling substances. These functions are essential to maintain an healthy nervous system throughout our lifetime and are often disrupted in many degenerative diseases of the nervous system and also in normal ageing.
Most studies on glial cell functions are conducted in laboratory animals like mice. Strategies for replacing or reducing animal experiments usually involve growing and manipulating cells in a dish. However because the function of glial cells is so intimately connected to its effect on neurons, these replacement strategies are less straightforward because it it is necessary to put together and manipulate two or more cell types (neurons and different kinds of glia).
We propose instead to replace mice with a small invertebrate organism, the fruitfly. This laboratory organism has glia in its nervous system and this glia performs all the functions found in humans. 
The fruitfly also contains an equivalent for about 70% of all genes known to be involved in human disease, it is economic and easy to maintain and manipulate, and has been widely used in many labs for over a century.
Our previous work has generated a genetic model for a rare human neurodegenerative condition in the fruitfly. This has shown dramatic deficits in glial cells, which shorten the lifespan of the fly and impair its movements. A sensible hypothesis is that malfunctioning glial cells do not interact properly with neurons and this compromises the function of the nervous system and reduces lifespan.
We propose to use our fly models as a tool for discovery to figure out the role of glia, and to identify those genes involved in the communication between glia and neurons that are essential for a healthy nervous system.
Whereas the specific pathology will be used as a convenient starting point, we have designed our project so that it can discover the mechanisms that guarantee a proper function of the nervous system in general. These findings may be considered also as targets for future pharmacological research that will exploit glia-neuron communication to improve the health of patients with neurodegenerative diseases.
If we are successful we will not need mice to study this issue in our lab and this will also encourage reducing the use of mice both in our lab and in other labs interested in these problems. It will be more interesting and straightforward to test whether what we find in flies is also true in mice, than starting a new investigation from the beginning in mouse. In the first case fewer animals will need to be used in experiments, because those experiments will not guided by suppositions, rather from the precise knowledge of how the same thing works in the fruitfly and therefore can be better planned.
In conclusion, our work is likely to be very important both for thinking about new ways to improve health in neurodegenerative conditions, and for reducing experiments on animals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Glial cells have evolved in close association with neurons in most sophisticated nervous systems and are essential for the development, proper functionality and maintenance of neuronal networks and of the whole nervous system. One of their key functions is to provide trophic support and buffering ability over time to neurons, which makes them a critical factor in homeostasis of the nervous system in ageing and for the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Importantly for the 3Rs, because glial cell function is inevitably linked to that of its impact on neuronal cells and circuits, traditional cell culture approaches as a way or replacing animal experiments are less straightforward. As a consequence, virtually all information about glial cells in neurodegeneration has come from mouse studies.
We plan instead to to exploit our Drosophila model for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and a collection of microRNAs transgenic strains as a tool for discovery, to shed light on glial function and glia-neuron interactions in neurodegeneration, and as a solution for promoting replacement, and encouraging reduction, of animal experiments.
Our specific aims are:
1.To identify miRs and targeted genes of relevance in glia for polyglutamine neurodegeneration.
2.To identify miRs and targeted genes of relevance in neurons for polyglutamine neurodegeneration driven in glial cells.
3.To study the mechanism of action of the top miR(s)&amp;gt;genes network in glia-neuron interactions. 
Although the paradigm we use is a rare human disease, our system is capable of identifying also general mechanisms that are relevant to any disease that involves glial malfunctioning and degeneration. In conclusion, in this project we will develop a research strategy of paramount importance for the 3R agenda, with a great potential for major findings in a key area of bio-medical research, of proven interest to biotechnological and pharmacological industry.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>316462</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/L000199/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
