&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Analysis of psychometric properties of the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) data from patients with depression. This will be done using existing datasets and analyses will be carried out using advanced statistical techniques.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Benchmarking - a rapid review of benchmarking using PROMs will be done. Benchmarking refers to the method of comparing the performance of routinely delivered service using the PROMs date with a view to identify possible best practices. Further statistical analyses will be carried out to identify particularities in the data from various PROMs and their implications for benchmarking.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Exploratory work with clinicians, users and managers to develop ways of presenting PROMs data. Routine use of PROMs data by clinicians and service users has received limited attention within academia and in practice. This work will consist of focus groups and continuous discussions at the Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Trust to ensure that PROMs data can assist clinicians in clinical decision-making, healthcare professionals in commissioning and other managerial duties and service users in the monitoring of their health.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Capacity building. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The fellow proposes to provide a series of workshops on health economics.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will be an important contribution in academia at regional, national and international levels . By its multi-disciplinary nature, it will be of interest to health economists, medical statisticians, researchers in mental health and clinical psychologists. 

It is expected that the general public accessing care will benefit from this research. One contribution of the research is to identify the best ways of presenting the data collected from PROMs to them. Ideally when receiving care, patients will have access to their own data and will be able to benchmark their 'progress' compared with others with similar health issues and undergoing similar treatments. First, by having access to their progress through PROMs data, patients may engage better with their treatments and can lead to closer interest in monitoring of their health which may, in turn, result to better outcomes. Outcomes from treatment will be compared between primary and secondary care wherever comparable. Second, this data may provide patients with information so that they have greater choice of where to be treated and potentially what treatments to opt for. Third, if the collection of PROMs is rolled out to all trusts, at a broader level, patients will be able to will to compare their outcomes with others throughout the country. Having an exact picture of one's care is necessary in improving health and well-being. 

Clinicians and healthcare managers will have access to PROMs data related to the care delivered, in a format that makes sense to them, which can help them in their clinical and managerial decisions respectively. For clinicians, this can be an important tool in shared decision-making where both clinicians and patients can use the data to provide the basis for discussing the progress and identifying potential treatments. Commissioners may also use the data from outcomes of their service users of their trust (and others when available) to assist them in making decisions in the context of world-class commissioning. It is expected that this research will encourage the Trust, as an organisation to make the most of its existing information infrastructure.

Trust staff will benefit directly through knowledge transfer and shared learning. The placement will help enhance the analytical skills of SHSC staff who will be able to carry on performing and using these analyses in the Trust after the placement concludes. The Trust will be in a position to build on the research to apply it to its day-to-day activities. SHSC is looking to enhance its research capacity and increase collaboration with ScHARR.

The Department of Health is also going to benefit from this research in the context of their national PROMs programme. While there has been significant development in the interpretation of PROMs data to compare providers, little work has been done on how data PROMs can be used in clinical decision-making. The research of benchmarking in mental health can be adapted and tested in other areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18370</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department of Health (DH)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Recovering Quality of Life - Development of a new generic PROM in mental health</gtr:description><gtr:id>5B0ED30D-0606-492F-94CA-009118AABDD5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The final output in the form of a new measure will be available in the summer of 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460d4867169d1.17388169-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Department of Health has put us in touch with the relevant sections within the Department of Health that have an interest in such a measure.

It has led to discussions with the importance of doing so at the level of the local trust involved in this research as well as the national level. This research also triggered two important pieces of research - one on development of a new generic outcome measure called Recovering Quality of Life (ReQoL) and another piece of research on the best ways of collecting PROMs. 
ReQoL was officially launched in October 2016 and is available for use.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C082CEDB-4450-46D3-81BB-5FD48F1EFEE7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460e0ded48d28.50206176</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research funded on this grant highlighted the weaknesses associated with patient reported outcome measures that are currently being used in mental health services.

Consequently a new measure called Recovering Quality of Life is under development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Recovering Quality of Life PROM was launched in Westminster in October 2016. NHS-England did not explicitly recommend a measure for use in the NHS to measure the outcomes of mental health service users and instead left this decision to individual trusts. A total of 50 licences have been granted to NHS trusts and academics overseas and nationally. Once the preference weights for the measure are available, we can expect ReQoL to be more widely used in studies and trials.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C5568B62-9FA3-415F-8299-C514C6A46E8B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460dda858b748.68158071</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.reqol.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A6867ADF-DBE4-4246-9AA5-E847A9E5FB14</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quality of life impact of mental health conditions in England: results from the adult psychiatric morbidity surveys</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health and Quality of Life Outcomes</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f292a39b42ba41bf5dd2c36eb13dce95"><gtr:id>f292a39b42ba41bf5dd2c36eb13dce95</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jennifer Roberts (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_5200190355034eb5e2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K005065/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
