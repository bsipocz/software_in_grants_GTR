It will contribute to cross-disciplinary and applied knowledge about the drivers and challenges of science and technology in relation to defence and security needs.

&lt;p>This project explores how these different contexts affect the management of risk and uncertainty in the development of security technologies. It examines how different understandings of risk and security interact in processes of technology development, how risks and uncertainties are negotiated and managed, and how the risk of failure and the security context shape the complex creative enterprise of technology development. The methods employed include analysis of key documents; observation of scientists and engineers in action, and interviews with key participants in different agencies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will produce a number of reports and workshops for government and other stakeholders as well as high quality academic publications. It will offer important lessons for technology development, implementation, and policy making, as well as for academic knowledge. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Audiences: There are three distinct primary communities which this project will impact beyond the academic community. 

Technology Development: includes research centres, SMEs and laboratories in both the public (University and Government) and private (Industry) sectors. These individuals are the scientists and engineers tasked with the concrete development and production (including testing and assessment) of technologies.

End-users: who will potentially use the technology developed for the purposes of security (particularly, but not exclusively, border security), i.e. European customs agencies, border guards, FRONTEX, first responders, police, civil security and others who constitute 'front-line' services in security and risk management.

Policy makers: primarily government actors whose responsibility it is to identify (national) defence and security needs, define the parameters of risk management for security and technology development, govern the implementation of security technologies, and fund/invest in the development of the technology itself. Although our primary target policy-making audience is in the UK, the case study we are using is actively transnational and our research will be likewise. Hence, our findings will also be relevant to policy makers at the EU level and other European national policy making communities, including Ireland, Portugal, Estonia and Germany.

How Audiences Will Benefit: This research will impact all three audiences in two distinct, but significant, ways: 

1) Collaboration Enhancement Strategies: 
Collaboration Enhancement is implicated in the organisational practices in industry and government, but most significantly in the mediations between the two sectors. Concrete recommendations for communications strategies to strengthen and develop stronger collaborations have the potential to lead to change organisational culture in technology development practices. Technology Developers will benefit here from enhanced ability to not only collaborate across different sectors within development, pursuing large scale, multi-platform and multi-application technologies through consortiums (as in HANDHOLD). For active research partners, this will be particularly beneficial as work HANDHOLD continues, but also in their future collaboration with other partners. End-users will benefit here from strategies that enable deeper collaboration in the process of development, enhancing effective feedback and input mechanisms. Policy makers will benefit from enhanced ability to manage complex collaboration across multiple sectors in an environment of high uncertainty, as is the case in defence and security. For all audiences, greater ability to collaborate will enhance research capacity, and their knowledge and skills in collaborative research and development.

2) Integration of Risk Management in Policy: 
The second impact is also implicated in the organisational practices with a greater focus on policy development and on managing the policy progress as affected by integration with S&amp;amp;T. Strategies for more deeply integrating a complex understanding of risk, and also of de-risking strategies, that account for the uncertainties inherent not only in the defence and security sector, but also in the process of technology development itself, will enhance the ability of policy makers to effectively account for failure, to capitalize on opportunities arising from the creative process, and to ensure that public investment is capitalised. Technology Developers will benefit here from greater understanding at the policy level of the processes and practices of technology development, and deeper integration of these dynamics into the policy process. End-users will benefit from enhanced partnerships between policy makers and technology developers and from more effective development processes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>188454</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Ireland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Office of the Revenue Commissioners</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaborations with border/customs organisations</gtr:description><gtr:id>F1D22198-5148-423C-8EDB-FDD9FFE98CCD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Internships are in their first year in 16/17.

Further, the PI was invited to participate in a European workshop in Toulouse in July 2015 in which TRUST findings were presented to a range of scientists, engineers, and European officials and experts (JRC). TRUST findings were utilised to stimulate reflection and discussion on risk management, competing understandings of success and failure, and collaboration and communication challenges. Participants indicated that they found the findings and discussions very interesting and potentially useful for their future work. TRUST findings have also been presented in keynotes and a PaCCS policy briefing arising from events organised through PaCCS in 2015 and 2016. 

Throughout all impact related activities participants including engineers, customs officials, industry, and wider government have expressed interest in the findings, particularly around the issues of tacit knowledge and risk, and around utilising the findings to rethink engagements with failure. At these events and beyond (including a response to the Warwick impact survey) stakeholders indicated that the TRUST research and impact activities shaped attitudes and values, improved knowledge, and contributed to improvements in risk management and enhance best practice or inform stakeholder relations. In particular several stakeholders have indicated that the findings enhance understanding and engagement with the composition and behaviour of research project groups. Thus the project has contributed practically useful lessons on the dynamics of science and engineering in complex projects related to security; and provided opportunities for reflection on possible changes in practice, improvements in understanding, and more nuanced understandings of risk. 

The project also enabled the development of collaborative networks between the TRUST project social scientists and a range of engineers that have since yielded collaborative research funding applications and wider engagements with government. In addition, the findings and networks generated through the TRUST project have been integral to the development of a groundbreaking new MA course at QUB on Global Security and Borders. This includes in depth engagement with bordering challenges and a pioneering internship programme. 

Academic publication has been extensive and is continuing, with two further articles about to submitted (one to a leading International Relations journal and another to a leading Criminology journal).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0B2D44C7-6687-47AA-87DE-B328475F0A49</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460ced447ee73.93897952</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant objectives were fully met. We conducted in depth multi-sited ethnographic research on the case study of the development of the Handhold CBRNE detector including undertaking around 50 interviews with the scientists and engineers of the project, end users, and wider government and industry; and 20 ethnographic observations of laboratories, meetings and key events in the Handhold process. On this basis we followed the patterns of communication, interaction and negotiation between engineers, end-users and others. This enabled the development of a deep understanding of how security technologies are developed. We produced new cross-disciplinary knowledge through engagement between social scientists and engineers, and developed new insights in the intersections of politics, sociology, and Science and Technology Studies. 
We developed significant new knowledge that indicates that far from being a linear application of scientific knowledge to security problems, engineering and security practices are co-constitutive within the daily practices, materials and imaginations of scientists and engineers. We found that security is translated into specific device development through the interactions of engineers and end-users, but also through the operation of forms of imagination and anticipation. Security device development is shaped by wider institutional forces and logics of pragmatism, profit, risk-mitigation, publication, knowledge development and others that combine with - and sometimes outweigh -logics of security (designations of threat, anticipated bordering practices and environments). 
Our unique study of a multi-country security device development process enabled us to show that the pathway of development, and patterns of interaction, were shaped more by the highly contingent combination of these forces and practices than by differences in culture, language, institutional (academic, SME etc) or even scientific discipline (e.g. biology or physics). Thereby we showed that the laboratories of security device development are key sites within which security practices are constituted such that sovereign decisions at the border are distributed into the laboratories of engineers. 
Our focus on risk, uncertainty and failure opened new research questions and methods for tracing the co-constitution of science and security in daily practices. Risk, for instance, is understood and practiced not through exceptional security logics, nor through formalised quantification, but rather is ever-present and dispersed in the daily practices of engineers. Here, experience and tacit knowledge shape risk assessment and also form the central activity of risk management. Likewise, while technology development is inherently uncertain, uncertainty was reduced both by experience and by imaginations (of border guards, of sniffer dogs, of criminals and terrorists). In this process the failure is reconceived as the means of success. 
This research yielded numerous findings and recommendations for enhancing communication and understanding between government, engineers and end-users involved in the development of security technologies; and for enhancing common understandings of risk, uncertainty and failure in security technology development. (See Government and Stakeholders Report). 
The research findings and recommendations were disseminated through two workshops, two reports, and several conference papers and journal articles. The research process also generated new research networks, productive engagements with DSTL, and yielded methodological innovations in the practice of cooperative team-based multi-sited ethnography.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have been disseminated through two interactive workshops (one with participant scientists and engineers; one with wider government and industry stakeholders) in which the findings of the project were used to stimulate interactive working groups that explored and formed recommendations on risk, competing understandings of success and failure, and collaboration and communication strategies. Detailed practical recommendations derived from our findings and the workshops are available in reports that have been disseminated widely and made available on the internet. 
Further means of taking forward our findings include: 
1) Cross-Disciplinary Impact through further publication, including academic journals. This may include publication in an engineering rather than a social science journal in order to reach a scientific audience. Further development of collaborative research and education with engineers, specifically the Handhold summer school 2015.
2) Disseminating methodological innovations in a journal article.
3) Building upon positive relationships with DSTL produced through the project to conduct further activities with DSTL and partners. 
4) The Integrator Project will be central to widening impact activities, including integrator workshops and the conference in September 2015. This has so far enabled productive discussions of common themes (risk, uncertainty, etc.) with other projects in the Science and Security programme.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>73CE89C0-726B-4429-8723-6CF57C00FC98</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54bfd861e690b9.93323010</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and
