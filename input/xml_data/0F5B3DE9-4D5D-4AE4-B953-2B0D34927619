Since Josquin's music is seen as an artistic pinnacle (he has often been characterized as a Renaissance Beethoven), the generation that followed him has received very little attention from scholars or performers. Moreover, the qualities of 'transparency' and 'clarity' that Josquin epitomizes (which are achieved to some extent through the use of very spare textures) are prized in comparison with the richer sonorities preferred by the younger generation. In striving to build a more impressive sound than that of the period 1500-20, these composers necessarily had to extend their conception of tonality: moreover, at this time the modal system, which had previously been used to classify plainchant melodies, begins to become linked by theorists with polyphonic writing. This resulted in tensions between small-scale contrapuntal considerations (how to create consonance between two or more voices) and the larger modal organization (how the form of the piece is governed by relationships between tonal centres). They also increased the number of voice parts in their compositions, moving from a norm of four voices to five, six, or more. The complexity of their music is thus much greater than that of previous composers, and this causes problems of analysis, of performance, and consequently of reception.\n\nThe notation of music at this period is superficially similar to that of modern music (other than usually appearing in individual parts rather than full score), but incorporates significant nuances due to its underprescriptiveness by our standards. These would typically have been resolved during rehearsals, with the composer present (many composers were themselves singers); sixteenth-century witnesses describe this process. In order to gain a fuller understanding of the negotiation between composer and performer in the sixteenth century, it is therefore necessary to recreate the circumstances in which composers and performers worked, with the editor taking the place of the composer. By working carefully on details such as inflections (sharps and flats are rarely notated, though often necessary), underlay (often filled in incorrectly by printers' editors, and rarely specific), and tuning (vital to the sonority that is an important part of this music's expressivity, and again distinct from modern practice), it will be possible to derive significant insights from performance that will be of benefit both to the scholarly community and to the general public.\n\nThe research will be disseminated through concerts, CDs to be released on the Hyperion label, a scholarly edition and at least one scholarly article. In the first year I shall work on the music of Pierre Moulu (?1484-c.1550), composer related to the French royal court and pioneer of advanced contrapuntal techniques: this will result in a CD recording and the inception of a critical edition of his music (to be completed in the second year). In the second year I shall concentrate on Nicolas Gombert (c.1495-c.1557), a musician at the Spanish Habsburg court, whose music is particularly rich in the complexities of tonality, inflection etc. mentioned above. Being slightly younger than Moulu and working in a different area, Gombert will provide useful control material for the study of composing practice. I shall also make a CD of music by Loyset Pi&amp;eacute;ton (fl. 1530-45) another overlooked composer. In the final year the research strands will be brought together and one or more articles prepared which will analyse the findings; a third CD will also be recorded. Concert-giving will be continual during the course of the Fellowship.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>214444</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Brabant Ensemble under the PI's direction gave a concert in Evora, Portugal, containing works by Jacobus Clemens non Papa recorded as part of the present grant, alongside Portuguese Renaissance repertoire.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7FA75DED-E57A-45F3-9666-DE269021D056</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reception by an international audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-123775182.40713997a718595e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Concert in &quot;Eborae Musica&quot; series, 4 October 2010</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Brabant Ensemble under the PI's direction performed Jean Mouton's Missa Tu es Petrus with motets by Mouton and Dominique Phinot (c.1510-bef.1561).

These were supplemented by live performances detailed in the 'outcomes' section.

Of Moulu's masses, Missa Alma redemptoris mater proved to be of particular interest: this piece has been known to musicologists for many years due to its unusual canon, under which it may be performed either with or without all the rests longer than a minim. For this reason it was described in several of its sources as Messe &amp;agrave; deux visaiges or Missa duarum facierum. The source situation of this Mass setting is exceptionally complex, with seventeen extant sources (one of which has only recently been discovered in the Czech Republic), and approximately 600 variants. It would appear that the canon, which was indicated using a system of signa congruentiae, caused difficulties of interpretation for scribes and print editors, since several of the sources contain errors or other evidence of scribal/editorial confusion. One source central to the Mass's transmission history is so corrupt that a later redaction of the piece came into existence, with corrections to the corrupt readings in the earlier source, and in this later version the Mass continued to circulate across the continent into the seventeenth century. A hypothesis has been developed as to the identity of the person who made the corrections; the transmission history of this Mass will be explored in a journal article, rather than in the introduction to the edition, due to pressure of space. These findings were communicated in a paper given at the Medieval and Renaissance Music Conference in Nottingham in July 2012.

As well as Moulu, two other CDs were released, of music by Jacobus Clemens non Papa and Orlandus Lassus respectively. The former contains Clemens's Missa pro defunctis and penitential motets for four and five voices; on the latter are the non-liturgical motet cycle Prophetiae Sibyllarum, a previously unrecorded Mass setting &amp;agrave;6, a Magnificat, and three motets. Both received highly favourable reviews in the specialist music press, and the latter also in two UK broadsheet newspapers. Selected reviews are listed at http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDA67848&amp;amp;vw=dc (Clemens) and http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDA67887&amp;amp;vw=dc (Lassus).

In making these three recordings, as well as that of Jean Mouton supported by the concurrent grant received by the PI, numerous points of comparison emerged between the four composers involved, and with the repertory already recorded by the PI. These are the subject of a journal article in preparation. In particular the compositional technique of Clemens exhibits important differences from that of his contemporaries, notably Thomas Crecquillon, with whom his work was frequently confused in the sixteenth century. Clemens adopts a less rigorous approach to counterpoint than does Crecquillon, resulting in a sharper differentiation between voice parts. In the music of Crecquillon and other Low Countries composers such as Gombert, the upper four voices of a standard five-voice texture contain very similar numbers of cadences, imitative entries, dissonances and other stylistic markers, whereas in Clemens the highest voice is far more dominant, anticipating in some respects the stratification of texture which occurred later in the century.

The recording of Lassus represents a new interpretation of the modal and tonal-type relationship between the thirteen movements. The six pairs of movements (the piece's notorious &amp;quot;chromatic prologue&amp;quot; is attached to the first pair) are notated in a variety of cleffing and stave signature arrangements, representing five different tonal types, and with voice ranges varying according to the cleffings. The notated vocal ranges of the four voice parts are thus inconsistent between the movements, presenting a performance difficulty to which this recording proposes a new solution involving transposition in both directions. The result is a more tonally conjunct series of tonal types and finals than previously achieved, particularly in relation to the 'low-clef' movements where theoretical evidence is comparatively sketchy.</gtr:description><gtr:id>41A17104-F983-4BB4-AA0E-9D7D65E2413F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2062050515.8436022775f84e6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F015720/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
