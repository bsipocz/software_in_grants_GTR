One dominant answer to those questions says that public argument is only possible to the extent that religious participants keep private their commitment to particular traditions of religious thought and practice. However, other answers are possible - answers that focus upon the practices of reasoning internal to each religious traditions, and upon the patterns of shared reasoning that are possible when those differing practices are brought into interaction.One prominent example of work that explores this possibility has been the development of a practice of inter-faith discussion called 'Scriptural Reasoning' (SR). In SR members of different religious traditions meet in small groups to discuss extracts from their sacred or authoritative texts together. In the process, a member of one tradition learns to explain to those who do not share her tradition the reading and reasoning practices by which her judgments (including judgments about public issues) are shaped. She also learns to respond to questions about those practices, to understand the different reading and reasoning practices by which the judgments of other participants are shaped, and to experiment as a reader of the other participants' texts. The normal outcome of the process is not consensus but a deeper understanding of the roots of others' judgments, an understanding of the kinds of flexibility and responsiveness built in to one's own tradition and the traditions of others, and an understanding of the kinds of arguments that might make sense to those whose authorities and traditions of reasoning differ from one's own. This practice of inter-faith reasoning therefore deepens understanding both within and between traditions, and enables the development of practices of reasoned debate across traditions.Existing face-to-face implementations of the SR model amongst scholars, religious leaders, students, school children, civic leaders and ordinary citizens have proved encouraging, and have demonstrated that this is a practice with a potential for transformational impact in a society where religious commitment and commitment to shared public discourse are often assumed to be opposed. Face-to-face implementation is, however, unavoidably limited: gathering multi-faith groups for discussion is expensive; numbers are limited; geographical constrains mean that participants tend to be from similar cultural backgrounds; and the mono-lingual nature of the discussions both reduces the range of possible participants, and presents particular constraints for some Muslim participants for whom reliance on as-yet-untranslated Arabic textual authorities and traditions of reasoning is essential.To ensure that the potential transformational impact of SR is realised, these limitations need to be overcome. This project offers an innovative way to do so by taking SR practice onto the web and across languages. We will build on an existing online inter-faith platform (developed by the Cambridge Inter-faith Program and the non-profit technology company Meedan) which includes a facility for machine-assisted human translation of content and discussions between Arabic and English. By means of extensive user testing with a variety of non-academic user groups drawn from Christian and Islamic communities in the UK and the Middle East, we will tailor this platform for specific use in Christian-Muslim SR, extending SR across geographical and linguistic barriers in the process.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is directed towards improving social cohesion, and enhancing cultural enrichment. The project will primarily benefit members of Christian and Islamic religious communities, in the UK and in the Middle East, with an interest in inter-faith relations, including religious leaders and those training for positions of religious leadership. This will include some members and leaders of religious communities who are concerned about inter-faith relations, but who are suspicious of those existing modes of inter-faith engagement that appear to require some degree of watering down of commitment to one's own religious community, or that appear to brush real differences under the carpet for the sake of a focus on what is shared. This Research in the Wild project will enable such people to participate in a carefully designed process of inter-faith discussion with a proven capacity to increase inter-faith understanding, and allow inter-faith argument, without requiring the compromising of deeply held religious commitments. The online implementation will deepen this impact by allowing this inter-faith encounter to take place across geographical and linguistic barriers. The simple fact of being able to enter into discussion with members of another faith community (rather than relying on stereotypes and hearsay) can itself have a transformative impact, and promote social cohesion. But the SR method enhances that impact by (a) ensuring that the engagement includes detailed and sensitive engagement with the central scriptural resources of the differing traditions, and so promotes understandings of the deep patterns of commitment and reasoning that shape each participant's community; and by (b) ensuring that participants discover that real discussion between them is possible, even when they are beholden to very different authorities and traditions of religious reasoning. As the Pathways to Impact document and accompanying Statements of Support set out in detail, we intend to draw on a wide range of different Christian and Islamic communities to provide the test users for this project, and to build interest amongst those communities so that the mature platform can be deployed widely once the project is finished. The potential impact of this project is not, however, limited to the people from these various religious communities who actually become users. We expect a wider impact upon the communities themselves, generated by the presence in them of increased numbers of individuals who have had this experience of inter-faith encounter, and who have been brought at least briefly into friendly relation with members of other faiths, and who can therefore go some way to countering stereotypes and misapprehensions about other faiths that circulate in their communities. We also hope for an even wider impact upon the religiously plural societies within which these religious communities sit, by chipping away at the inter-religious misunderstandings and antagonisms that generate tensions on local, national and global scales.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288679</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scriptural Reasoning</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>86999E38-A5FC-453B-B174-240C7D775030</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This website provides all the introductory materials that people new to the 'Scriptural Reasoning' form of inter-faith dialogue need to understand how it works and what it is for. These materials (including a number of 'text bundles' providing sets of extracts from scriptural texts that can be used as the focus for a Scriptural Reasoning dialogue) have either been created or thoroughly revised in response to feedback from users of Nurani. We made a decision to present these introductory materials on a separate site from the online dialogue platform itself (www.nurani.org) so that there could be a clear line between the open, public, 'busy' feel of www.scripturalreasoning.org and the calm, moderated, confidential feel of www.nurani.org. The Scriptural Reasoning site also contains a good deal of information about off-line Scriptural Reasoning, not generated by the present project. It directs people interested in taking part in online Scriptural Reasoning to nurani.org, and explains the process of requesting involvement in a group there.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7210390174.0260332b841a3c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nurani</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>94C8B1F5-4D8F-420B-ACBF-61D620C4FD27</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nurani is our online inter-faith dialogue platform. It is designed to allow the form of dialogue known as 'Scriptural Reasoning'. As a result of the present project, it has been completely re-designed in response to user feedback, to make it easier for users from all kinds of backgrounds to take part in the dialogue as easily as possible, and it has had new text-citation functionality added to make it easier for moderators to select and manage texts for discussion, and for users to cite texts during discussions. Every aspect of the user interface, and most of the technology behind the scenes, has been re-written in order to make participation in the groups richer and less threatening for a wide variety of non-academic participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8096999207.6018822b8406dc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our primary impact is on members of faith communities (Christian, Islamic and Jewish) who have been given the opportunity to engage in an innovative form of inter-faith dialogue. These participants have had the experience of reading extracts from their scriptures alongside one another, and in the process learning not just more about each other but also more about their own texts and traditions. This is the first time this dialogue process (known as 'Scriptural Reasoning'), which has a proven track record in its face-to-face version, has successfully been taken online to non-academic audiences. This project has enabled us to take a tool for such dialogue (nurani.org) that was in beta, and that had been used only by a small number of test users, and refine it until it was suitable for public use. We have now held 15 dialogues on the platform, including a total of 60 unique users, all of whom were ordinary members of faith communities, many of whom have participated in multiple groups. Groups have typically worked together for three to four weeks each.

The health of the public square depends on the capacity of its participants to engage in serious conversation about their ideas, values and commitments, and about the pressing issues that face them. Scriptural Reasoning is a form of dialogue designed to allow members of different religious communities to engage in such serious discussion. It involves members of different religious traditions meeting in small groups to discuss extracts from their sacred or authoritative texts together. In the process, a member of one tradition learns to articulate to those who do not share her tradition the reading and reasoning practices by which her judgments (including judgments about public issues) are shaped. She also learns to respond to questions about those practices, to understand the different reading and reasoning practices by which the judgments of other participants are shaped by their own texts, and to experiment as a reader of the other participants' texts. The intended outcome of the process is not consensus, but a deeper understanding of the roots of others' judgments, an understanding of the kinds of flexibility and responsiveness built in to her own and others' traditions, and an understanding of the kinds of arguments that might make sense to those whose authorities and traditions of reasoning differ from her own. Scriptural Reasoning has proven a very successful form of inter-faith dialogue, and is now widely used around the UK and internationally. Our project has, for the first time, taken this process online, and has therefore allowed more diverse and more widely spread audiences to take part. We have so far held 15 groups, including a total of 60 individual participants from various Jewish, Christian and Islamic communities.

Beneficiaries: Members of faith communities

Contribution Method: There is an existing academic community (national and international) involved in developing and delivering the Scriptural Reasoning form of dialogue for non-academic audiences. That community has experimented before with online versions of the process, but none of those experiments has created a form of online Scriptural Reasoning ready for non-academic participants. The heart of this project was repeated engagement with ordinary users who were taking part in dialogues on our online Scriptural Reasoning platform, and then refining its design and functionality until it provided an accessible and usable online environment for this form of dialogue. The research conducted during this project has therefore made this form of impact - participation in Scriptural Reasoning dialogues by non-academic audiences - possible for online cohorts for the first time. We have also disseminated the results of that research to the academic Scriptural Reasoning community, and made the online platform available for their use, and thereby extended the capacity of that wider academic community to host such online dialogues.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0FE15C5E-97B7-4E0D-BDE3-13C5A63CAB6B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-2978569756.242046de25eeca</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has focused on the 'Scriptural Reasoning' form of inter-faith dialogue, which is now widespread in the UK and internationally, and has proven to be very successful in allowing serious discussion between ordinary members of different faith communities.
