However, it has been identified that for some bioenergy crops lifecycle C emissions can be significant, compromising the capacity of bioenergy to deliver net C savings. Land-use change to bioenergy crops can result in a change in the level of C sequestered and released from the soil, with changes dependant on the type of land cultivated and the crop grown. These impacts can be measured and regulated against but knowledge of the direct effects of land-use change to bioenergy on soil C and GHG emissions at a location-specific level has been lacking (RFA, 2008). This uncertainty over the C savings delivered by bioenergy has been identified by global industry and the UK government as a major bottleneck constraining the expansion of bioenergy deployment. 

In the UK, the majority of bioenergy feedstocks for power generation are imported. This is expected to continue through to 2050, although domestic biomass supplies are predicted to make a more significant contribution beyond 2030. Improved knowledge of the direct effects of land-use change to bioenergy in both a UK and international context will help to underpin UK government energy policy, enabling more informed decisions to be made and regulation put in place to ensure the sustainability of bioenergy used in the UK. 

NERC-CEH has developed a reputation for high-quality research in this field, leading and collaborating on NERC, RCUK and industry-funded projects focused on bioenergy sustainability and the effects of land-use change to bioenergy on soil C and GHG emissions. Two key projects have been the ETI-ELUM project and NERC Carbo-BioCrop (ETI / McNamara LoS). Through these projects, NERC scientists and ELUM partners have developed rigorous methodologies for bioenergy soil GHG measurements and state-of-the art process based modelling of bioenergy land-use change effects which provide a potential scientific solution to the problem of robust assessment of direct effects of land-use change to bioenergy at a location-specific level.

The potential implications and applications of these research outcomes need to be disseminated and discussed with stakeholders in order to stimulate uptake of these methods, models and expertise. This will be done by establishing two-way dialogue with stakeholders in order to: (1) understand the needs of stakeholders and how NERC bioenergy science can help them achieve their goals; (2) develop mechanisms by which uptake of this research can be facilitated to deliver economic, environmental and societal benefits; (3) investigate mechanisms by which NERC bioenergy research could help to underpin international sustainability standards for bioenergy; and (4) demonstrate to stakeholders the value of being part of this research activity through an &amp;quot;Industry Knowledge Club&amp;quot;.

Reducing uncertainty over the direct effects of land-use change to bioenergy crops on soil GHG emissions is essential for industry and government if sustainable bioenergy is to contribute significantly to the UK energy mix. However to reap the economic, environmental and societal benefits a strong cooperation between the research community and end-users is needed. This KE fellowship will maximise the impact of NERC bioenergy science, by stimulating industry and policymaker involvement and use of the research outcomes including data, models and expertise. This will involve activities designed to bring together the cross-council research community with stakeholders to identify practical applications for NERC science and explore novel funding routes for research on this urgent issue currently facing human society which encompasses climate change, energy use and the development of sustainable resources.

The workshop was attended by 26 invited attendees. These included national and international stakeholders with an interest in bioenergy sustainability from industry (Shell, BP, AHDB Cereals and Oilseeds), policymakers (DECC, EU JRC, UNCCD) and a range of universities (UK, Belgium, Brazil, USA).
The aims of the workshop were: to compare outcomes from UK research on bioenergy and land-use change in a global context; identify industry and policy requirements to direct future research; and identify how we can progress towards more complete sustainability accounting for bioenergy and agricultural land-use. During the workshop the key areas of consensus from UK and international studies were collated and the research gaps and uncertainties were discussed and prioritised through discussion. 

Main outcomes: 
1. Plan for research proposal exploring what would be required to deliver the existing UK bioenergy strategy, using life-cycle assessments of bioenergy futures. Funding routes are being explored but there was interest form government departments in supporting this. 
2.
