Patterns)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/K025023/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>People who are physically active as they get older are more likely to remain healthy and independent, whatever their circumstances. High levels of sedentary behaviour are associated with poor health, regardless of how physically active a person is at other points in the day. Although older people spend more time sitting than other age groups, surprisingly little research attention has been devoted to either understanding in detail the link between sedentary behaviour and health or finding out what factors determine how active or sedentary older people are. We have assembled a team of researchers with a wide range of knowledge, skills and experience of working in collaboration with older people to try to unpick these important questions. Our team has been working with two large groups (cohorts) of older people living in and around Edinburgh (since 2004) and Glasgow (since 1987). These people have regularly completed questionnaires about various aspects of their lives and many of them have had detailed assessments of their physical fitness (including grip strength and lung function), their health and their cognitive function (including brain scans).

In the current study, we will ask 750 members of these cohorts to wear a small device for a week that will give us an accurate (objective) measurement of how active and sedentary they are over that period. We will compare our objective measurements with participants' own self-reported estimates of how active and sedentary they have been over the same period (using past cohort questions and current population survey questions) to identify the most accurate survey tool to use in the future. Using these data and the information about these peoples' daily life, activities and health collected during our cohort studies, we will investigate the relationship between previous individual, social and environmental factors and older people's current sedentary and activity levels. We will also examine the effect of being sedentary and largely inactive on a person's health. This will help us identify those people who are most at risk of becoming more sedentary and less active in later life. For example, there is some evidence from the Glasgow group that working class men may be particularly vulnerable to inactivity when they retire.

In addition, we will interview 48 of these cohort members (equal numbers of men and women of different ages and social class who are currently active or inactive) to understand: their views about being sedentary, what they do while they are sitting and how important these activities are to them. We will also ask them about their knowledge about sedentary behaviour and the links between being sedentary and ill health and ways older people might be encouraged to become less sedentary and the barriers that might stop them doing so. We will also understand how receptive different groups of older people (e.g. men vs. women) might be to suggestions about changing their sedentary activities. 

Taken together, these views and understandings of the positive and negative aspects of being sedentary will help to design more effective interventions to encourage older people to become less sedentary and more physically active. We will publish and present our findings at international and national conferences and provide recommendations and workshops for professionals on how to develop and tailor support to encourage people to become more physically activity and less sedentary as they age. We will make use of the internet, social media and YouTube brief videos, produce leaflets and host meetings for a wide range of older people and organisations, giving our results and recommendations the best chance to make a positive impact on future research, policy and practice to improve the quality of life of older people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Prolonged sitting (sedentary behaviour) is an adverse health behaviour which predicts health risk, independent of other activity behaviours. Interventions aiming to reduce sedentary behaviour require knowledge about the determinants and long- and short-term effects of being sedentary. We will collect objective measures of current patterns of activity and sedentary behaviour (using activPal monitors) in 750 older people (in their 60s, 70s and 80s) from two large cohorts: the West of Scotland Twenty-07 Study and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. We will characterise the most sensitive objective and subjective ways of reporting activity behaviour. Cohort members have participated in a wide range of prior investigations (e.g. cognitive tests; questionnaires, including self-reported activity/sitting time; medical examinations; blood tests; brain scans). We will use these longitudinal data to investigate individual, social and environmental determinants of current activity/sedentary behaviours and identify which factors are associated with high risk of sedentary behaviour as people age. We will explore the consistency of associations across the cohorts, and the effect that activity/sedentary behaviour has on subsequent health outcomes. Within a selected subsample (n=48) we will investigate the meaning/relevance/importance of, and attitudes towards, sedentary behaviour. Collectively we aim to produce definitive data on: the determinants of sedentary behaviour; the health/cognitive outcomes of long-term inactivity; the views of older people on becoming less sedentary; and the potential benefits to an older person of sitting less or breaking periods of sedentary behaviour more frequently. We will provide recommendations for tailoring future interventions to change and report on older people's activity behaviour.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Very few older adults reach the recommended levels of activity for health. In the UK, the estimated direct cost of physical inactivity to the NHS is &amp;pound;10 billion. Most health promotion initiatives have focussed on increasing levels of moderate physical activity or specific forms of exercising for health. Such initiatives could have substantial financial impact: The draft Scottish Charter for Physical Activity reports an economic benefit of &amp;pound;85.2 million if the number of inactive Scots was reduced by 1% each year for the next five years. However, new evidence suggests that too much sitting (sedentary behaviour) is a distinct health risk, independent of other physical activity behaviours and older people spend a great deal of their time sitting.

We aim to advance understanding of the life course determinants of patterns of sedentary and activity behaviour in older adults. We will do this by objectively measuring activity patterns in two large Scottish longitudinal cohorts (with a wide range of socioeconomic status, co-morbidities and age) and determining associations with detailed prior assessments of their physical fitness, health and cognitive function. We will determine the subsequent long term health outcomes of sedentary behaviour alongside older people's views of their own activity histories. This will enable us to impact on future intervention development, particularly in terms of 'who' should be targeted and 'how'. We will be able to inform researchers for future studies and population surveys of the best way to pose self-report questions to give valid and reliable responses, because we will be able to compare such questions with objectively measured activity patterns. This should allow a more accurate report of the activity of the older population and changes in activity over time for policy makers.

By exploring older people's views of the effects of sitting and of the potential strategies that could use to help motivate behaviour change, we will be able inform the design of interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in older people. This research will provide useful information to inform guidelines and to inform providers in certain settings (eg. hospital wards) about desirable mobilisation support and encouragement. It will also provide evidence to support older people living independently to make informed changes (eg. standing in TV advert breaks).

The beneficiaries of this research will include older people, researchers, policy makers, service providers and health/social care/fitness professionals. We will train six researchers in new measurement techniques, statistical analysis of longitudinal data, qualitative methods and analyses, as well as dissemination and knowledge exchange strategies. We will work closely with our Dissemination Advisory Group, through reports, recommendations and the internet, to impact on the culture and practice with service providers and professionals working with older people in the NHS, social care, sheltered housing, residential care and the fitness industry and to engage with government as well as non-governmental, third sector and the commercial private sector. The team have strong links with both national and international organisations and initiatives dedicated to increasing physical activity amongst older people that would benefit from the knowledge gained and provision of practice oriented literature, webinars and short video clips to help change culture and knowledge in their areas of expertise. In short, this research has the potential to impact on the Nation's quality of life through encouraging changes in culture and practice, across all the potential beneficiaries, to reduce long periods of sedentary behaviour and move more often.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>812178</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Edinburgh</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Seniors USP Collaboration Agreement between Research Institutions</gtr:description><gtr:id>0FB2DFC5-B31B-4577-8562-A7E8EA7F3ED7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet, project started in May 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e16aba06ef3.24174528-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Protocol agreements and roles and responsibilities, financial reporting and management structures.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Discussions on final research team contributions and financial implications to the Senior USP Project.

&amp;quot;It's always a good sign when they have to put out extra chairs,&amp;quot; said Ian Deary, after his talk on 16th February to Penicuik's branch of the University of the Third Age. &amp;quot;They said they usually get 30-50 people, but I lost count after 60. It's great to see such enthusiasm for hearing about healthy cognitive ageing and the Lothian Birth Cohorts' contribution to that. I encouraged people in the audience to ask any questions as we went along, and they were good at that. However, there were lots more excellent questions and discussions at the end of the talk. They wanted to know the evidence about many things, including genetics, dementia, physical exercise, smoking, sleep and cognitive engagement. I was especially pleased, when I was having my tea and custard cream afterwards, when an audience member congratulated my team on demonstrating reverse causation for some potential factors in cognitive ageing!&amp;quot; We note that Ian cycled to and from Penicuik to give the talk, which we hope contributed a little towards keeping him sharp.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c113ff9798e1.06403619</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ccace.ed.ac.uk/node/342</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seniors USP Engagement Activity - GCU (Dawn Skelton) ROAR Reaching Older Adults in Renfrew AGM 1st Oct 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21CA0818-343E-43C1-BAD0-2863F1068992</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ROAR (Reaching Older Adults in Renfrew) Annual General Meeting.

The discussed an Age Scotland Blog (which mostly goes to staff members of Age Scotland), an article in their quarterly magazine ADVANTAGE and regular posts on their Facebook and Twitter sites.

This and the blog led to a piece being written by Professor Skelton in the Winter Edition of ADVANTAGE (not out at time of this submission but in press). Future activity with Age Scotland is being planned. The talk has led to further discussion with the CEO Brian Sloan, who has now set up an &amp;quot;Active at Work&amp;quot; group within the Age Scotland offices with representation from each of the teams within the Age Scotland head office. We are currently in discussion about a Partnership Agreement between GCU and Age Scotland.

To date sittonomy has collected over 50000 labels which form a taxonomy generated by folks (folksonomy). In parallel the project engaged 120 experts internaitonally to develop an expert xonsensus taxonomy. This taxonomy has been adopted by the Joint European Initiative on Diet and Physical Activity action on determinants of diet and physical activity www.dedipac.eu.
Several conferences presentation were delivered in 2012-2014 about this project and the first results published in PLOS One as the project required that the result be publish in open access journal.

There has been a lot of different impact from sittonomy. It has allowed us to engage the public of all ages in research on sedentary behaviour and raise awareness about sedentary behaviour. We also engaged with a lot of different organisation via social media and the project currently has over 400 followers on twitter. The taxonomy has been adapted as standard to harmonise and plan future european research by the European Joint Initiative on the Determinants of Diet and Physical Actitvity. Ultimately the mixing of expert consensus and folksonomy aim at bringing a common language and terminology between researcher and the public.
Similar project are planned for other health behaviour.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546295384f2671.33752101</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sittonomy.net</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seniors USP Dissemination Group Meetings</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>664B4016-7AB7-4614-9B78-864C1AD8D52C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Senior USP Project has a Dissemination Group which includes members of a wide variety of organisations, including charities, health and social care, NHS and older peoples organisations.

The next meeting is the 12th November 2014.
Remit of the DAG: The Dissemination Advisory Group will:
? Ensure that the Project website and documentation is understandable to the wide variety of professionals and lay public it is aimed at
? Help advertise amongst their networks to ensure good attendance at the seminars and webinars proposed within the project and aimed at both professionals and older people [M3, M5, M20, M31 and M35]
? Feed into the two reports to the MRC on dissemination and impact of the project [M18, M36]
? Feed onto the Report to policy makers, national survey leads and academics on most accurate and sensitive self-report measures of SB to use in research and practice [M24]
? Feed into the Leaflets for older people and professionals working with older people on the effects of Sedentary Behaviour and advice on breaking patterns of Sedentary Behaviour [M35]
? Feed into the Final Summary Report of the research project to all participating cohort members, older volunteers and research partners [M36]
? Feed into the Intervention translational manual for researchers and professionals working with older people on lessons learned [M36].


The Dissemination Group gave invaluable feedback on dissemination routes within and outwith their organisations (for organisations see Project Meeting Start Up reporting). They also suggested changes to the Patient Information Sheets and the wording of the sedentary behaviour questions to be used in the project to ensure relevance and understanding in an older population. Changes to the patient information sheet and the questionnaires have been actioned as a result of this meeting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54567395a60745.56258597</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seniors USP Engagement Activity - GCU Shaping the Future of Health Research Event, 6th June 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>769F5597-26EC-4771-B403-C7CA5EA9214D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This morning event explored and consolidated GCU's relationships with the third sector (e.g. voluntary organisations) with regard to research.

BBC1 are planning a series in the Spring called 'Holding back the years'. Each programme will feature a celebrity revisiting a place that means a lot to them, and the programmes will have a focus on the processes of human ageing. Mr Turnbull was at the University of Edinburgh in the 1970's (he shared a flat with Gordon Brown for a term!), and so his programme is based here. It was natural that, to find out more about ageing, and with an Edinburgh locus, he and the BBC filming team visited the LBC1936. A busy afternoon's filming was filled with his interviewing LBC1936 Director Ian Deary, speaking with about a dozen of the LBC1936 participants, and seeing and taking part in some cognitive testing. Look out for the series, especially the Edinburgh-based Bill Turnbull programme in a few months' time.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c113a9215921.63026287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ccace.ed.ac.uk/node/340</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seniors USP Media - Go for Gold Challenge Newsletter, Care Inspectorate and BHF NCPAH, Summer Edition, 2014 - Understanding Sedentary Patterns or 'Chair Beware?'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9963E00A-41A2-4726-88C3-74C991D18F38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An article written in the Go For Gold Challenge Newsletter from the Care Inspectorate, Scotland and the BHF National Centre for Physical Activity and Health.

She highlighted the Seniors USP project and encouraged Age Scotland workers to sit less and be more active as well as encouraging the older people they work with to do the same.
This stimulated the invitation to write a piece for ADVANTAGE, the quarterly Age Scotland Magasine for older people - due out in the Winter Edition 2014.

Age Scotland office staff have been sitting for less time and incorporating more standing work opportunities. Age Scotland have suggested that the first step is just to take notice of the amount of sitting that the staff all do in a working day and think about how they can be more active. They suggested making a point of standing up when they answer the phone or have standing or walking meetings. 
One Team member was particularly enthusiastic - from the Men in Sheds Team - and encouraged the Men in her scheme to create a Standing Desk for Jenny, which she now uses.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e22d2ecad39.67672499</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://agescotland.wordpress.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seniors USP Engagement Activity - BHF NCPAH (Bob Laventure) Functional Fitness MOT Training for Physical Activity Professionals across UK - variety of dates</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>16461884-3C4A-4FFA-8A1D-2566108AC247</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Functional Fitness MOT workshop training for health and social care professionals in Birmingham, Rochdale, Edinburgh, Gosforth, Scunthorpe (over 150 people) which include updated information on reducing sedentary behaviour and MRC Seniors USP Briefings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d1b090ad6bb5.15670371</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Internal meeting at AGE UK Briefing - Iva Cukic - 28/7/16</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93F8A098-81D7-432B-815B-F975B17CD3D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Internal meeting at AGE UK Briefing for an Age UK Research Advisor</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589c767dd529e7.26282524</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9B295CB0-631B-4634-9110-8416E5D96637</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop at the ISBNPA Conference, South Africa, June 2016 entitled &amp;quot;Measuring Sedentary Behaviour In an Intervention Context&amp;quot; led by Paul Gardiner and supported by Sebastien Chastin and Manon Dontje.

Speakers covered a large variety of topics including cognitive ageing, devolution, politics, history, literature, fashion, Islam, capitalism, cycling, RBS, the Lockerbie bombing, whisky and women's equality, but all with a focus on Scotland. Ian's talk was entitled &amp;quot;Understanding Healthy Cognitive Ageing: Scotland's Unique Contribution&amp;quot; and took place on Saturday 10th September.

This is what Ian said about the event:

&amp;quot;Well&amp;quot; said Disconnected Mind Director Ian Deary, &amp;quot;That's the first time I have been on the same bill as Ken Livingstone and Ruth Davisdson! What an ecclectic programme.&amp;quot; Ian spoke on healthy cognitive ageing to an audience at the Edinburgh Speakers Festival. Of course, the LBC1936's results were highlighted, with a focus on the likely protective factors for cognitive ageing. &amp;quot;There was a middle-aged finalist from this year's Brain of Britain Radio 4 show in the audience&amp;quot;, said Ian, &amp;quot;so that was a good basis from which to explain how crystallised ability ages pretty well.&amp;quot; As usual,the photos of Mr Scott and his brain images went down well with the enthusiastic attendees.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c110c8201a40.37345504</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ccace.ed.ac.uk/node/327</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seniors USP Engagement Activity - Age Scotland (Jenny Ackland) Pre-retirement Training - Dec 2014 - Feb 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7FFC2F1A-AB65-4D32-A751-A0176FCC9DDE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Jenny Ackland and colleague Yolanda Strachan from Age Scotland speaks regularly at Pre-retirement training in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

People had to register to gain access but the event was free and they were able to attend from their desk at work or home rather than travel into the University. The webinar covered the emerging health effects of sedentary behaviour in older people (Skelton), introduced the Seniors USP project and team (Skelton), discussed new research on sedentary behaviour in Stroke Patients (Mead), discussed potential interventions that might help motivate people to break up long periods of sitting (Gray). 106 people attended the webinar live. They ranged from the public (older people, charities working with older people) to professionals (health and social care, companies, leisure industry), researchers (academic and clinical) and policy makers (Scottish Government, Age Platform EC, European Unions EIP AHA). The reach was mostly UK Wide but there were attendees from Poland, Portugal and Greece. Since the live event, the link is available for people to watch On Demand and to date an additional 44 people have viewed the seminar and 60 people have book-marked it. 
It was well advertised on a variety of websites hosted by our Seniors USP Dissemination Group (eg. http://ssscnews.uk.com/events/get-go-sitting-bad-older-people/)

We were contacted by the Coalition of Care and Support Providers Scotland about joining the Dissemination Group. We were asked by Age Scotland to write an article in their quarterly magazine for older people. We were asked if there was going to be any future seminars or webinars that people could attend and this included both organisations (notably NHS boards) and individuals. Considerable Facebook activity on Age Scotland, Go For Gold (Care Inspectorate and BHF NCPAH), World Congress on Active Ageing, Later Life Training, PalTechnologies and Use It or Lose It Facebook sites about how good it was and encouraging people to register and view it on demand afterwards. We were contacted also by Ilenia Gheno, Research Project Manager at AGEPlatformEurope,the European platform for older people, based in Brussels. She invited us to get involved in the platform and to find out more about an EC funded project DOREMI which links the issues of sedentariness with malnutrition and cognitive decline.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54562dcd40ea41.44158084</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://view6.workcast.net/register?pak=1273987634147595</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seniors USP Engagement Activity - GCU (Dawn Skelton) and BHF NCPAH (Bob Laventure) Canadian Physiotherapy Webinar Functional Fitness MOT, 18th Feb 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7C90997-EA30-4688-AC26-75A4D05A57F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Live Webinar (Adobe Connect) to Physiotherapists in Alberta, Canada.

There were also group discussions on the wider topic of sedentary behaviour. The dissemination advisory group consists of health professionals and professionals from other organisations, with a remit for providing care or advice to older adults. The presentations initiated lively debate amongst the attendees, increasing awareness of the topic and its impact.

Members of the dissemination advisory group reported increased understanding of the study and the background of sedentary behaviour. They committed to dissemination of ideas about sedentary behaviour, and the Seniors USP project within and using their organisations. Group members requested additional resources to facilitate that wider dissemination. A number of individuals suggested they would try to change their own behaviour to reduce prolonged sitting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460dbc13e40d9.40096698</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop in physical activity at Balhousie care group - 31.1.17 - Edith Macintosh</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0B671EEC-E84E-4CFF-A272-7A59C18866C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop in physical activity at Balhousie care group for Dementia ambassadors</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a462425329b9.89611332</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seniors USP Engagement Activity - BHF NCPAH (Bob Laventure) Extra Care Annual Conference 16th Sept 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A2F863FB-CAC6-44C9-884C-FD3B6C8F6A34</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk on sedentary behaviour and the project to the Extra Care Annual Conference in Birmingham.

In May 2014 the materials were updated with information on advice to give older people about sedentary behaviour and effects on health and function and in particular the messages that professionals could give to older people to help break up prolonged periods of sitting. Since the rewrite of the resource another 130 professionals have been trained in the FFMOT with the updated information on sedentary behaviour.

Additionally slides were prepared on potential adverse events (skin reaction), frequently asked questions by participants (how to answer them), and common pitfalls of use of the activPAL.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BE458F2C-9B61-46A5-A524-3BF84D7CBC1E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An EU funded project EUROFIT (PI Prof Sally Wyke) requested use of the slides to be adapted for use in their training of their fieldworkers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db226cab5057.86107895</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Seniors USP Training Slides for use of activPAL</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Seniors USP Diary was developed in order to provide an accurate method of self report of sleep time to be able to accurately record sedentary behaviour. This is necessary as without this the activPAL objective monitor will pick up if someone is lying down but not if they are asleep. If they spend time in bed reading or doing other tasks this should be documented as sedentary behaviour and if they are sleeping, as sleep time. The diary was developed by researchers at GCU but then amended following user group feedback (older people) and feedback from the Dissemination Advisory Group, so that ease of use and lack of ambiguity was ensured. The Diary allows people to easily record sleep times for 7 days and also has a section to record self reported sedentary behaviour yesterday (in the middle of the 7 days) and sedentary behaviour in the last week (last 7 days) so that self report can be accurately compared with objective monitoring.</gtr:description><gtr:id>11429200-FBA1-44FE-8A14-DB9044E780F0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Diary has been marginally adapted for use in the EVERLAP Project (funded by the Physiotherapy Research Foundation).

Although not using data collected through the MRC Seniors USP study (yet), the approach was developed to further understand the data that will be collected more rigorously (including accurate sleep time) in our study than in previous large datasets such as NHANES. The associations between time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviors (SB) and physical activity with health are usually studied without taking into account that time is finite during the day, so time spent in each of these behaviors are codependent. Therefore, little is known about the combined effect of time spent in sleep, SB and physical activity, that together constitute a composite whole, on obesity and cardio-metabolic health markers. Cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2005-6 cycle on N = 1937 adults, was undertaken using a compositional analysis paradigm, which accounts for this intrinsic codependence. Time spent in SB, light intensity (LIPA) and moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) was determined from accelerometry and combined with self-reported sleep time to obtain the 24 hour time budget composition. This novel method will be used, alongside traditional methods of analysing sedentary behaviour, to analyse the data gathered from the cohorts in the Seniors USP data to consider determinants of sedentary behaviour.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A2EEB27C-93FE-4377-8852-101CDBE777A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Requests from International Research Groups on further involvement with large existing datasets on physical activity and sedentary behaviour so they can re-analyse data with the compositional approach.

2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d327cabd0931.65375492</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>A novel compositional data analysis
