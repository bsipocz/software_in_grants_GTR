towards a multi-level framework for medium-sized businesses</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J022624/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The question of how to achieve sustained organisational performance is of national and international economic significance. Indeed, it has been predicted that the UK's export market is likely to fall during the next two decades as developing nations increasingly catch up and potentially overtake the UK (The Times, 12 October 2011).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Organisations that embrace innovation rather than remaining entrenched in long-standing ways of working are likely to diminish or even reverse trends in this direction; however, although there is a lot of research focused on the technical aspects of innovation, rather less attention has been devoted to understanding the people management implications that this way of working presents (OECD, 2010; Sparrow, 2010). In this respect, it has been argued that medium-sized businesses (MSBs) are more neglected than either their smaller counterparts or multi-nationals. The suggestion is that renewal in the MSB sector-driven by recognising and championing MSB needs- might yield a GDP of between &amp;pound;20 and &amp;pound;50 billion by 2020 (CBI, 2011). Reflecting the significance of this challenge, our seminar series proposes a multi-level framework to explore people management&amp;nbsp; and organisational innovation. Our focus is MSBs although we envisage that our work will have wide applicability across the business sector.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impact of the seminar series will be on MSBs where it has been identified that there is scope for increasing GDP by between &amp;pound;20 and 50 million over the next decade or so if the sector can be revitalized and more innovation incorporated into the day-to-day functioning of these organizations (CBI, 2011). The MSB sector will be impacted by this research in that the latest thinking is brought to bear on the connection between people management and innovation given the specific demands and challenges that they face, as articulated in the (2011) CBI report: 'Future Champions: Unlocking Growth in the UK's MSBs.' By bringing to the fore best practice together with the latest theoretical ideas, we envisage that we will be able to offer concrete guidance to MSBs about considerations to take into account in order to achieve innovation 'from the bottom up'
 We also envisage an impact on organizations outside the MSB sector who are seeking to be more innovative in response to competitive demands. Smaller companies might gain pertinent insights- for example, about how to foster renewal by drawing on external networks, and any implications that doing so presents for employee skills. Large companies might equally gain a deeper understanding about the multi-level dynamics involved in fostering innovation across employee groups. Effective knowledge exchange, for example, needs to be supported by the implementation of appropriate reward and performance management systems. Employees can be creative to the extent that they exhibit 'domain specific' (Amabile et al., 1996) skills, similar to those acquired through modern apprenticeship or other workplace focused schemes. In sum, organizations interested in designing or re-designing their HR systems in order to precipitate innovation will gain inspiration from the seminar series about implementing practices in a holistic rather than a piecemeal way, and more insight about what options exist to achieve the organizationl outcomes that are required. In seeking to achieve these impacts, our thinking is that synergies often arise across disciplinary boundaries, where related fields have evolved in tandem, offering fruitful and potentially unexpected insights that we envisage will emerge as the seminar series proceeds.
 We suggest that the seminar series will influence policy makers, in several respects. The Conferation of British Industry has suggested that with more attention the MSB sector might play a pivotal role in fueling the UK's economic renaisance against a backdrop of a uncertainty and competitive threat (CBI, 2011). The CIPD has a remit to foster effective people management as a means of enhancing organizational performance, and is increaingly interested in understanding more about the way in which HRM might influence organizational innovation. We see our work as impacting on this professional body. The Department of Business, Innovation and Skills has also made clear its commitment to renewal and growth as a means of dealing with recessionary pressures. Even the OECD (2009) has made central in its manifesto an imperative to support companies in their quest to be innovative. This seminar series speaks to these various policy bodies, offering a focus for leading scholars to explore an under-researched theme and to build a framework that sets out a way forward.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>13919</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aarhus University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Denmark, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Growth through innovation: Aligning Human Capital Management and Growth Tipping Points</gtr:description><gtr:id>5A637965-48D6-4C54-9021-C19B77EB2D20</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d9628cb9d962aa-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>This is a research bid led by Frances Jorgenssen from Aarhus University, Denmark, with Co-Is Helen Shipton from Nottingham Trent University, UK, James Hayton from Warwick Business School, UK and Juani Swart from Bath Management School, UK.

This has been achieved in a number of different ways, as follows:
1. Seminar Series Leaders. As senior academics, the four scholars leading this bid have drawn on the findings of this award in their engagement with the practitioner groups, which comes about through their teaching and executive development activity, focused on senior and aspiring managers in business and public sector organisations, and through their leadership of respective Research Centres. Helen Shipton directs the NBS Centre of People, Innovation and Performance, which communicates insights from HR-related research, drawing heavily on findings that have come about through this seminar series. Paul Sparrow, regularly voted amongst the top ten most influential HR experts in the UK, leads the Centre of Performance-Led HR, and is joint editor with Cary Cooper of the Journal of Management Effectiveness, both of which deal with and help address key challenges facing businesses in the UK and beyond, many of which can be understood through insights generated in the seminars. Pawan Budhwar, as Director of the Aston India Foundation for Applied Research, has been able to draw on insights especially those relating to leadership, learning and training and innovation, not just through his executive development activities in the UK but also through his engagement with senior business leaders in India and elsewhere, to shed light on ways of fostering global economic performance. Alan Brown similarly has a key role through his membership of the Institute of Employment Studies at Warwick University in shaping the practitioner insight and understanding around the themes of the seminar series.
 
2. Seminar series contributors. Scholars participating in the seminars were drawn from many different countries and represented differing levels of seniority in their respective institutions. Each contributor was touched by insights arising from the seminars, in ways captured in the particular chapter in the edited book arising from the series, articulate in their chapters how the seminars informed their engagement with business practitioners. For example, colleagues from Slovenia/ Norway developed a clearer understanding of the people-related challenges of implementing creative ideas, and developed a new model for developing leaders that reflects the challenge of this part of the innovation process (also leading to a new edited book ' Skerlavaj, M., Dysvic, A. &amp;amp; Matej, S. (Eds.). 'Capitalizing on Creativity at Work: Fostering the Implementation of Creative Ideas in Organizations'. London, Edward Elgar Publishing.

3. Direct engagement of practitioners in the ideas. Several new frameworks have been developed to assist practitioners in order to promote economic effectiveness and competitiveness. For example, the PI, Helen Shipton, has developed, alongside one of the series administrators, ex-PhD student, now lecturer, Margarita Nyfoudi, a framework for measuring the effectiveness of competency development and progression within a public sector organization concerned to attract disadvantaged groups to pursue further study at university. Part-time HR students have participated in a research study arising from findings from the series that diagnoses the feelings of employees about work and develops practices to address potential obstacles holding back performance and well-being. 

These are just a few from many examples of the direct effect of the seminar series on the stakeholders whose needs it was designed to address.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0B89C574-F3AF-4EC7-885E-E090F462A730</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460cfa426c6e5.46179879</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was a seminar series intended to promote the cross-fertilization of ideas across academic literatures such as strategic HRM, knowledge exchange, workplace learning and creativity, that have largely involved in tandem. 
Our central question was to explore the way in which effective people management might elicit organizational innovation. this was achieved by:
a. bringing these literatures into a single discussion forum
b. actively searching for synergies across the five sessions
c. encouraging leading scholars as well as junior faculty to look across levels their work.
Compare and contrasting literatures concerned with people management and innovation that a. take an
organizational-level perspective and b. focus primarily on the individual -in order to foster understanding about how
employers might make the best use of people's skills for innovation and any role that managerial practices, learning
cultures and formal or informal education might play.

One finding is that in the UK innovation is seen to flow from scientific experts positioned in discrete areas of the business such as Research &amp;amp; Development. Our research posits an alternative position: that innovation is rather a continuous, multi-level process, involving the application and re-application of existing as well as new scientific knowledge. Innovation occurs across employees at all levels of the business (Gupta et al., 2007). Organizational contexts as well as the wider environment exert influence upon the innovation displayed by individuals and teams. Specifically, findings were as follows:
1. that contexts building employee motivation may be more important for innovation than those fostering capability and skills
2. that, for innovation, apprenticeship training needs to focus on contracting and collaboration rather than functional separation
3. that popular leadership theories such as transformational leadership may inhibit or enable innovation, depending on whether there is an orientation towards knowledge-sharing and collaboration.
4. A clear demand for positioning the debate within an international frame of reference. Innovating through people on a global stage opens new markets, which in turn increases the potential for growth in domestic economies (BIS, 2012) yet presents particular demands for the people involved, which are not well understood. A team of scholars linked with the seminar series are now examining global factors that might influence HRM- Innovation relationships.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The PI. Helen Shipton, was offered and accepted a Professorship at Nottingham Business School in July 2013. This has opened up further opportunities for taking the findings forward. Nottingham Business School has strong links with executive communities through its executive education activities ( Shipton is Head of Doctoral Studies). The Doctorate of Business Administration is one of the largest programmes of its kind, with 150 plus students. 
The other institutions involved in the bid also have extensive networks increasingly utilized insights via the Series. The Centre for Performance-Led HR at Lancaster, through Paul Sparrow, has an international reputation for practically-relevant research and links with a wide group of globally renowned organizations. Bath School of Management, whilst not a partner, became closely involved in the Series through Juani Swart and Yvonne Van Rossenberg and is also one of the leading institutions in the UK for the quality of its research and its commitment to practitioner engagement. Aston University has for several years been at the top or thereabouts of league tables measuring graduate employability, and has an extensive undergraduate business placement scheme that is being be tapped into for the series via Co-I, Pawan Budhwar.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>457D7E29-65A5-414C-836F-0FF3E531F0C9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460c6d5be9739.31432368</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.aston.ac.uk/aston-business-school/research/centres/aston-centre-for-people-and-organisations-</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have data from 2700 employees and managers from 57 organizations located in ten countries.
