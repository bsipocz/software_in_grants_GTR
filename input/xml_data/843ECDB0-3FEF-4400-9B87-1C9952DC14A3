It focusses on the role of discrete material structures associated with a given continuum, in particular on whether or not symmetries of these discrete structures transfer to symmetries of the continuum - this amounts to a generalization of methods of traditional crystallography, where (for example) one states that certain quantities associated with crystal continua have cubic (or tetragonal, or monoclinic, etc.) symmetry. 

 If these symmetries do indeed transfer from small (microstructural) scale to continuum scale, then the mechanics of the continuum may be studied by analytical methods, but it appears that the methods required to determine whether or not this is so are primarily algebraic and geometric. These algebraic and geometric methods have not been used before in this context, so the work to be done is intra-disciplinary. However it is already clear, from preliminary consideration of simple cases, that results from these pure mathematical disciplines may be expressed using language and concepts familiar in applied/engineering studies of crystal defects. Given that the point of departure for the project is itself a very general (new) framework designed to incorporate continuum information at the outset, one envisages that new types of discrete structures with desirable (theoretical) properties will be found (these properties include what might be called 'easy slip' in certain directions determined by the geometry, as well as transfer of symmetry across different scales), and it is an exciting prospect that it might be possible to provide an exhaustive list of low dimensional structures with these properties. Once we have a reasonable amount of information regarding these structures at hand, even if it is not exhaustive, we shall try to see if any real discrete low dimension structures (quasicrystals, graphene .... ) fit naturally into this constitutive framework , so as to provide a modelling option for new materials that have significant potential.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The design of new materials with particular properties can require an understanding of the geometry of the proposed structures and their symmetries, based on the assumption that these geometrical symmetries are transferred from microstructural to continuum scale in a precise way. This particular design requirement aligns with the central aim of the project, which is to generate new types of theoretical discrete defective materials with desirable properties and study their symmetries, and to do so systematically. This is to be enabled by the development of a new and very general continuum model of defective materials, allied to a novel application of mathematical methods and results from differential geometry and Lie group theory.

 There is potential for commercial use of the work (should the research be successful and provide an advance in modelling capability that incorporates a wide class of new low dimensional discrete defective structures), but that use would be some way off even if the results obtained in the course of the project turn out to be genuinely fascinating, and a critical mass of people becomes interested in the interplay between algebra/geometry and continuum mechanics as a consequence.

 Aside from the 'immediate professional circle' of these continuum mechanists carrying out related work (rather a small group), the impact of the work will therefore be felt initially by engineers and materials scientists who are 'users' of those results from continuum mechanics that have resonance with real life material modelling or behaviour, and those from algebra and geometry who deal with applications. The starting point of the work (as stated) is itself a new and general theoretical framework for a model of defective crystal mechanics - dissemination by a targetted programme of meetings/publications will ensure that this new perspective, and the results obtained in the project, reaches these users of continuum mechanics, and that mathematicians interested in applications also learn of this new applied context.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>283368</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>816E99C9-91D8-432D-8398-456CFAC5E525</gtr:id><gtr:title>Discrete structures in continuum descriptions of defective crystals.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical transactions.
