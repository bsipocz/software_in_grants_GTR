The cash and pay day loan market (a well publicised part of HCSTC) is now estimated to be worth &amp;pound;2 billion pounds a year (CMA, 2015). Part of the expansion of the HCSTC market is a shift in how this credit is accessed. In the case of cash and pay day loans, previously, customers would have to phone or call into a branch of a cash or pay day loan company to apply for a loan. With the rise of internet enabled devices and internet access, HCSTC companies have developed websites and mobile applications, where customers can apply through automated systems and receive decisions about the status of their loan very quickly. The ease and speed of using these systems has led to a situation in which 82% of all cash and pay day loans in the UK are applied for and approved online (Competition and Markets Authority, 2015). 
This project seeks to understand how the design of HCSTC websites and applications as well as the spaces and times in which these loans are applied for influence consumers decision making processes when applying for loans. Understanding the relationship between digital interfaces used to access HCSTC and decision making processes associated with these devices is important due to problematic nature of much HCSTC debt. HCSTC is problematic because it provides easy credit to those that can least afford it and is incredibly expensive, with high APR's and penalties for late payment. Indeed recent legislation has been created to regulate the financial terms of parts of the HCSTC market, such as cash and pay day loan companies. This regulation has included limits on the total APR and total cost of penalties for late payment of loans. However, no in-depth academic research has been conducted on:
1. How HCSTC websites and apps (including cash, pay day, guarantor and log book loans) are designed to shape decision making processes around taking a loan.
2. How the design of HCSTC websites and appsencourage, smooth or normalize processes of taking a loan in practice.
3. How the spaces and times where digital devices are used to access these sites and applications might impact these decision making processes in practice. 
This is an important omission, considering that 82% of these loans are accessed via digital interfaces (CMA, 2015).
To investigate this issue, the research uses qualitative methods to study three groups.
1. Website and app designers. This part of the project will investigate the techniques involved in designing HCSTC websites and apps. Through 2 days of observation of designers at the App World and Consumer Credit conferences and 10 interviews the project will understand how designers discuss and reflect upon their own practices in relation to mobile website and app design. Through interviews with designers the project will investigate how websites are designed in an attempt to prime consumer decision making processes regarding taking a loan or buying a product.
2. Staff from debt advice charities, including The Debt Advice Foundation, Citizen's Advice Bureau and financial regulators including The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Through 10 interviews, this part of the project will seek to understand how members of staff from debt advice services understand the role of digital interfaces in shaping their clients practices and whether they give advice regarding the use of digital devices to their clients.
3. HCSTC website and app users in Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. This aspect of the project will seek to understand how people experience and use HCSTC products. Through data gathered in 40 interviews the project will fill the gap in knowledge around how these interfaces influence decision making processes of customers and produce evidence-based recommendations regarding the implications of digital interface design on forms of problem debt enabled by HCSTC.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will benefit a number of organisations by filling important gaps in understanding how digital interfaces and mobile devices are designed to shape users decision making processes and how the intentions of these designs work in practice. The beneficiaries are:

1. Debt advice charities and money advice services in the UK working on issues surrounding debt and money advice. The project will work closely with The Debt Advice Foundation, Citizen's Advice Bureau and Money Matters Service Newcastle (see letters of support attached). The project team will meet with these partners at the beginning of the research and disseminate the findings through training and project workshops (see pathways to impact document). A recommendation report will be written to specifically communicate key advice regarding possible interventions that charities and public sector organisations could make in advising clients about how they access HCSTC. In addition to this, the research team will also create a user friendly 'summary of implication' report and a set of short briefing notes for advisors and staff working in the debt advice sector. These resources will be professionally designed and printed and disseminated through the partners' networks.
Alongside this report, a website will be built and the recommendation reports published there, ensuring that they can be accessed by any interested parties. The website will be supplemented by a professionally designed mobile optimized website that provides interactive elements to highlight how web design techniques are used to prime consumer decision making in relation to HCSTC. The site will be beneficial as a training tool for debt charities and financial organisations (see pathways to impact document for details).
2. Individuals who are vulnerable to problems associated with debt. All participants of the project will be invited to discuss their involvement in the project through confidential feedback sessions. In order to maintain their confidentiality, this will be done over the phone or in person, depending on the wishes of the individual. This discussion would provide participants a right to reply to the research findings, reflect on how they were represented in the research and respond to the recommendations of the report (see activity 3 of pathways to impact document). As discussed in the ethics section, if respondents wish to engage in feedback sessions then information will be provided about independent organisations they can contact if the sessions raise any distressing issues. Reflective responses from the participants will be incorporated into the recommendation report, summary of implications report and briefing notes, which will be made accessible on the project website. An advice page published on the website will also offer short pieces of advice that are drawn from the longer recommendation and summary of implications report, which will be designed to feed back key aspects of the research to help aid practical decision making processes to members of the public. The professionally designed website (discussed above) will also be targeted at HCSTC users and provide interactive information about the problems associated with HCSTC in order to aid responsible decision making. 
3. Financial regulators and governmental and public sector organisations. The recommendations report, summary of implication report and short briefing notes generated in light of the empirical data collected through the project, will be written to directly inform policy makers about the potential policy implications that the research raises and will be professionally designed and produced and disseminated to relevant bodies. The project will also have its own Twitter page that connects and communicates with key actors, such as FCA and CMA. The PI's media office will also construct and disseminate relevant press releases regarding the findings of the research to key organisations and policy makers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>162141</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>84A4CA7D-1215-4A0F-B6DD-D1C24B21363E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unit, vibration, tone: a post-phenomenological method for researching digital interfaces</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>cultural geographies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/573c467c04d3330834993eb7e89f5a05"><gtr:id>573c467c04d3330834993eb7e89f5a05</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ash J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a7ad7ee5e0d00.57947178</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N012666/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CB391BE-87E7-4006-A2C5-43ED9DBA773C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural and Anthrop Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
