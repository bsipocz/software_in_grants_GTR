Network</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I000275/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>'Biography in Changing Times' is a timely and ambitious research network which seeks to build upon recent initiatives in what is an ever expanding field of study, for example, the May 2009 conference at King's College London on 'The Work of Life Writing'. The intention is to establish a formal and informal apparatus by which leading figures in both the writing and the publication of biography can come together to discuss matters of mutual concern, and at the same time maintain a robust exchange of ideas and initiatives via the internet. Thus there will be high-profile, well-respected figures addressing two one-day symposia, as well as a two-day international conference to be held at the network's epicentre, the University of Southampton. The project coordinator, Professor Ray Monk, has not only enjoyed considerable critical success as a biographer, but is also a commentator upon more theoretical aspects of writing biography. Similarly well-qualified are the principal contacts at Southampton's outposts across the network: Edinburgh [Professor Frank Cogliano] and Nottingham [Professor Alex Danchev]. Each of these partner universities will stage a symposium, ensuring the geographical spread appropriate to a national initiative. Critically, however, the network will enjoy an international profile by virtue of, firstly, the distinguished names associated with it, and secondly, a well-publicised website, with interactive features that include a blog, video links, and podcast facilities.\nThe first symposium will focus upon 'Challenges to biography from prevailing intellectual currents', with invited speakers drawn from a range of disciplines, and including Richard Holmes, Roy Foster, Kathryn Hughes, and Adrian Desmond. The second symposium will address 'Challenges to biography in an era of digital revolution, economic downturn, and intellectual audit', with the likes of Hermione Lee, Robert Skidelsky, and Gill Coleridge demonstrating how, in an age of accelerating knowledge transfer, the once sharply contrasting worlds of campus and commerce are now mutually dependent. Michael Holroyd, Miranda Seymour, and Lawrence Goldman illustrate the prominence of authors and editors invited to address the Southampton conference on the theme of 'Can biography survive?'.\nClearly, this is a network which encourages sharp intellectual debate about the very nature of biography, while at the same time addressing key questions regarding not only the genre's place in contemporary society, but more especially its future function and status. Thus a discourse involving both established biographers and a rising generation, whether working freelance or within academia, is crucial; and even more so is a dialogue between practitioners and those who provide an outlet for their work, whether in print, online, or via TV/radio. There is of course a healthy respect for theory and for the evolution of biography across two millennia: fundamental questions are addressed regarding the credence and validity of a text making bold claims to reconstruct in its entirety a life (or, in some cases, lives). Nevertheless, a key purpose of the network is to provide practical support for biographers, young and old - and to ensure a healthy debate on how biography can survive the demands placed upon traditional scholars by a harsh and seemingly unsympathetic 'knowledge economy'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As already noted, the clearest beneficiaries of the network from outside the academic community are those biographers who are freelance writers, and thus not employed in an institution of higher education. While there are obvious advantages in not being beholden to a publicly-funded employer, there is also a downside. Independent writers do not enjoy immediate access to a supportive infrastructure, and are thus denied access to the same facilities as their campus-based peers. Critically, they operate alone, and therefore do not experience regular interaction with colleagues who are either working within the same areas of intellectual inquiry, or are specialising in seemingly unrelated fields and yet may nevertheless provide a fresh, alternative perspective. The network can compensate for the absence of frequent interaction with likeminded individuals, drawn from a diversity of disciplines. As such, it can bridge an artificial divide between university-based scholars and those operating independently. \nNot that the process is all one-way as academics have much to learn from unattached writers. The latter, by virtue of being one-man/woman businesses, tend to be more entrepreneurial and enterprising, as well as being more proactive in terms of workload management: admittedly there are no commitments to teaching and administration, but just how much is the absence of a guaranteed income a spur to writing faster? While most contact between respective camps will occur within the United Kingdom and Ireland (north and south), the intention is that biographers elsewhere in the world will be welcome participants. Thus domestic interaction will eventually be indissoluble from an online global discourse, and the exchange of advice and ideas between freelance and academic biographers will acquire a genuinely international dimension. \nPublic funding bodies will welcome a sharing of best practice if ultimately this generates a measurable outcome. For example, biographers (including campus-based writers), agents, and publishers all stand to gain from a shared understanding of the commercial realities pertinent to catering for a specialist and/or a mass (albeit well-educated) readership. Arguably, cloistered academics need educating in the constraints upon publishers, particularly during a severe economic downturn; while younger writers - both on and off campus - need advice on how to reconcile ambition and integrity. The network's intention to involve distinguished practitioners in their respective fields not only secures the initiative's academic credibility, but it encourages interest among those sections of society who are de facto consumers of biography. For example, given the continuing fascination of TV/radio with biography, and its attraction as subject matter for new media, then the network can act as a portal, channelling producers and researchers towards specialists in the lives of potential subjects; ideally encouraging programme-makers outside public service broadcasting to use biography as a vehicle for tackling complex subjects firmly located within the contemporary world. Similar thinking applies to relevant bodies within central and local government, most obviously galleries and museums; with curators and exhibition organisers encouraged to enter on-line discussion, and to draw upon website material generated by the two symposia and the conference. The same principle applies to any other public or private sector organisations, in that the network's overarching principle is to maximise dissemination of the fresh and challenging ideas which such an ambitious initiative will surely generate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23578</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Edinburgh</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with University of Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:id>C27BB67F-CC87-4DB3-8F07-5F20FC57BF5C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b959a0e2b959a0f6-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>This was a collaboration between Ray Monk and Adrian Smith at the University of Southampton and Frank Cogliano at the University of Edinburgh.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership between the University of Southampton and the University of Nottingham</gtr:description><gtr:id>605F5C3E-53B6-4A5C-9E75-C43B98C9DA09</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b959a34eb959a362-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>A partnership between Adrian Smith and Ray Monk at the University of Southampton and Alex Danchev at teh University of Nottingham.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Oxford Centre for Life-Writing (OCLW)</gtr:department><gtr:description>The Oxford Centre for Life-Writing</gtr:description><gtr:id>7C2BD1D6-A3F2-4473-8190-5E6920CFFEF5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95f164eb95f1662-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Through this partnership we are able to make available to the members of the Oxford Centre for Life-Writing the fruits of this network, including the podcasts and the list of contributors to all our events and to our website.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I000275/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C3FAF999-8402-446C-8A80-016962744E22</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epistemology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AD4F77F-8ADE-4FAE-8B36-11029C350EDE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Lifewriting</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
