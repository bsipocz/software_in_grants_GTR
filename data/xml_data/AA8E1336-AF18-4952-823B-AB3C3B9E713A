Modernist music was condemned as 'degenerate' by the Nazis and forcibly replaced by 'socialist realism' under the Soviets. Sympathetic philosophers and critics have interpreted it as a vital intellectual defence against totalitarianism, yet some American critics have labelled it 'elitist', 'undemocratic', and 'unnatural'. Despite its evident importance, there is little agreement among this range of critics as to what the canon of modernist music actually comprises, or what its aims are.\n\nThis project proposes that modernism is not a single entity but a set of constructions of wildly differing ideologies, and that labelling music as modernist or not is not a neutral aesthetic judgement but always a political act.\n\nDrawing on the philosophy of Slavoj Zizek, it examines the processes leading to the imposition of the various ideologies that use modernism as their object. This analysis is used to expose the seeming paradox that the most widely discussed artistic phenomenon of the 20th century has no fixed body of artistic products, and so no definable identity: it does not 'exist'. The project introduces a psychological focus on modernism's 'quilting points', which is the term given by Jacques Lacan to the psychological symbols that lead to psychotic fixation on something that seems to 'explain everything'. For example, a conspiracy theory might stitch separate items of bad news together into a 'quilt' of covert government scheming which in turn creates an illusion of fixed meaning. Modernism's quilting points reveal fixations on a particular critic's items of derision or fear - communism, fascism, elitism, anti-democratic or anti-American sentiment, etc. - in a trend that is still in process, and still largely unacknowledged today.\n\nThis project offers both a diagnosis of and proposed solution to the problem, which springs in part from what Zizek, following Hegel, would read as the self-negating tautology that 'modernism is modern'. The New Grove article on 'modernism' defines it as music 'adequate to the unique and radical character of the age'. This project instead frames what could be interpreted as a 'psychotic' political question in more properly historical terms: 'what did the artistic products of the 20th century - all of them, whatever aesthetic label we might assign them - contribute to humankind's understanding of its situation in modernity?' \n\nThe project adds to Zizek's philosophy two further radically dissimilar contributions to advance the broader aim of understanding the philosophical and psychological subject in modernity. First, it uses Heidegger's analysis of the modern condition of human being - from Being and Time through to his later work on the 'enframing' that results from the modern interaction with technology and an exploitation of the environment - to develop the notion that music is a mimesis of human temporal existence. Second, it examines the doubly peripheral figure of the 'non-modernist', English composer William Walton, who has never been the focus of a scholarly monograph. Modernism is often defined in terms of what it is not, what it sidelines or replaces, so Walton serves as an example of the kind of negation that is essential for the fluid definition of 'modernism' to stand. Approaching modernism from these three divergent modern perspectives (Heidegger, Zizek, Walton), the project fills out the definition of 20th-C music's contribution to an understanding of modern humanity by examining the historical and existential challenge of postwar destruction in Walton's later music, and the modern deconstruction of gender binaries in his opera, Troilus and Cressida. In this way it broadens and deepens our understanding of modern artistic production while highlighting the ideological dangers of categorization.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The wider beneficiaries of this research include representatives of the commercial private sector, the public sector and charities, and the wider public. Immediate users of the research will be readers of the resulting book and audiences of public talks before and after its publication. The research will stimulate public engagement with an important and recent part of British cultural heritage through public engagement activities including talks and study days. \n\n2013, the centenary of Britten's birth and 30th anniversary of Walton's death, is an ideal moment to focus on postwar British musical culture. The principal mode of public dissemination will be a study day on postwar British musical modernism at Gresham College in 2013, in collaboration with the Institute of Musical Research. It will be free to attend and podcast on the Internet. I shall continue to give individual public addresses around the country (see past record below). I shall work with existing contacts at the Philharmonia and London Symphony Orchestra to arrange further educational events. \n\nAs my research users read the book, public presentations by me and others will continue to shape public understanding of the cultural experience of the twentieth century. The findings of the research may also be distilled in CD notes for commercial recordings, written by me or others.\n\nEconomic and quality-of-life benefits from this research include:\n\n1. Study days encourage the public to support events such as the Windsor Festival (local to my department), which brings economic benefit to British regions; they also enhance the cultural scene in London (my past study days at the British Library and LSO St Luke's were directly connected to concerts there). \n2. The visibility of my output attracts doctoral students (and associated funding) from the UK and EU, and brings broader impact to my department, whose research-led teaching profile also attracts many international students at both UG and PG level. \n3. I maintain a public profile in general interest journals and broadcast media, including film. I contribute to the visibility of British research on the international stage, which brings diverse economic benefit to the country.\n4. The book will provide income for CUP, a registered charity.\n5. Quality of life will be enhanced by increased public engagement with postwar British music (a major and enduringly popular cultural product), and deeper understanding of cultural heritage. \n\nThis research's focus on conceptions of Britishness through the 20th century is of contemporary public interest. The importance of these impacts is therefore that they will feed into the nation's ongoing assessment of its role in the postcolonial world, a question that continues to be especially important in the current global financial and diplomatic situation.\n\nA timescale for these benefits is that talks and broadcasts will appear between now and 2013; there will be further public appearances on this project in subsequent years; and the book's findings should permeate through other scholars into indirect public engagement concerning British identity from 2015 onwards.\n\nTo ensure this benefit from my research, I plan the study day and talks already noted. My experience here is strong and consistent. My second book (2007) distils for a general readership findings of my earlier monograph. It has sold extremely well (for a charitable press) and already has a second edition. In 2007 I led the Philharmonia's study days around the country, 150 years after Elgar's birth, and spoke at an LSO's study day that year. I organized a free, podcast public study day in December 2007. I also contribute to BBC radio and TV (featuring in a 2010 BBC4 film that draws its title and slant from a radical interpretation from my 2007 book, reflecting a revision of public understanding of the composer led</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74097</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Revolutionary Kernel of Reactionary Music</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>46EF9AD1-A795-4772-BBE3-47C262B8D6FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research Colloquium held at the faculty of Music at the University of Oxford.
