Their modular nature means that they can be made in a rational manner under very mild and controlled conditions. The physical properties then emerge as a function of the constituent molecules and any non-covalent intermolecular interactions. Therefore, a molecular approach to materials offers great flexibility to use chemistry to change the constituent molecules in order to tune the physical properties. It is also possible to choose molecules that bring complementary properties to the product, leading to multifunctional materials.

For example, magnetic molecular superconductors have been made based on salts of cationic organochalcogenide molecules (the electrically conducting component) with magnetic counterions.We propose to use this kind of molecular materials route to prepare materials that exhibit Magneto-chiral Anisotropy (MCA). MCA is predicted to appear in materials that are chiral and have significant electrical conductivity. The effect means that their electrical resistance is different depending on the direction of current flow or on the direction of an applied magnetic field. Our method is to prepare conducting ion radical salts where one or both of the ions are chiral. In this pilot study we will synthesise a series of salts combining achiral cations and chiral anions. Our approach will uniquely look at a range of chiral anions, not previously used in this field, which have different topologies and functionality. These anions are designed to promote the expression of chirality in the lattice through intermolecular interactions. A material that exhibits MCA is likely to be important in new electrical devices since the current flow depends on the electron polarisation as induced by a magnetic field, which is the basis of spintronics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>232869</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Circular dichroism (CD) is used in quality control of the protein components of biopharmaceutical products such as the breast cancer drug Herceptin. According to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) there is substantial variation in measurements between instruments. This results from the lack of a suitable standard. We have produced a robust system for calibration of both CD intensity and wavelength. This is currently being used by JascoUK engineers and it is planned to be shipped with new CD instruments (Jasco UK) and to available to other users worldwide. CD instruments can now be calibrated and the uncertainty over the quality of a range of blockbuster drugs can be removed.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>37FA83D9-7527-4419-8519-68D7FB1CED82</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545fea8e504b93.21381745</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Molecular materials are, by definition, made from molecular 'building blocks' in which the molecular origins are clearly present in the final material.

In this pilot study we have made a range of chiral anions as proposed and have used these to make novel chiral assemblies of several conductor components. We have determined the structures of several of these and they indeed have the kinds of molecular arrangements we had hoped i.e. the lattice structure is chiral as a result of through strong intermolecular interactions. Conductivity measurements of these were made as proposed and while the new chiral materials were well-behaved semiconductors this was not enough for us to observe Magneto-chiral Anisotropy (MCA) which is predicted to appear in materials that are chiral and have significant electrical conductivity. 



Along the way we discovered some very interesting new science which we are currently trying to exploit, as follows.



One type of chiral assembly we made is currently the subject of a joint venture between Warwick. Jasco UK, NPL and Starna Scientific. The Circular Dichroism spectrum of our optically pure Co(EDDS) anion has extremely favourable properties for use as a primary standard for these spectrometers. The potential Impact of this is to be able to improve the calibration of all CD spectrometers worldwide and thus make a profound change to the quality of characterisation of biological drugs such as Herceptin. We have secured EPSRC Knowledge Transfer funding to take this forward and are currently making calibration kits which we will take to CD user laboratories in industrial pharmaceutical and biologocal labs and help the users calibrate their machines.



One other type of chiral assembly we have made has the potential to be developed into a completely new type of pharmaceutical product for use in one specific area of human healthcare. The technology is based on a simple but novel approach to the self-assembly of highly stable helical molecules. This breakthrough provides complex systems from simple molecules in one step. A patent was filed on this in July 2010 and we are currently developing collaboration with two pharmaceutical companies as well as researchers in Pharmacy at Bath U and Biology at Leeds U. Our molecules are optically pure, stable in a wide pH range, synthetically versatile and readily synthesised on a large scale. We have secured EPSRC PIA funding to make further steps in realisation of the commercial and societal Impact of this work.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>-</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B37FCF83-2A66-482A-ACA7-7CE67A944604</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8953639239.9609457798caa8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C7FFC707-60E8-4283-88DF-EE7B9786C7A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Self-assembling optically pure Fe(A-B)3 chelates.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/175e8658de25bdfe6dc6fe7c8511ab1d"><gtr:id>175e8658de25bdfe6dc6fe7c8511ab1d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Howson SE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d02b02b6186816</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FC09D69C-2C31-495C-B0AB-7F0DB07A34FF</gtr:id><gtr:title>TTF salts of optically pure cobalt pyridine amidates; detection of soluble assemblies with stoichiometry corresponding to the solid state.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/11750fd06bd4b6303d993ae325aca8c8"><gtr:id>11750fd06bd4b6303d993ae325aca8c8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chmel NP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1477-9226</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d02d02d1e0cca6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>64243E44-1A1F-4434-A945-C54990DB37DA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Iron and Manganese Complexes of 2-Carbonyl Pyrrolyls: Scorpionate Sandwich Anions and Extended Structures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organometallics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0cd97b4a1e149c4f95df16a9cd3b6324"><gtr:id>0cd97b4a1e149c4f95df16a9cd3b6324</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675f0df22769</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>95A2EA2C-DD16-44AA-AF44-9F0A383B43A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Considerations of noise and measurement reproducibility of circular dichroism measurements using Na[CoIII(EDDS)].</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chirality</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/11750fd06bd4b6303d993ae325aca8c8"><gtr:id>11750fd06bd4b6303d993ae325aca8c8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chmel NP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0899-0042</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfc3fc33fcd779</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E151778A-35A6-4E49-9545-37E977399E34</gtr:id><gtr:title>Organic-soluble optically pure anionic metal complexes PPh4[M(III)(S,S-EDDS)].2H2O (M = Fe, Co, Cr).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/11750fd06bd4b6303d993ae325aca8c8"><gtr:id>11750fd06bd4b6303d993ae325aca8c8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chmel NP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1477-9226</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d02c02c5b53907</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F025491/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
