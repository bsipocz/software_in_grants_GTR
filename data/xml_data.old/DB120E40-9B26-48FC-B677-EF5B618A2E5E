They carry out all of the functions that sustain life, from metabolism through replication to the exchange of information between a cell and its environment. They are coded for by a 'blueprint' in the form of the DNA sequence in the genome, which describes how to make them as linear strings of building blocks. In order to function, however, most macromolecules fold into a precise 3D structure, which in turn depends primarily on the sequence of building blocks from which they are made. Knowledge of the molecule's 3D structure allows us both to understand its function, and to design chemicals to interfere with it.

Due to advances in molecular biology, a number of projects, including the Human Genome Project, have led to the determination of the complete DNA sequences of many organisms, from which we can now read the linear blueprints for many macromolecules. As yet, however, the 3D structure cannot be predicted from knowledge of the sequence alone. One way to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; macromolecules, and so to determine their 3D structure, involves initially crystallising the molecule under investigation, and subsequently imaging it with suitable radiation. 

Macromolecules are too small to see with normal light, and so a different approach is required. With an optical microscope we cannot see objects which are smaller than the wavelength of light, roughly 1 millionth of a metre: Atoms are about 1000 times smaller than this. However X-rays have a wavelength about the same as the size of the atoms. For this reason, in order to resolve the atomic detail of macromolecular structure, we image them with X-rays rather than with visible light. The process of imaging the structures of macromolecules that have been crystallised is known as X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography is like using a microscope to magnify objects that are too small to be seen with visible light. Unfortunately X-ray crystallography is complicated because, unlike a microscope, there is no lens system for X-rays and so additional information and complex computation are required to reconstruct the final image. This information may come from known protein structures using the Molecular Replacement (MR) method, or from other sources including Electron Microscopy (EM).

Once the structure is known, it is easier to pinpoint how macromolecules contribute to the living cellular machinery. Pharmaceutical research uses this as the basis for designing drugs to turn the molecules on or off when required. Drugs are designed to interact with the target molecule to either block or promote the chemical processes which they perform within the body. Other applications include protein engineering and carbohydrate engineering.

The aim of this project is to improve the key computational tools needed to extract a 3D structure from X-ray crystallography experiments. It will provide continuing support to a Collaborative Computing Project (CCP4 first established in 1979), which has become one of the leading sources of software for this task. The project will help efficient and effective use to be made of the synchrotrons that make the X-rays that are used in most crystallographic experiments. It will provide more powerful tools to allow users to exploit information from known protein structures when the match to the unknown structure is very poor. It will also automate the use of information from electron microscopy, even when the crystal structure has been distorted by the process of growing the protein crystal. Finally, it will allow structures to be solved, even when poor quality and very small crystals are obtained.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal incorporates five related work packages.

In WP1 we will track synchrotron-collected data through computational structure determination, to find whether the most useful data can be recognised a priori using established or novel metrics of data quality and consistency. We will then enable data collection software to communicate with pipelines and graphics programs to assess when sufficient data have been collected for a given scientific question, and so to prioritise further beamtime usage. We will also communicate extra information about diffraction data to structure determination programs, and so support the statistical models and algorithms being developed in WP4.

WP2 will improve the key MR step of model preparation, especially from diverged, NMR, or ab initio models. One development will be to extend the size limit of ab initio search model generation by exploiting sequence covariance algorithms.

In WP3 we will use our description of electron density maps as a field of control points to better use electron density or atomic models positioned by MR. Restrained manipulation of these points provides a low-order parameterisation of refinement decoupled from atomic models, and therefore suitable for highly diverged atomic models or EM-derived maps. We will extend this approach to characterise local protein mobility without the requirement of TLS for predefinition of rigid groups.

In WP4 we will statistically model non-idealities in experimental data, including non isomorphism, spot overlap, and radiation damage. The resulting models, implemented in REFMAC, will be applied to refinement using data that are annotated by WP1 tools and tracked by WP0.

WP0 will provide the tools to integrate the other WPs. For this, it will create a cloud environment where storage- and compute-resources can be utilised optimally, and where rich information can be passed among beamlines, pipelines, and graphics programs.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Noble (Newcastle University) and Brown (University of Kent) are chairman and chairman elect of CCP4, and have responsibility to their grant-funding agencies (currently BBSRC and MRC) and commercial license holders for delivery of CCP4s software development, maintenance, distribution, and outreach programs. The impact of their respective contributions, therefore, relates to the specific proposed program of work from the co-applicant centres (summarised in each of the relevant grant applictions), to the output of CCP4 as a whole, and to the array of basic and applied macromolecular crystallography (MX) that depends upon CCP4.

MX is an essential enabling technology for the cellular and molecular biosciences, and consequently for UK pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries. UK research councils and research charities have recognised the need for infrastructural support of the discipline, most recently by assigning the last available Phase III slot at the Diamond Light Source (DLS) to a state-of-the-art facility for micro-focus and in situ crystallography for the academic and commercial MX community. In turn, the biotechnological and pharmaceutical science base that is fostered by such investments contributes hugely to the UK economy: in 2010 the pharmaceutical sector provided 67,000 jobs, each contributing &amp;pound;195,000 of GVA, with 25,000 of these positions being in high skill R&amp;amp;D activities (source: http://www.abpi.org.uk). In particular the majority of industrial access to DLS is for MX - amounting to almost 20% of the total user activity in MX.

Collaborative Computational Project 4 (CCP4) was established by the Research Councils in 1979 to promote the development and dissemination of software and best-practice in MX. To achieve this end, it uses Research Council funding to leverage a circa 3x larger commercial income, which it invests in MX training and in software development, maintenance, and distribution. As such, grant funding of CCP4 has the additional impat of strengthening an important interface between UK academic and commercial scientific endeavours.

CCP4s dissemination activities include the hosting of an annual methods-development meeting, attended typically by 400-500 graduate students, young researchers and PIs. It also co-sponsors with the British Crystallographic Association annual week-long graduate summer schools, held alternately in Scotland and England, at which a cohort of 40+ students are intensively trained in current methods in protein crystallography. These two elements, supported primarily by CCP4s commercial license income, serve to keep the UK at the forefront of methods development in this central technique, and ensure that a pool of well-trained, increasingly interdisciplinary scientists are available to apply the technique in academic and/or commercial settings.

The program of work described here, for which Noble and Brown will have ultimate oversight, looks forward to the next stage of the development of MX, to address some of the outstanding obstacles that limit the success and/or efficient application of the technique. By allowing structures to be determined from ever more challenging targets, including membrane proteins and proteins for which sample preparation is inherently difficult, this work will impact directly upon areas of biomedical and otherwise commercial interest. For example, WP0, WP1 and WP4 address the challenge of maximising output from challenging samples, while WP2 tackles the potential applicaiton of ab initio modelling to generate molecular replacement models. These packages address known bottle necks in the determination of structures for membrane proteins, a structural class for which structural information is badly needed (since &amp;gt; 50% of drugs target membrane proteins), but notoriously hard to obtain</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59473</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CCP4 Study Weekend</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4C22CC9-3E4F-4F17-A861-702A251CFFD1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An annual study workshop composed of lectures and interactive demonstrations held in Nottingham over 3 days</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b5323a7362.09567594</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ccp.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CCP4 Study Weekend</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F8562A72-A508-47FD-961E-40F6523BC887</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Software development and crystallographic approaches to solving structures</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e07d92cf47c6.90978117</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>CCP4 is an ongoing BBSRC supported activity that develops, maintains and distributes software for Macromolecular crystallography.

WP0: Our central aim is to develop a cloud-computing infrastructure by which CCP4 software and computational resources can be made available to the community.
Technical specifications for the setup of CCP4 Cloud have been developed in coordination with STFC Scientific Computing Department (SCD). The Cloud will be represented by a system of virtual machines running CCP4 Software through the newly released CCP4 Graphical Interface version 2 (CCP4i2 in CCP4 release 7.0, January 2016), which provides all necessary job and data handling. Cloud virtual machines will be accessible through a common browser without the needs for client software to be installed locally. Therefore, CCP4 Cloud will be accessible on all internet-enabled devices, including mobile platforms. In contrast to other cloud-computing endeavours, CCP4 Cloud will have a persistent storage for every registered user, where original data and the intermediate steps of crystallographic computations will be stored. A further differentiating feature of CCP4 Cloud will be the ability to run computationally expensive jobs on a dedicated computational facility such as the SCARF cluster at STFC/SCD. Finally, there will be data exchange between CCP4 Cloud and data producing facilities, such as beamlines at Diamond Light Source, as well as between local CCP4 setups (e.g. on individual laptops) and the Cloud.

According to specifications developed, a pilot project, supported by the collaboration with SCD, has started. The pilot will implement a Cloud prototype for 20 potential users with the aim to verify the basic principles and technical solutions taken, as well as to collect preliminary users' feedback. Currently we have a working set of Cloud virtual machines with CCP4i2 running on them, which is sufficient for performing computational tasks within virtual machines. A set of dedicated modules for running CPU-intensive jobs on SCARF facility at SCD is currently under development. Work in progress also includes the set up of the persistent user storage and CVMFS system for the centralised CCP4 software repository, accessible for Cloud virtual machines. Accomplishing these tasks will complete 1st stage of the pilot, making it available for preliminary testing and feedback by a chosen set of interested users. Further stages will include implementation of data exchange protocols between Diamond and CCP4 Cloud, development of a Restful API for running CCP4 tasks in the Cloud directly from data producing facilities and users desktops, seamless exchange of CCP4 projects between local and Cloud setups, scaling pilot to higher number of users and ultimately full-scale deployment.

WP1: Our central aim is to allow the results of real-time data analysis to inform experimental decisions on synchrotron beamlines. We have collected and curated test data sets for software development; currently the repository contains ~10TB of data which accounts for ~500 PDB structures. A summer placement student has been recruited for June-September 2016 to link data sets to meta data in a data base (we did not include the student recruitment plan in our ResearchFish update).
We aim to open the database for broader use by the community before the end of the grant. Towards identifying predictive metrics of dataset quality ~100 data sets have been used to test diffraction data quality indicators (I/sigI, CC1/2, Rpim, completeness) in proof-of-principal statistical analysis; a histogram showing success / failure of correct space-group identification in conjunction with these quality indicators has been created and showed promising indicative properties. Coding has also been initiated to implement decision making in existing MX structure-determination pipelines. In addition, we are collaborating closely with MRC LMB (Murshudov and Evans) on model independent evaluation of electron density map quality in order to drive our learning algorithms by assessing success in a robust manner.
An alternative approach to providing Cloud services via a dedicated web-application has also been undertaken. Within this approach, a light-weight framework of computational servers communicating via ordinary http or https protocol is used to maintain distributed computations. The framework is sufficiently abstracted in respect to both content (data and task types it operates on) and hardware (the type and location of computational nodes), which makes it effectively a Cloud setup. Such a framework is useful in the context of collaborative computational projects as it allows for CPU crowd-sourcing: individual idling computers and clusters may be included in the setup at any point. The framework is now being developed and is expected to be released in 2018. The first release will contain all major CCP4 automatic structure solution pipelines, complemented with data import, export and analysis functions.

WP2: Our central aim is to enhance the exploitation of existing structural knowledge and improving ab-initio structure prediction methods to increase the throughput and quality of macromolecular structures determined by X-ray crystallography. Predicted residue contacts derived from evolutionary covariance have been shown to improve ab initio model quality and make larger and more beta-rich proteins tractable to MR structure solution by AMPLE. Alternative strategies for sampling from clusters of ab initio models have been extensively compared: performance benefits can be expected from implementing the best of these. Exploration of AMPLE's performance on transmembrane helical targets is underway. The introduction of new features in Phaser has improved success rates in two molecular replacement pipelines. An improvement in the statistical treatment of ensemble models in Phaser was particularly relevant to AMPLE, whereas the introduction of &amp;quot;gyre&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gimble&amp;quot; refinement (the likelihood equivalents of PC-refinement) were important for Arcimboldo.

WP3: Our central is to develop atomic model refinement against diffraction data produced using multiple crystals. We have already developed a method and corresponding software - LORESTER for reusing information in the PDB about macromolecules under study. Infrastructure for full multiple crystal refinement is now in place and we have already started development of full multi-crystal refinement tools. The developments include revised likelihood function for optimal information transfer from the data to the atomic model. Developed methods are also being applied for atomic modelling of cryo-EM maps when there are multiple classes of maps and corresponding multiple sets of atomic models.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Open access software that can be developed by otyher contributors in fact we have many additional contributors to the software developments funded who have no direct funding from this grant eg SHELX</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C4577190-E5B5-4CD9-966D-2B8676A3654C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546324c0d17723.76699568</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Crystallographic Software Suite for Macromolecular Structure determination</gtr:description><gtr:id>613DF0D0-6EF9-4AE8-BE2A-2ABF566D6C63</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Novel Structures</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54633862f337f7.89506956</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Updated version of CCP4 distribuition Version 6.4</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ccp4.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a new software interface to the CCP4 package that allows a non expert user to solve crystal structures.
