Graphite</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I036354/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Graphite is a key waste form arising from the decommissioning of nuclear reactors such as the UK's Magnox and AGR nuclear power stations. This graphite contains a range of radioactive contaminants generated during its time in the reactor core. The safe disposal of this graphite is dependent on an understanding of how these contaminants behave in a disposal site. One of the most important contaminant associated with reactor graphite is carbon-14, a radioactive variant of the carbon naturally found in the environment. Carbon-14 is important from a risk point of view since it persists in the environment and can become incorporated into food through interaction with plants of microorganisms. Graphite arising from the decommissioning of nuclear reactors is currently destined for deep geological disposal, which involves burying deep underground which is very expensive. The aim of this project is to get a better understanding of how carbon-14 is incorporated into graphite, how it will be released from graphite under deep geological conditions and how the chemistry and microbiology of carbon-14 influence its transport out of a disposal site and its ultimate contact with people. It is hoped that this improved understanding may result in some graphite being disposed of safely to near-surface facilities and that more realistic estimates of the risks associated with graphite disposal can be made.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project represents a step change in current understanding of the technical basis of UK reactor graphite disposal and the disposal of other carbon-14 related waste streams. The empirical data generated will be available for incorporation into carbon-14 gas generation and contaminant transport models employed for dose and risk evaluation. The project will provide (i) a baseline understanding for the distribution of carbon-14 in irradiated reactor graphite and (ii) will subsequently make use of experiments that simulate graphite mobilisation (including carbon-14 partitioning between gas, liquid and solid phases) in post-closure disposal environments and (iii) provide modelling tools to enable the near-field simulation of carbon-14 behaviour and gaseous and aqueous source terms for biosphere assessments. It is anticipated that the knowledge arising from this project would be of direct use to the nuclear industry with specific relevance to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the EA (SEPA), the operators of Magnox reactor sites, EDF Ltd and operators of the LLWR. The project will also be of interest to the scientific consultancy community who serve the nuclear industry through both experimental and modelling activities. It is also anticipated that this project will directly link with associated work across Europe.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>728413</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Liverpool</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Molecular Biology Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>4EF69A43-2E81-4346-AA3A-E3A3874BD59C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This partnership contributed to the following outputs:

This has primarily been through the inclusion of project partners on nuclear industry project teams, expert groups and advisory panels. Examples include participation on an expert group on the fate and transport of hydrogen and C-14 integrated project team meetings both run by Radioactive Waste Management Ltd. In addition project team members have also contributed to projects for LLWR Ltd regarding the disposal of C-14 containing wastes and associated impacts. 
The disposal of C-14 is a significant societal and economic issue for the UK. Consequently the contribution made by the C14-Big project to informing opinion on C-14 disposal has the potential to make a significant impact at a national level. Project outputs with the greatest impact will be: the partitioning of C-14 within specific areas of the graphite, the lack of evidence for a the microbial impacts on C-14 mobility, the upper pH limits for methanogenesis and rates of ISA degradation. All of these outputs have a direct impact on the way C-14 containing waste are assessed and consequently may have significant societal implications. Going forward insights into high pH methane generation generated during this project, are likely to change the way these processes are represented in the computer models used to simulate gas generation in radioactive waste disposal sites. This will have a world wide impact on the modelling of gas generation and radioactive waste disposal.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>75939FA9-C66E-4533-ACC3-AF52EE2C53A6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc8bb8a1ae60.36694000</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings of the project are:
1. Analysis of 49 reactor graphite samples indicated that graphite exposed to fuel channels had a distinct surface deposit micrometers thick (See publications). This surface deposit was enriched in C-14, with a higher concentration measured on samples originating lower in the fuel channels. The remaining C-14 was split between a surface/near sub-surface fraction originating from nitrogen surface complexes, that may be released slowly in a geological disposal facility (GDF), and a second fraction from nitrogen and C-13 precursors located in the graphite lattice that may never be released.
2. A non-radioactive simulant of the surface deposits described above was established using C-12 and C-13 compounds. These simulants have undergone extensive analysis and comparison with actual reactor graphite deposits. This methodology consistently generated a simulant that compared favourably with the actually deposits and which provided an insight into the conditions required for deposit development (See publications). This is important since the surface deposit seen in the reactors is enriched in C-14 and therefore an understanding of its development may assist the decommissioning of these reactors and inform how reactor graphite may behave once disposed of in a GDF.
3. In order to investigate the behavior of C-14 in a GDF microbial microcosms were established under conditions anticipated to occur within such a facility. These were established from both neutral and alkaline environments, maintained under anaerobic conditions and fed on cellulose degradation products which contained Iso-saccharinic acids (ISA). These microcosms degraded ISA and generated methane, a key process in the release of C-14, up to pH 11.0 (See publications). However, when either simulated reactor graphite or actual reactor graphite was incubated in these microcosms there was no evidence of enhanced C-14 release due to microbial activity. In fact, biofilms formed on the graphite surfaces and microbial mediated calcite precipitation occurred over the surface deposits. These results indicate that microbial activity may not directly impact on the release of C-14 from reactor graphite as has previously been thought and in fact biofilm formation may actually modify C-14 release. 
4. A mathematical model was developed (See publications) which integrated current understanding of C-14 release from graphite, with a biogeochemical model able to simulate the microbial processes observed in the microcosms described above. The model included a geosphere model that simulates both aqueous and gaseous releases of C-14 to the environment. Given that the microcosm studies indicated that there was no direct connection between microbial activity and C-14 release the model focused on the indirect impacts associated with the formation/degradation of gases such as hydrogen and methane. It has been suggested that the formation of these gases may entrain C-14 gases and accelerate their transport out of a GDF. This modelling work identified the role of microbial hydrogen consumption as a key controlling factor on C-14 release since it reduces the overall amount of gas generated in a GDF. The microbiology of this process is the subject of follow on research funded by RWM Ltd.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Information regarding the nature and partitioning of C-14 within Magnox reactor graphite provided by the project provides an insight into the evolution of reactor graphite which can inform other researchers since this project has significantly increased the number of actual samples that have been characterized. Understanding how C-14 is partitioned within graphite will also help to reconcile observational studies on C-14 release from graphite with the physical nature of the materials. This will have implications for modelling studies using C-14 release data and may inform discussions regarding reactor decommissioning and the segregation of wastes in a GDF. The C-13 simulant developed during the project may be used by other researchers wishing to study C-14 and reactor graphite without the need to use actual radioactive materials, significantly reducing the costs and risks associated with reactor graphite research. The microbiological component of the project extended our understanding of the upper pH range for methane generation and provided the first degradation rates for ISAs under strictly anaerobic conditions. These observations regarding methane generation and the reaction rates can both be used in modelling studies on gas generation within GDFs. As such this data is useful for radioactive waste management organisations both within UK and worldwide.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6FDF226D-913F-433F-B49B-610D6B02EA4A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5699165416ab71.38054737</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.hud.ac.uk/c14-big/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A model of C-14 transport through the geosphere was developed in the Goldsim simulation package.
