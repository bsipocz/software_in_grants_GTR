The loss such a wide range of crop protection products is of great concern. For example with UK potato production only two synthetic nematicides are still authorised (Vydate and Nemathorin), but these will be subject to major risk based EU reviews in 2017. About 40% of all land used in the UK for potato production is infested with potato cyst nematodes (PCN) at levels where yield is threatened without the use of nematicides. Naturally occurring diallyl polysulfide compounds found in garlic extracts display broad spectrum pesticidal activities and offer a range of interesting leads for new 'green' pesticides.

Towards this goal, ECOspray Ltd have developed environmentally benign pesticide based on garlic extracts as effective treatments for root knot nematode infestations on sports turf. Early field trials demonstrated their promise for use in preventing potato crop damage from PCN. For large scale applications in broad acre crop protection, precision delivery of such pesticides in the localised zone of individual potato plants, will be critical in order to maximise their effectiveness as well as the economy of their use. To address this, Target Set Ltd are designing and engineering back-of-a-tractor side ridge injector systems able to inject liquid pesticides into the soil ridge that immediately surrounds the planted seed potatoes.

This project aims to optimise these side ridge injector protocols and establish their effectiveness as a delivery platform for garlic-derived nematicides (through an extensive range of independent field trials), with the aim of securing regulatory approval of their use to prevent PCN damage in potato crop in the UK, across the EU and further afield.

Within this project, the UEA research team will develop quantitative (laboratory-based) analytical methods that can be used to detect, quantify and chase the fate of individual diallyl polysulfides in complex, agriculturally relevant, soil samples. These methods will be used to guide Target Set in the optimisation of their side-ridge-injector configurations for localised subsoil delivery of polysulfide nematicides. They will also be used to monitor the longevity of soil injected polysulfides during field trials in order to inform ECOspray and Target Set of the best times for repeat nematicide injections. We will also develop qualitative field-based diagnostics that can be used on-site by farmers when this delivery platform is ultimately commercialised. We will also develop methods to increase the yields of the most active diallyl polysufides obtained during the processing and preparation of garlic oils (as well as their synthetic nature-identical equivalents) in order to ensure the nematicide supplies will be able to meet demands when it receives regulatory approval for use in mainstream potato crop protection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Environmental and health concerns have prompted the prohibition or re-evaluation of many synthetic chemical pesticides.

The outputs of this project (ie. a platform for the precise and controlled administration of an environmentally friendly nematicide in potato crops) will benefit farmers, the food industry.

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT?

[A] ECONOMIC BENEFITS (3+ years from now)
IP and the marketing of new products and protocols for mainstream potato crop protection will generate profitability for the commercial and academic partners. The true economic impact will translate across farming/food industries with improved pest control equating to higher and more consistent crop yields. More competitive wholesale/retail prices will ultimately also benefit the consumer.

[B] SOCIETAL BENEFITS (4-5+ years from now)
Increased food security against a backdrop of depleting availability of chemical pesticides. Enhanced confidence in food safety from environmentally benign pesticides.

[C] ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS (5+ years from now)
The scope to replace remaining chemical nematicides with garlic-derived biodegradable alternative will reduce undesirableresidue accumulation in arable farmland and watercourses. Precise placement of these garlic-derived nematicides using SRI technologies will help minimise the quantities of such pesticides that need to be produced (and applied) in order to satisfy the demands of large scale potato crop production. Increased safety and handling for distributors, agricultural operatives and the consumer are also noteworthy benefits.

[D] 5-10 YEARS FROM NOW
The impacts of this projects outputs will initially benefit the UK and the EU, but is highly likely that if successful, these benefits will soon cascade into potato crop production globally. Additional long term impacts include the application of these methods for the delivery of other approved liquid pesticides/nutrients in potato crops as well as reconfiguration/adaptation of the SRI technology for application in other root crop protection regimens (eg. carrots, turnips, sweet potato, sugar beet).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183782</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N004817/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
