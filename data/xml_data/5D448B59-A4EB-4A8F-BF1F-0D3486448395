To advance its genetics and utility, our key objective is to deploy novel Synthetic Biology tools to improve the production of its native enzymes and those from other sources so as to improve the economics of using B. licheniformis for exploitation by commercial end users such as detergent manufacturers, food processes etc. Technologies will be developed for modifying the genome of this bacterium so as to amplify genes encoding useful enzymes, targeting them to specific locations (genomic landing pads) that are validated for high-level and predictable expression, overcoming issues associated with non-targeted integration. Novel tools for genome editing will a) address aspects of the bacterium's metabolism that limit enzyme yield of under conditions found in industrial bioreactors, as identified using systems biology techniques and b) capitalize on in situ protein engineering to improve functionalities of industrial enzymes, including thermotolerance and optimal activity under operating conditions, that important for end users. Success in these areas will reduce the cost and improve the versatility and efficiency of industrial enzyme production by B. licheniformis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Technically, the project combines systems and synthetic biology methods demonstrated in other areas and recently developed tools, alongside more traditional approaches such as biocatalysis, fermentation and process engineering to provide novel and improved upstream and downstream processes for a well proven industrial host. These are further supplemented by theory and modelling to overcome challenges of technology deployment and scale-up, also consistent with competition scope. This project will be a collaboration between a leading European Bacillus research group at Newcastle University and a leading IB SME: Ingenza. Two market-facing customers are primed to commercialise project outcomes. Success will create new jobs at Ingenza, increase the UK's competitiveness in industrial enzyme-mediated bioprocessing, and further enable the UK to deliver on environmental, social and economic benefits of IB. This Industrial Research project combines knowledge and technologies from established disciplines to translate academic research into commercial products and enables rapid and adaptable deployment of an innovative and efficient manufacturing route to a growing and diversifying IB market (i.e. industrial enzymes and biologics) that now exceeds 8% CARG. By improving bioprocess efficiency, the project will reduce dependency on oil, further de-carbonising the UK's industrial base.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>EU IB currently has an turnover of &amp;gt;60 euros bn/yr. The industrial enzymes sector is currently valued at $4.8bn (2013) with an annual growth rate of 8% and a predicted value of $7.1bn by 2018. The world demand for enzymes used in the $7b &amp;quot;biological&amp;quot; laundry detergent market amount to ~10,000 mt/yr, corresponding to a market value of ~$300 million, while the market for biowaste conversion and biofuels is likely to be even larger. Key industrial enzyme market growth constraints directly addressed by this project involve the deployment of novel technologies aimed at: a) improving industrial enzyme yield (productivity and cost efficiency), b) enhancing enzyme function (protein engineering) and c) developing versatile production host plaforms for the next generation of industrial enzymes. Given its expertise in the academic and industrial partners of this project, there is great scope to develop the UK's enzyme production capacity and associated technology/knowledge base through the more effective exploitation of novel production hosts. We aim to revolutionise industrial enzyme production, make more efficient use of production inputs and increase the performance of manufactured outputs to help develop a more sustainable bioeconomy. We will initially achieve this in collaboration with established industrial enzyme producers in emerging markets, while expanding Ingenza's own capacity for industrial enzyme production. The tools and technology so developed will be of value to other industrial enzyme producers and will contribute a reduction in the use of fossil-fuel based processes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>359933</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ingenza Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>I-Bacillus: Adapting Bacillus licheniformis for 21st century IB applications</gtr:description><gtr:id>4836E371-D82D-450E-8A21-AA1A0DC2E2FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is too early to repost outcomes other than the work is financed via a BBSRC/Innovate UK grant</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deadbcb84c80.89062531-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Landing pad technology and industrial formation expertise</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The development of gene transfer, expression and secretion systems for industrial strains of Bacillus</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>for evaluation of strains by companies</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>91234C3A-4B57-4E99-B4DB-FA387B47ACF8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df047ee45209.55829122</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have been able to adapt the plasmid-based Landing Pad identification cassette developed for Bacillus subtilis with the transconjugation gene transfer system of Bacillus licheniformis</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The identification of suitable sites in the chromosome for the expression of recombinant genes can lead to up to 5-fold increases in expression via a gene amplification mechanism</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5ABA7F74-85A4-4A3F-8AC8-F08E3A44F45A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df04b03303a9.55063970</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The application of a conjugation system for the manipulation of the industrial microbe, Bacillus licheniformis</gtr:description><gtr:id>20264B63-5931-4150-93C3-262072771FCE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research tool will facilitate the genetic manipulation of Bacillus licheniformis and other related and difficult to transform bacteria.
