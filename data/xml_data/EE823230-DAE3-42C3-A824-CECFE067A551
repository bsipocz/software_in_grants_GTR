Potentially most disruptive of all quantum technologies is quantum computing, which permits the efficient computation of a variety of problems that are effectively intractable with conventional computers, including searching large databases, advanced materials design in aerospace applications and pharmaceutical drug discovery. The UK is currently taking a leading role in the development of both hardware and software for quantum computing, and has fostered a wide base of expertise in these areas. This project aims to develop a compact vacuum system complete with integrated atomic source for use within ion trap quantum computers. One of the specific challenges on the road to developing a large quantum computer is the high level of engineering required to produce the devices and their subcomponents. This project seeks to develop a key subcomponent for an ion trap quantum computer within an industrial setting using scalable techniques. The successful execution of this project will bolster UK industry's position within the emerging international market in quantum computing and permit the future development of highly integrated systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will establish a vital part of the quantum computing hardware supply chain within the UK, and allow access to markets on an international level, since no company currently offers components of this type. The availability of these systems will enable engineers and researchers both in academia and in industry to advance their work at a faster pace by being able to depend on an off-the-shelf standard product rather than continuing to duplicate this complicated technology. Development of a commercial ion trap vacuum system will pave the way to building quantum computers with 100s of qubits within the next 10 years.

Quantum computers on this scale will already have a large impact on the many areas of society. Ultimately, for example, pharmaceutical drug discovery will be improved with quantum computers by providing a means to predict the efficacy of new drug compounds, which will in turn lead to an increased rate of advance in the medical science and have a corresponding impact on public health and quality of life. Another application for small quantum computers is advanced materials design in aerospace applications, which will lead to more fuel-efficient engines and provide a means to reduce carbon emissions.

In the long term, a demonstration of a quantum computer with 100s of qubits will likely set in motion a step-change in the pace of development of this technology. The proof of concept and demonstration of a commercially successful product will lead to a highly competitive market which will see increased investment from existing multinational computing leaders in addition to the creation of innovating new startups. The UK is well positioned to be a global leader in this industry due to the highly skilled workforce available as a result of the recently-established National Quantum Technologies program. The UK economy will benefit greatly from this high-tech market since it will create jobs not only in the emerging quantum technologies sector, but also in the many sectors which are required to support this market including electronics, manufacturing and the software services industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>55213</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R044562/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
