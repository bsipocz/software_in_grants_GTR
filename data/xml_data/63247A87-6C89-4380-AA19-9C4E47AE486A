Even if Scotland opts to remain within the UK, there may well be moves towards further significant devolution.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Scottish Social Attitudes (SSA) is an annual, independent high quality survey that has tracked the preferences and attitudes of people in Scotland about should be governed ever since the advent of devolution in 1999. This project will exploit this legacy by including a module of 40 questions on the 2012 SSA. The results will be compared with those for previous years to assess whether there has been any significant change in the pattern of attitudes. At the same time the project will examine how far support for independence reflects people?s emotional feelings (such as their sense of Scottish identity) and how far it reflects what they think the material consequences might be (such as its impact on Scotland?s economy). This approach will also be extended to analysis of the basis of support for further devolution.. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>According to the recently retired former Cabinet Secretary, Lord O'Donnell, the possibility that Scotland might opt to leave the UK is, along with the economic and financial crisis, one of the two biggest challenges currently facing the UK government. The decision on whether Scotland will leave the UK will eventually be taken by the general public living north of the border. This project will provide vital evidence on what that public thinks at the outset of the referendum campaign , both identifying what are likely to be the key considerations that eventually persuade people in Scotland to vote either Yes or No and providing information on the extent and basis of public support for further devolution within the framework of the UK. Such information is likely to be regarded as invaluable intelligence by those on all sides of the argument in devising their strategies and policy responses as well as by those organizations whose future could well be significantly affected by the decisions that are eventually taken.

The community of those with a potential interest in the project is thus large and includes:

UK ministers, politicians and campaigners from all parties
Scottish ministers, politicians and campaigners from all parties
Organisers of the Yes Scotland and Better Together referendum campaigns.
UK government civil servants with responsibility for devolution/Scotland
Scottish government civil servants with responsibility for supporting that government's referendum policy
Thank tanks working on devolution policy including Reform Scotland and the Institute for Public Policy Research
Pressure groups with an interest in the future governance of the UK in general and Scotland in particular, including the Electoral Reform Society, the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Scottish Trades Union Council and CBI Scotland.
Businesses located in Scotland, especially those with significant UK-wide operations, including most notably the substantial financial sector based primarily in Edinburgh.
Journalists both north and south of the border, together with journalists from outside the UK
Diplomatic representatives of overseas governments, especially those located in Edinburgh.
Members of the general public with an interest in politics

It should thus come as little surprise that the project potentially has important implications for both the wealth and the culture and the United Kingdom. In so far as the findings of the project inform the campaigning and policy strategies of key participants in the debate, it could materially affect the detail of the options and arguments that are put before the Scottish public and thus perhaps the decision that they eventually take. In so far as the findings inform the decisions made by business about how they should respond to the emerging political environment, this could affect the future economic wellbeing of Scotland and the rest of the UK. Meanwhile, the culture of the UK will be enhanced by advancing media and public understanding of the distinctive political environment that exists in Scotland and of the motivations, including those pertaining to people's sense of identity and culture, that underlie the demand for self-government north of the border.

We would anticipate that much of this impact will arise relatively early on in the lifetime of the project in the wake of the initial efforts to disseminate the results of the project as widely as possible as detailed in the Pathways to Impact statement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49740</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stevenson Trust on Citizenship Lectures</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>67BAFE26-311C-4F9C-873A-879878B3AF57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Post-lecture discussions

It was also the precursor to further research and dissemination activity undertaken as part of two projects funded under the ESRC's research initiative on The Future of the UK and Scotland, viz. a supplementary award to AqMen (ES/K006460/1) and a Scotland Senior Fellowship awarded to Prof. Curtice. (ES/K007149/1). Those later two projects drew in part on the research conducted and data collected for this project, and facilitated the further dissemination of the findings of this project. Meanwhile the survey work for this project was conducted on the same platform as an ESRC project on attitudes to Gaelic (ES/J003352/1) and this created the opportunity examine the link between attitudes towards the language and the constitutional question.

The question of how Scotland should be governed is of course politically contentious. It was not the purpose of this project to generate 'impact' by influencing or changing public opinion on how Scotland should be governed, let alone change the direction of a public policy whose merits was disputed by two governments. Rather it was intended to ensure that impartial information on public attitudes - and what might influence those attitudes - should be available to those within the UK and Scottish governments who were responsible for developing their respective institutions' policy pronouncements, to those campaigning on all sides of the referendum argument, to journalists reporting on the campaign, and to the interested lay public. In this way the project could help inform public policy (and maybe therefore increase its effectiveness) and enhance the quality of pubic discourse about the referendum (and thus the quality of life).

Each of these target audiences was reached by the project. The initial results of the survey were unveiled at a half-day seminar at Edinburgh University in January 2013, accompanied by an extensive press publicity exercise that secured widespread coverage. This event was attended inter alia by representatives of the Scottish National Party and the then nascent Better Together campaign. Meanwhile, the seminar was followed shortly thereafter by private presentations to both UK government and Scottish government civil servants who were working on their respective government's policies on the independence referendum. Subsequently a similar private presentation to help inform their planning for the referendum was given to the staff and commissioners of the Electoral Commission. The results also featured in a report written by Prof. Curtice for a UK Government Office for Science Foresight Project on identities.

Apart from attitudes towards independence the project also examined attitudes towards more devolution. This part of the project was co-sponsored by the Electoral Reform Society and resulted in a briefing that was published in collaboration with the society and was presented at a seminar held in the Scottish Parliament attended by parliamentarians and their staff. This work was followed by further research conducted as part of the two Future of the UK and Scotland projects that formed the basis of a contribution to a submission to the Smith Commission on more devolution that was organized after the referendum by the Future of the UK and Scotland initiative.

The data from this project also featured heavily in a set of research briefings and seminars that were produced and presented in the initial phase of Prof. Curtice's Scotland Senior Fellowship. These seminars, conducted under Chatham House rules, were attended regularly by officials from the two governments, representatives from the official 'Yes' and 'No' campaigns, and diplomats for overseas governments. The briefings became one of the elements of the heavily used whatscotlandthinks.org website that was established as part of Prof. Curtice's Scotland Fellowship. This site also gave lay users access to a facility that enabled them undertake simple crosstabulations of all of the data on attitudes towards how Scotland should be governed that had been collected by Scottish Social Attitudes since 1999, including the data collected as part of this project.

In addition, presentations based in whole or in part on the findings were also given to a wide variety of non-academic audiences including meetings at or of the British Academy, political parties, the Scottish Parliament Festival of Politics, the ESRC (at Portcullis House), the ESRC Festival of Social Science, the University of Edinburgh, a breakfast briefing for Scottish business organisations and directly to a number of private business organisations., Meanwhile a report on attitudes to Gaelic and political autonomy was published by Soillse, with a view to informing policy towards and public debate about the Gaelic language in Scotland.

It is thus evident that the findings of the project reached a wide non-academic audience - and the fact that some of the key players in the referendum campaign came back for more suggests that they found the findings useful. The extent to which they used it in private in developing their campaign strategies is, of course, impossible to tell. But we can show that the findings were noticed and used by key 'stakeholders' in the debate as evidenced by their citation in political speeches and in commentary on the referendum. For example, findings from the survey were cited by the then Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, in his speeches as shown at these two links.
