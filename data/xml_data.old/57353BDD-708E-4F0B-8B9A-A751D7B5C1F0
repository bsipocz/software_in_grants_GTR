The system is to be based on the power line carrier (PLC) technology currently used by TerOpta in their lighting control systems which has the cost and practical benefit of not requiring any additional wiring whilst also not being subject to the constraints and drawbacks of wireless technologies. This in turn will make the product well suited to both new build and refurbishment applications. It will also be well suited to smaller and simpler commercial buildings which would not traditionally have BMS installed. The product is to comprise of a basic energy metering and monitoring layer which is then expandable through the addition of supplementary modules (also to be developed as part of this project) which offer an ability to incorporate control and management functions of varying levels of sophistication depending on the building context and targets. Particular emphasis is to be placed on innovation in simplification i.e. creation of a BMS system that is as low cost, robust and as simple to install and commission as possible.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of this project is to develop an innovative easy to install, flexible, low cost building monitoring and management system infrastructure and interface.

This in turn will make the product well suited to both new build and refurbishment applications.

The product is to comprise of a basic energy metering and monitoring layer which is then expandable through the addition of supplementary modules (also to be developed as part of this project) which offer an ability to incorporate control and management functions of varying levels of sophistication depending on the building context and targets. The existing building stock will remain the greatest users of energy in the built environment over the next century and therefore there is a real need to provide energy efficiency in such buildings by either fabric retrofit and/or new controls. Hence in terms of controls there is a particular emphasis placed on innovation in simplification i.e. creation of a BMS that is as low cost, robust and as simple to install and commission as possible.

The proposed technology can play an important role to control energy use in buildings in a number of ways. Firstly, by providing energy use information to occupiers and owners in order to promote behavioural change, secondly to be able to intelligently control heating, lighting systems etc and finally by producing a system, which is adaptive to the needs of people, climate and individual building performance. By reducing the energy use within buildings this will in turn reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can therefore can therefore contribute to the UK Government's target in cutting CO2 emissions and consequently global environmental protection. Additionally by reducing energy demand this will play a role in mitigating risks associated with energy security. Development of the proposed system also presents a great business opportunity. This system is not limited to any particular building or location and is therefore well suited for use globally. Exploitation of the proposed technology will create a new market for the project industrial partners and relevant manufacture and supply chain. The export of this technology will contribute to the UK economy recovery and growth. In general, the research would benefit companies along the supply chain, the national economy, environment, researchers and their institutions</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79993</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Whilst Building Energy Management Systems have significantly reduced energy demand in large commercial buildings, there remain commercial buildings that are unmonitored or managed.
