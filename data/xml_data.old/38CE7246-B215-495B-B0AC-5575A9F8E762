Our newly developed technology has the capacity to transform and revolutionise the biofuels and aquatic biomass food provision industry. 
Phycofeeds uses freely available solar energy, very hot and pressurised water, heat processing and nutrient recycling in order to convert aquatic waste and biomass into biofuels and nutrient rich waste water. 
Our technology developed with Cranfield University is used to recycle waste, grow algae and use the sun to make fish feed and biofuel. 
We do not use fossil fuels, and we recycle our water for complete sustainability - our technology has not been used before. 
Through this process, Phycofeeds simulates natural energy formation and carbon allocation in a sustainable pathway, as designed, and neatly performed by nature.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project addresses key challenges facing the global energy sector by providing a sustainable alternative biofuel supply using microalgae and wastewater. It proposes the field testing of an innovative solution to the problem of reducing emissions, improving security of energy supply and reducing cost, and producing alternative biofuels for later downstream processing. 
Academic impact
This project will enhance knowledge in microalgae technologies used to generate biofuel using solar energy. A novel research field for solar thermal energy at Cranfield University will be created. In addition, this will further the ongoing relationship between Phycofeeds and Cranfield University, including forecasted student placement (one MSc student per year) and academic publications (i.e. Optic Express, Applied Energy) following project completion. Finally, both UK and international academic groups (i.e. ABSIG (UK), NREL (US)) involved in biofuel and microalgae research and development will profit (new ideas, collaborative work) from this advancement in technology (i.e. Renewable fuels from Algae Boosted by Refinery Process - NREL - 09/02/16).
Environmental Impact
This project will help to reduce reliance on fossil fuels through developing an integrated approach to producing biofuels from microalgae sources, leading to lower emissions and carbon mitigation. An added benefit is the use of wastewater in the biofuel production process. By using microalgae, there is the potential to improve energy supply security and move away from the food versus fuel debate surrounding the use of agricultural land for biofuels. In this early phase and with its small scale production level, this project will positively impact the local environment (Kota, India) on an immediate basis. The amount of waste produced will be reduced, resulting in an increase of recycled community waste material. For a full scale system, the location of waste nutrients, ponds, solar collectors and bio-oil remediation technologies, in close proximity to each other, will reduce both transportation costs and the complexity of commercial equipment layout.
Economic impact 
This project will significantly reduce the cost of energy through direct solar radiation. This technology provides the heat and pressure required for the thermo-conversion of biomass and waste into liquid bio-oil and nutrient-rich aqueous waste outputs. This results in significant cost savings in the biofuel conversion process. The integration of wastewater treatment with algal biomass production processes increases the potential to be more cost effective. An assessment of the revenue generating potential of Phycofeeds and licensing of larger scaled technology worldwide will be carried based on production rate from field tests results. Phycofeeds technology has scope to significantly improve general public households through availability of biofuel and aquafeed. As the project develop and the renewable and alternative energy business sectors expand over the next five years, UK based jobs will be generated.
Social impact 
This project will involve working to improve the livelihoods of communities through energy access for poor households and communities in India. Kota University will benefit from marketing and promotion by outsourced displacement of an innovative UK technology. This project will generate jobs including resellers, manufacturers and maintenance staffs. For the local Rajasthan communities, this project will reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and will help to reduce wastewater and other organic waste sources (i.e. food, garden) viably. The primary target markets for Solar Oil are countries that are closer to the equator (i.e. Asia, Southern Europe) with high level of solar energy. The production of bio-oil to be used as feedstock for bio-fuel production in rural communities (i.e. Middle East and North Africa region) will help improve local energy access.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>40313</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P03103X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1175C1D0-52DD-4F11-A1B8-E080CABC3609</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar Technology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
