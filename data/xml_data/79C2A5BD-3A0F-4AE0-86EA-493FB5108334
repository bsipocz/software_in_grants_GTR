On the one hand, I aim to establish a cultural pre-history of our current assumptions about 'natural' or 'environmental' catastrophes by looking at what I argue is the formative moment of these assumptions - the Victorian nineteenth century. On the other hand, this cultural pre-history is fleshed out by closely reading and analyzing a number of literary, administrative, legal and medical texts mostly written in English by men and women who were directly or indirectly involved with the everyday life of British empire in south Asia. My contention is two-fold; first, that the debates about 'natural' disasters, empire and 'civilization' that emerge from these texts form the core of our contemporary ideas of environmental catastrophe and the practices that we undertake to avert them or minimize their impacts; second, that Victorian imperial literature formed a crucial site for the formation and dissemination of this debate. \nCataclysmic events such as epidemics, famines and floods, occupied a crucial position in the Victorian debates about empire and civilization. The physical and material manifestations of these events were expressed in the deaths of millions of British imperial subjects, the fluctuation and alterations of markets and trade cycles, radical changes of demographics and social relations, and innovations and experiments in medicine, technology, hygiene and governance. The Indian subcontinent in particular, saw the entrenchment of cycles of these events that seemed to keep perfect pace with the growth of British imperial power there. This triggered disturbing questions about the relationship between 'natural' disasters and empire which in turn infiltrated Victorian public discourses and debates about governance, race, class, gender, nature/environment, and culture. Such discussions and debates came to form what might be called the Victorian 'disaster ideology'. Yet, like all ideologies, Victorian 'disaster ideology' contained within it deep-seated contradictions. On the one hand diseases and famines were seen as the rationale of British imperial expansion, since it was argued that it was only the technological and political tools of the empire that could mitigate the effects of these disasters in the 'backward' regions of the world. On the other hand, there was a nagging suspicion that plague, cholera and famines were not 'natural' at all,but produced by the very economic, social, political and cultural mechanisms of empire. \nThis crucial contradiction in the idea of 'natural' disaster was decisively formed in the imperial cultural field, especially in the works of four major British writers of Victorian India - Emily Eden, Rudyard Kipling, Philip Meadows Taylor and Flora Annie Steel. They used famines, diseases and epidemics in their fiction to at once confirm and interrogate the Victorian imperial 'disaster ideology', and in turn to generate disturbances about normative understandings of the 'civilizational' attributes of empire. I read them in conjunction with administrative, legal and 'tropical' medical writings to show how intensive the traffic of ideas was between Victorian literary and non-literary cultures. It is in this traffic of ideas, debates, discussions and cultural forms that the Victorian sense of 'natural' disasters was formed, a sense that we still live with today. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We are surrounded by the talk of 'natural' disasters and 'climate catastrophes', and this seems to reflect and influence the actions and behaviors of ordinary citizens as well as specialists who devise tools of governance. For example, nearly every election manifesto of all the major political parties in the U.K. now carry a mandatory section on 'green policies' or outlines of 'sustainable development' in them. This seems clearly to demonstrate the weight carried by a discourse of 'environment' in the production of consensus in most reasonably functioning democracies in the world today. But these narratives and practices that purport to respond to the perceived threats of an environmental crises seem to enfold a host of contradictions within them. One of the main aims of this project will be to show that our dominant 'popular' as well as specialist conceptions of 'natural' disasters - one of the key elements in the current representation of the 'environment' - and the means to combat or contain these are rooted in the Victorian conceptions of, and debates on these issues. And since the Victorian debates, ideas and practices arose from within the specific context of imperialism and a specific moment in the 'globalization' of historical capital, we need to revisit these connections between empire, 'globalization', and 'natural' disasters in order to reassess our own contemporary understandings of and responses. This project aims to disseminate its findings amongst 'non-specialist' audiences, both within the U.K., and abroad. It will do so by recording a series of podcasts that will be made available commercially across the world, as well as free of charge to universities via the Warwick university podcast programme. Further, the podcasts will be made available free of charge to all the main U.K. political parties - Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrats - as well as small, but influential parties such as the Green party, to generate debates, discussions and reflections about their current policy and governance practices. By doing so, it hopes to be a part of the body of work seeking to make an impact on the levels of public debate, here and elsewhere, and as a result, also on issues of governance and policies geared towards containing or minimizing the perceived impact of 'natural' disasters and 'climate catastrophes'. This exercise in raising the levels of popular as well as specialist awareness of the cultural pre-history of our current perceptions and practices regarding 'environmental crises' and 'natural' disasters seems to be an effective way of enhancing national and global democratic health and wealth. \nI have previously made very successful use of Warwick University's podcast series, 'Thinking Aloud'. The recordings of this series are made available, not only to members of this and other British universities, but also to a global non-specialist audience via Apple's 'i-tunes U' platform. Warwick University thus already has a good record of building communication links with non-specialist beneficiaries. I aim to continue to build on these links by recording and broadcasting a podcast series highlighting the findings of the project. \nThe recording and broadcasting will be a part of my ongoing collaboration with Warwick University's 'new media' capabilities. While I will be providing the content of the recordings, the conducting of the interviews, the recording of the events and the editing of the recordings will be conducted by the Warwick 'Thinking Aloud' team of graduate students. This is a very successful team who have been recording and broadcasting over the past two years, and the editing and recording equipments are provided free of charge by the university itself.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>46184</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings, summarised in the monograph and two articles as well as a series of national and international lectures and seminars, is reaching an audience beyond the traditional academic confines.
