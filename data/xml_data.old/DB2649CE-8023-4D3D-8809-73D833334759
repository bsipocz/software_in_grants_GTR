While the broader subject of contemporary immigration has been the subject of collaborative work between institutions within the UK and elsewhere, there is a noticeable absence of similar projects relating to the history of refugees in twentieth-century Europe. This group of scholars is characterised by an interest in the Spanish Republican exile and a shared desire to engage in a comparative exploration of how refugee migration relates to other forms of migration in Europe over the last century.\n\nThe network will involve meetings and the organisation of three workshops and a conference leading to at least two publications. The first workshop on ''Economic' and 'political' migration: a distinction in need of reconsideration?' will consider the epistemological questions raised by the notions of 'political' and 'economic' migration and their relevance to researching the history of migration practices. As this workshop has been scheduled for April 2008, and therefore before the outcome of the bid will be known, it has not been included in the AHRC costing and finance has been raised from French funding bodies. It will, however, provide the first occasion for all of the members to meet in person for the first time. This workshop will be followed by a meeting of the Steering Committee in June 2008 to organise the publication of papers from the April 2008 Workshop and the confirmation of speakers for the following workshop. \n\nThe remaining meetings of the Steering Group will coincide with the workshops and conference thereby keeping travel and accommodation costs to a minimum. The second workshop entitled 'Memory landscapes and the exile of 1939' will explore how and why Spanish exiles' memories have recently began to feature on the memorial topographies of France, Great Britain and Spain. The conference 'Coming home? Conflict and return migration in twentieth-century Europe' aims to further knowledge into an under-developed area of migration studies. A final workshop will return to epistemological concerns relating to the production of knowledge through the theme of 'From the centre or periphery? Issues in analysing and writing refugees' histories.' \n\nThe results of the network's activities over the period of this bid will be to improve understanding of an under-developed field of immigration history and area studies in Europe. An interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach will produce a better understanding of the creation, maintenance, closure and remembrance of the refugee process which takes into account the roles of state institutions, voluntary associations and the social actors themselves. The collaboration of scholars from Great Britain, France, and Spain with expertise in migration within all of these countries raises exciting possibilities for comparative work and for the dissemination of the network's activities to a broad audience. The project will appeal to the scholarly community working in the field of immigration but also to a broader non-specialist audience interested in refugees' histories and memories in all three of the countries concerned.\n\nThe funding will enable the network to create an administrative base at the University of Southampton, and the organisation of workshops, a conference and meetings to be held at Toulouse, Alicante, Southampton and Glamorgan. Over the longer-term, the network aims to expand its scope by consolidating existing contacts with scholars in Latin America and Eastern Europe which will facilitate understanding of the refugee process on a transatlantic and East-West-East European scale. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18098</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F44C4D12-DECD-40EB-A9F6-B846159350C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coming Home?
