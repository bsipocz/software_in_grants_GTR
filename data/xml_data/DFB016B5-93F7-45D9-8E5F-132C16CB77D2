infrastructure to monitor the state of their assets in an efficient and robust manner, both to
plan for future investment and most importantly to be informed when problems with often
ageing and remote assets are likely to occur. Currently at least 95% of the monitoring
solutions deployed are hard wired and this makes them expensive and often very challenging
to deploy in remote or difficult to access locations.
However the adoption of wireless solutions and the visibility of the benefits case for using
wireless monitoring is growing, and in time expected to account for a significant proportion
of a global and growing market for multi-application monitoring solutions that is worth
billions pounds per annum. Wireless is also expected to unlock new opportunities for
improved asset knowledge and maintenance, provided the monitoring solutions can be shown
to perform in a robust and reliable manner and thus in line with expectations of markets that
are most often highly safety and reliability conscious.
Senceive Ltd a wireless monitoring solutions provider, has had success in early and paid
deployment trials. These indicated clearly the positive benefits of using wireless and
identified a range of potential use cases for the technology platform. However they have also
highlighted a series of limitations that need to be addressed before wide scale adoption will be
feasible.
The project for which SMART support is sought will deliver a prototype, near real-time,
wireless monitoring platform that would be a genuine step change in the provision of credible,
robust, reliable as well as easy to deploy and low cost RCM solutions that primarily addresses
the needs of end-users across global geo-technical and structural asset monitoring applications
in the first instance and which will in time also address needs in the Buildings and Utilities sectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>189100</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">720169</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
