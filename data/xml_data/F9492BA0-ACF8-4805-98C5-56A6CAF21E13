Both involve the application of toxic chemicals to the study of brain function. Astrocytes are very common cells in the brain that have an organising and support function. They are hard to study in isolation because their role is so intimately linked to active brain functions. We have used a novel toxic chemical that selectively destroys astrocytes within the intact brain. This enables us to evaluate how the brain responds to being suddenly deprived of astrocytic support. We have shown that loss of astrocytes leads to a leakage of blood contents into the brain across blood vessels. This effect reverses when astrocytes return, and we are using this reversal to study vascular repair. The other consequence of astrocyte loss is that nerve cells die. We have developed new methods to directly evaluate astrocyte function, and the linkage of this with nerve cell function in the intact brain. We hope that this will enable us to better understand how astrocytes contribute to the normal brain and to repair after injury. Organophosphorus pesticides appear to produce some poorly understood health effects in man, and we are in the process of characterising proteins that we have discovered to be targeted by certain specific organophosphates in the brain, the immune system, and the blood. These brain and immune system proteins may provide better clues to how organophosphates might produce ill health, and the blood protein should provide a better index of the level of human exposure to some pesticides. Other related work on brain proteins is studying how the brain repairs damage to spontaneously aged proteins. This work is relevant to how the brain resists aging.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This programme started within the MRC Toxicology Unit and transferred to Nottingham Medical School in 2002. Work divides into two main areas: astrocytic dysfunction, and target proteins for organophosphates. Astrocytes are responsible for maintaining many vital functions, most of which only develop fully in the intact brain. We have identified 3-chloropropanediol as a highly selective toxic chemical that non-invasively damages only specific glial cells within defined brain stem areas of rodents. This provides a uniquely specific tool with which to study (a) the physiological and biochemical role of astrocytes, (b) the nature of the secondary neuronal death that follows astrocytic loss, and (c) the ways in which the blood-brain barrier breaks down in the absence of astrocytes and then re-forms itself. We have already established that 3-chloropropanediol damage is initiated independently of inflammation, and shown (for the first time) that astrocyte contact is necessary to maintain expression of tight junction proteins in the mature brain. However we have also found that the barrier remains surprisingly capable of excluding higher molecular weight solutes even in the absence of astrocytes. On the return of astrocytes we find that blood-brain barrier recovers, and we are using this to study the factors involved in vascular recovery from damage. We have also developed a novel microdialysis method for measuring astrocyte function in situ. Since many of the factors involved in these glio-vascular-neuronal interactions cannot be modelled in vitro, our well-characterised animal models give us a unique opportunity to understand these factors both at the tissue and molecular levels. Organophosphorus pesticides cause regular human poisonings world-wide. The ill-defined neuropsychological effects that are sometimes associated with low level exposure, putative immunotoxicity, and the spectrum of their protein targets are all poorly understood. We are attacking these areas of uncertainty by better defining the molecular targets of organophosphates. By using a novel high sensitivity radiolabel detection technology we have detected proteins more sensitive to some common OP pesticides than those previously identified. One is acylpeptide hydrolase (ACPH), which may contribute to the anti-Alzheimer action of some organophosphates. We are characterising other previously unrecognised targets that we have found in the brain and immune system. Albumin, previously unrecognised as a high affinity target, may prove useful as a biomarker of exposure to some pesticides. Other work involving similar techniques for the detection of protein targets has focused on the repair of normally aged brain protein by L-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase (PIMT).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2001-09-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>376810</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U955764894</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
