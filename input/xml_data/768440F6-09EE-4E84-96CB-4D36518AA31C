He is professor of economics and public policy in the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford. He is also a director of the International Growth Centre, the co-director of the Centre for the Study of African Economies, and a fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford. From 1998 until 2003 he was the director of the Development Research Group of the World Bank. In 2010 and 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine on its list of top global thinkers. Collier currently serves on the advisory board of Academics Stand Against Poverty (ASAP). In November 2014 Collier was awarded the President's Medal by the British Academy, for &amp;quot;his pioneering contribution in bringing ideas from research in to policy within the field of African economics.&amp;quot;

The Centre for the Study of African Economies is a research centre with researchers at the Department of Economics, the Department for International Development, and the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford. CSAE was established in 1986 and has a long association with St Antony's College. Its mission is to apply
modern research methods to improve economic and social conditions for the poorest societies in the world. Since its establishment, CSAE has become one of the world's leading research centres in development economics and is also the largest research centre within Oxford's Economics Department. The Centre has a strong research reputation, which provides the basis for its increasing involvement in policy debates and other assistance to African government and international organisations. The CSAE annual conference is an internationally renowned event for economists, attracting around 400 delegates, over a third of which are scholars from African countries. CSAE is home to the Journal of African Economies, which is widely circulated in Africa and which funds the annual Visiting Fellowship Programme that enables African academics to spend a term in Oxford and work with colleagues at the Centre. The Centre also publishes a Working Paper Series, operates a programme of lunchtime seminars, and runs several workshops each year. CSAE research is supported by the World Bank; The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR); The Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) through the Growth and Labour Markets in Low Income Countries Programme; and the International Growth Centre.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Following my current and previous work on group identity and group membership on individual behaviour, I have been appointed as a research officer at the Centre for the Study of African Economies to work with Prof. Sir Paul Collier on a new framework which can help shed a new light on why public institutions/organisations are not functioning well in Africa. Central to our research framework is the role of social identities, norms and narratives within social networks in motivating/de-motivating individuals within organisations. We have successfully secured $1.25 millions funding from a U.S.-based private foundation whose mission is to advance the realisation of human rights and social and economic justice for all people. The research programme was commenced in January 2017. Together with Prof. Collier, we have set up a new research Association called the Economic Research on Identity, Norms and Narratives (ERINN), which will draw on the global network of top scholars to develop a viable a coherent empirical research program. The key role of the Association over the three-year grant period is to ensure that this intellectual endeavour will be brought forward and to engage in dialogues with policy practitioners in African countries. A new research program will be established and empirical work will include fieldwork piloting new approaches for organisational reforms which can be rigorously evaluated, establishing new measures of identities, norms, and narratives, how they emerge and evolve within social networks, and designing policy tools can be used to target dysfunctional organisational norms.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Giving a seminar at DFID</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD727179-693E-44BF-B88A-34EAC1D09D4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to give a seminar at the Department of International Development (DFID) on why public organisations do not function as well as they should in Developing Countries. There were around 30 DFID staff attending and 24 attended the video conference from country offices. The aim of this seminar was to discuss the role of social identities, norms and narratives in understanding individual behaviour within organisation which, in turn, affects public service deliveries. The seminar was very well received but it is difficult to quantify and know how the idea might influence public policies within DFID.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca8b349b3a40.35223175</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8B596BC6-7A86-4A38-8C83-CCE7170A5354</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Extremists&amp;quot;: An experimental study of social interactions and other-regarding preferences</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9b4a5a6266900f70241e796c56a8b982"><gtr:id>9b4a5a6266900f70241e796c56a8b982</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crawford, I.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ca70e8c68f66.77615695</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ADF458DE-CAD0-42E6-99F9-852781953133</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is it a norm to favour your own group?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experimental Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2bed0e99dc02ccff417ea0b8f9b215e0"><gtr:id>2bed0e99dc02ccff417ea0b8f9b215e0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harris D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56fe592628af58.62456104</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E8F66AC5-0752-4D7F-B132-2C6DDED849C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>In-group favouritism and out-group discimination in naturally occurring groups</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3e2558d5969d885a1bd196ed12950d35"><gtr:id>3e2558d5969d885a1bd196ed12950d35</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbink, K.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ca73e99f1417.00339296</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I000208/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
