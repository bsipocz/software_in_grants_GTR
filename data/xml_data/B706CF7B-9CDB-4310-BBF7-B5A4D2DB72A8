It is very cost effective, and responsible for 40% of cures, with chemotherapy contributing to 11% and surgery to 49% of cures. The reason why this treatment works is that radiation is toxic for all cells, but tumour cells are generally more sensitive to radiation. (Broadly speaking, the same principle applies to chemotherapy.) Treatment is applied with the aim of killing the tumour before causing too much damage in the healthy tissue of the patient. Therefore, radiotherapy can have serious side effects both shortly after treatment and in the longer term. Moreover, some tumours turn out to be very resistant to radiotherapy. The combination of this tumour resistance and the toxicity for the patient is an important limitation to the successful application of radiotherapy.
To overcome this limitation, we need to understand what are the causes of resistance in the tumours and of sensitivity in the healthy tissue. For instance, we know that tumours that switch on certain genes are protected from radiation; one could design a drug that prevents one of these genes from functioning and so improve the sensitivity of that type of tumours to radiotherapy. On the other hand, we need to understand how radiation causes malfunctioning in the healthy tissue. For instance, we know that specific cell types are particularly sensitive to radiation; identifying the factors that make them sensitive could help to design preventive or corrective treatments for the side effects of radiotherapy.
Research in this area is very active and has been identified as a priority for the UK by the National Cancer Research Institute. This type of research is conducted to some extent using cells in culture dishes. However, before any progress in medical practice takes place, research in whole animals (mostly mice and rats) is necessary, as it is not always the case that observations made with cultured cells are relevant to what happens in real tissues. With the aim of replacing the use of mice and rats, we want to establish the fruit fly as an alternative species where to study radiation sensitivity in whole animals.
Fruit flies are used for research in many areas of biology, as they are cheap and there are many experimental tools available to work with them. Moreover, the genes that provide resistance to radiotherapy in tumours have an equivalent in flies, and therefore knowledge obtained in flies about the functioning of these genes could have applicability in humans. We will focus on the fly intestine because many cancer patients have long-term intestinal side effects due to radiotherapy.
To test whether the fly intestine can be a useful research system to improve radiotherapy in substitution of rodents, we will seek to establish:
(1) whether the side effects of radiotherapy in humans are also mirrored in the fly intestine,
(2) whether we can identify genes and drugs that improve the tolerance of the healthy tissue, and
(3) whether we can create tumour-like cells inside the fly intestine that show increased radio resistance when they switch on the tumour radio resistance genes.
If we establish these observations successfully, this will indicate that the fly intestine can be used effectively in radiotherapy research in substitution of mice and rats, and we will advertise our findings to scientists working in this field, to encourage such replacement.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Radiotherapy is a central component in cancer treatment due to its contribution to cures (40%) and its cost effectiveness. Its efficacy is hampered by the toxicity of radiation and the radio resistance of certain tumours. To overcome these limitations, we need to identify factors of tumour radio-resistance and organismal sensitivity, with the aim of developing treatments that combine radiotherapy with drugs that specifically radio sensitise tumour cells or protect the healthy tissue. This is an active area of research that has been become a priority in cancer research in the UK.
Before progress reaches the translational stage, in vivo evidence is essential in this field, and comes mostly from work on mice and rats. We aim at establishing Drosophila as an in vivo model for radiation research, to serve as Replacement for rodents. We will focus on the intestine, as this organ is highly similar in flies and mammals and it is of high medical relevance in cancer radiotherapy.
To establish the fly intestine as an in vivo model for radiation resistance and tolerance, we need to show that it mimics the basic phenomenology that we want to study. To do that, we will test whether:
(1) the fly displays intestinal malfunction (absorption, epithelial barrier) after irradiation,
(2) different cell types have differential sensitivity to radiation (as is the case in mammals) and the tissue engages in a regenerative response,
(3) we can observe cytoprotective effects after irradiation by either overexpressing in the fly gut factors known to enhance radiation tolerance or feeding flies with a radio-protective drug, and
(4) we can observe, in fly intestines that are genetically mosaic for factors known to confer radiation tolerance in tumours, differential radio-resistance between the mutant and wild type tissue. Establishing these observations would support our proposal that the fly intestine is a good in vivo model for radiation research that can replace the use of rodents.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74255</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/M000710/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
