From many European capitals, we hear incessantly that structural reforms are the key to economic growth. Although this view has led many countries in Europe into implementing reform programs, we still lack a clear understanding of structural reforms. The almost exclusive focus on product and labor market regulations (in detriment to other important reforms such as trade liberalization) has contributed to this dearth of analysis. This project aims to fill this gap. 

The issue of whether structural reforms lead to growth remains controversial. One critique of current policies departs from a New Keynesian interpretation of the low growth experienced in many European countries. Policies that improve the supply side through structural reforms may not automatically lead to more demand and output. Structural reforms may even lead to reduced demand and thus to a more repressed level of economic activity. In this context, one key issue is the timing of the implementation of these reforms. Some reforms, if implemented during a recession, can exacerbate it and, as an unintended side effect, can weaken the political resolve to undertake reforms. Another critique of structural reforms stresses the importance of identifying a range of structural reforms that can boost a country's economic capacity to grow. Structural reforms usually include opening up of the economy to international trade, to international competition and to foreign direct investment, the transfer of state assets to the private sector, product market deregulation and measures aimed at making labour markets more flexible. The current focus on labour market and product market flexibilities is limited and incomplete. Some key lessons from the experience of the &amp;quot;new EU members&amp;quot; (economies that transited from communism to a market-based system) is that there is a comprehensive range of structural reforms (beyond labour and product markets) that needs to be implemented and that the sequencing of reforms matters. Thus the ultimate impact of reforms on economic outcomes is complex. 

Our research has three objectives: 

(1) To construct a panel data set reflecting the extensive reform experience of the 28 EU members between 1990 and 2015. 

(2) To use this data set to provide a study of the determinants of structural reforms. We will analyse the role of initial conditions, institutions and political development, and of economic growth on the dynamics of structural reforms. 

(3) To investigate how structural reforms may affect economic growth and income inequality. This will allow us to shed light on the policy questions formulated earlier, i.e. should policymaking focus on structural reforms to boost growth, and if so, which individual reforms are most beneficial? 

This project will build on three strands of literature. The first one focuses on the determinants of structural reforms. Especially, we will exploit insights from the reform experience of Central and Eastern European countries during their transition in the 1990s. The second one studies the issue of how structural reforms can be used to boost economic growth. It has led to an intense debate on the relative merits of supply side policies against policies aimed at boosting aggregate demand. The third one focuses on the theory and empirics of the relationship between structural reforms and income inequality. 
We will use a new and unique data set and advanced econometric methodologies to tackle various challenges. One key challenging issue is that there may be a two-way causality between structural reforms, on the one hand, and economic growth and income inequality on the other. One key objective of the research project here proposed is to disentangle this complex causal relationship.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has enormous potential policy relevance for our understanding of European Integration because the implementation of structural reforms is widely perceived as a key element to the resolution of the current economic crisis. By analysing both the implementation dynamics of a broad set of reforms (beyond product and labour market regulations) and the impact such reforms have on growth and inequality, this project will deliver an innovative, rich and policy-relevant set of lessons and insights. We anticipate considerable impact on policy makers in EU member countries and European institutions alike. Regarding its expected scientific contribution, the findings of the proposed project will complement and substantially further the ongoing international research effort to better understand the interactions between politics and economics and the role of particular institutional features in promoting economic growth and income distribution.

The target groups for the research findings of this project are academicians, NGOs, journalists, and policy makers and decision makers. The planned dissemination efforts are designed to ensure that the results of this research are made available in such a way as to maximise the chance of influencing future scholarship, policy and practice. 

In the past, all three investigators have had successful experience in terms of both influencing policy and disseminating their research to wider audiences. For example, Professor Paul De Grauwe's research on the Eurozone has influenced monetary policies of the European Central Bank as well as the wider and still on-going policy debates on reforms of Eurozone governance. 

In order to benefit from broader expertise and guidance the proposed research project will have a distinguished Steering Committee and a sequence of project milestones. The main stages in the project timetable are as follows: preparation work occupies the first two months, fieldwork and data collection lasts from month 3 to month 12, analysis phase is from month 13 to 18, and the writing-up stage from month 19 to 24. The Steering Committee will be composed by 12 distinguished experts from academia (UK and abroad) and international development institutions (please also see Pathways to Impact). From these we plan to solicit feedback and criticism throughout the project and crucially at three main project milestones. The first main milestone takes place at the end of the data collection stage when a major exercise in stock taking occurs. Data collected thus far is reviewed, its quality assessed and eventualities considered. This first version of the data set is to be presented in informal meetings to relevant scholars and decision makers with the possibilities for data imputation also discussed. The second milestone is when the first econometric results become available. We plan to informally present these preliminary results at various events. The third proposed key milestone is just before the writing-up stage starts. 

An important element in our impact plan is the dissemination strategy. The proposed project website will enhance the visibility and availability of the panel data set and all the research analysis generated. The project website will publicise and disseminate project activities and outcomes, as well as create a focal point for researchers and policy-makers in the UK and abroad interested in structural reforms. It will provide up-to-date links to research, researchers and resources in this area. This will be accompanied by publication of columns and editorials (summarizing the main findings of the research and distilling their policy implications in ways that potential beneficiaries can understand, value and use) in influential internet sites such as CEPR's voxeu.org, theconversation.com, and Project Syndicate. Our strategy also entails a twitter feed in order to keep users up to date and engaged with activities and findings from the research project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>696170</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P000274/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A4E8C76-15D3-44F2-9A84-72ADCE4DC97D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econometrics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>71E94BA5-333E-4F49-9ECA-60771CC7532E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>085E9E17-60A5-4B2D-B9C5-F950A45872C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law and economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E398036B-8D9A-43E0-BBBA-AF0932365C69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
