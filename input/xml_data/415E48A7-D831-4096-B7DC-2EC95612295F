Result Description: The establishment of the clinical imaging data set, PACS, for research is a key priority for Farr Scotland - and significant volumes of PACS data are currently being collected into a structured, secure environment capable of supporting a breadth of research activities. The September 2016 PACS Sandpit provided attendees with an update on research status and strategy, looking particularly at opportunities for collaboration around the PACS data set. The aims were: 
 - further scoping for some of the initial research that we may wish to do;
 - build a more comprehensive picture of the software tools and systems needed to support that research;
 - explore collaboration (and funding) opportunities

Delegates gained knowledge to build-in forward planning for research exploitation at the earliest stages of technology development and consider new exploitation avenues for existing technologies.

1. Peter Joshi. to facilitate the visit of Tonu Esko, Director of the Estonian Genome Centre, to Edinburgh to further develop their medical informatics collaboration that focuses on:
(a) extension of their homozygosity work from 16 to 41 traits and 100 research groups; (b) extension of their lifespan work from just UK Biobank to &amp;gt;50 research groups; (c) delivery of the first major study of the Y chromosome (Ygen) influences on 39 complex traits, such as height, intelligence, liver and kidney function, visual acuity, fertility, blood lipids and blood sugar levels.

2. Saturnino Luz and the Luxembourg Institute of Health to discuss collaboration on multiple types of &amp;quot;omics&amp;quot; data derived from patients, especially in the application domain of oncology ( with a focus on glioblastomas and lung cancer). Explore potential applications using public data (e.g. TCGA, CCLE, GDSC) as well as other datasets generated in the Luxembourg Institute of Health.
 
3. Riccardo Marioni to visit Professor Simon Lovestone, University of Oxford -to discuss, develop, and refine the selection process for a population of 1,000 middle-aged adults at high genetic risk of dementia for the Dementias Platform UK (DPUK) Biomarkers group (Work Package 6). 
 
4. Pippa Thomson to invite Dr. Simone de Jong, MRC Social Genetic &amp;amp; Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London - to discuss method development, collaborations, replication of previously obtained results and start organizing a workshop on polygenic risk scoring within a family context for the scientific community; novel approaches developing the traditional approaches to incorporate polygenic risk scoring. Both researchers work in psychiatric genetics, with a particular focus on family studies, a key focus of the local Generation Scotland cohort. 
 
5. Arun Kumar to visit the Division of Neonatology, Erasmus University Medical Centre-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands - discussing all existing research into tobacco discouragement and the health of children; techniques in modelling and advanced statistical analysis.
 
6. Valeri Wiegel for discussions with Joan Rodon Modol, Associate Professor, Department of Operations, Innovation and Data Sciences ESADE, Barcelona, Spain - focusing on ePrescribing; Joan has already indicated interest in learning about the process-focussed approach taken by researchers at the Usher Institute.

7. Paul Kawale to meet with Dr Hamish S.F. Fraser at the University of Leeds and the Yorkshire Centre for Health Informatics - to learn about the OpenMRS project which is developing and deploying an open source EMR system now used in more than 50 LMIC, including Malawi; seek insights from Dr Fraser's experience in the implementation, adoption and integration of OpenMRS and compare these with the applicant's own experiences of dealing with the proprietary system AfyaPro.
