The equilibrium positions of atomic nuclei can be routinely determined by the technique of X-ray diffraction. However, this provides only part of the information required by a chemist. In order to develop new medicines and materials it is necessary to understand bonding character and reactivity; these are determined by the energies and spatial distributions of electrons, the so-called &amp;quot;electronic structure&amp;quot;. In order to investigate electronic structure, including the changes it undergoes during a chemical reaction, new probes are required. Whereas photoelectron spectroscopy (the emission of electrons caused by the interaction of molecules with UV light) has long been known to be sensitive to electronic structure, far more intimate details can be obtained by the measurement and analysis of the angles through which the photoelectrons are emitted. The information content of these angular measurements dramatically improves if measurements can be made relative to bonds in individual molecules. This is challenging because free molecules rotate, and measurements are therefore averaged over all the possible molecular orientations. Furthermore, a full characterization requires measurements to be made over a wide energy range. The combination of these requirements has severely limited the scope of most experiments to date. The recent parallel developments of (a) techniques to align molecules in space, and (b) technologies that have enabled the development of a new generation of high energy light sources, is set to revolutionize capabilities, bringing the exciting prospect of observing how electronic structure evolves in time. Here, we propose a series of novel experiments that will combine and exploit these ideas and technologies to develop sensitive probes of evolving electronic structure, and protocols for their implementation and interpretation, facilitating uptake by other groups. The proposed work is timely because of the recent technological developments and the research team is well-placed to advance the state-of-the-art through their expertise in the measurement and interpretation of photoelectron angular distributions and in light source development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Employability
The proposed work will require the PDRAs to work in a variety of different laboratories, enabling them to become highly adaptable and able to achieve goals that are of interest to multiple stakeholders. They will acquire an international outlook attractive to many sectors of employment including academia, government agencies, SMEs and large companies. For much of the duration of this project we will be operating, in parallel, the &amp;quot;ASPIRE&amp;quot; Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network. The defined training opportunities of this network, which will be available to the PDRAs, will provide important transferable skills as well as access to, and liaison with, a number of SMEs. It is through ASPIRE that we will be able to conduct part of the proposed work in collaboration with scientists at Aarhus University. 

2. Public Engagement
The project website that will be developed as part of the project will provide an important role in public understanding of science as well as laying the groundwork for future activities designed to inform the public about research in molecular physics. The PDRAs will develop an appreciation of the importance of public engagement which they will carry with them into future employment, together with an appreciation of the responsible use of social media for this purpose. 

3. Women in Science
A particular emphasis of the engagement activities will be the encouragement of women into scientific occupations through interaction with schoolchildren, and evidence of this will be monitored at a local level (see pathways to impact). 

4. Technology
The experiments conducted at Artemis (RAL) and at the FERMI free electron laser source in Trieste will be developed together with beamline scientists and will contribute to the technical development of the facilities available. Our strong links through ASPIRE to Photek and Roentdek will enable the proposed research to contribute to the development of charged particle detection technology. We aim to disseminate software for the prediction and interpretation of photoelectron images.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>391612</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R010447/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>666CC8F4-4525-49AF-91C1-5675E0C8ADDF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chem.
