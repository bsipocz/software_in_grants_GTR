An engaged democracy is essential for the most overarching social and economic development goals and especially those concerned with poverty reduction and challenging inequalities. It is generally agreed that two keys to progress in social and economic development are: (a) an effective parliament with a strong opposition and (b) active public political participation. And yet in Ethiopia and Bangladesh progress has been made on poverty reduction even though parliamentary scrutiny remains weak.

While political anthropology has greatly enhanced our understanding of how the state is embedded in society, this research will more specifically explore the relationship between parliament, parliamentarians and individuals and groups within the public, posing the overarching question: what makes MPs effective, what roles do they play in poverty reduction and the promoting of equality, how do we measure it and who decides? 

The goal is to explore the extent to which poverty reduction depends on an effective parliament with MPs engaging with the public. The objectives will be: 

1. To undertake a mapping of relationships between parliamentarians and members of the public involved in poverty reduction initiatives within Bangladesh and Ethiopia.
2. To explore the extent and effectiveness of public engagement by parliamentarians in poverty reduction through two case studies: (a) poverty-related policy-making and law-making, (b) constituencies.
3. To assess from the perspectives of various stakeholders the role of parliament and parliamentarians in poverty reduction.
4. To facilitate the development of researchers' capacity in three countries to measure parliamentary effectiveness. 
5. To disseminate findings and recommendations about parliamentary effectiveness in South Asia, Eastern Africa, the UK and globally.

Through mainly qualitative methods of mapping, interviews and observation, using anthropological, gender and actor-oriented approaches, a network of researchers in three countries will provide a unique dataset on relationships at the heart of democratic institutions.

This research is a collaboration between SOAS, Hansard Society and researchers in Ethiopia and Bangladesh. SOAS/Hansard Society will support in-country researchers to carry out this research and disseminate findings widely in their regions and beyond. Our selection of Bangladesh and Ethiopia is based partly on high levels of poverty and inequality, economic and social development being key national objectives for both countries, the key bilateral aid partnerships between Britain and these two countries, and our own experience of both locations. Both countries share a determination and some success in reducing poverty, but weak oppositions within their parliaments, poor representation of women, and narrow engagement between parliamentarians and the public. What are the prospects for democracy in these countries? What does 'good governance' mean from different perspectives and to what extent is it a critical factor in reducing poverty? How can the representation of poor people's interests be improved?

We will produce rigorous research and high quality outputs that are tailored to their audience and influence a wide range of stakeholders through extensive follow-up. The findings will be published in research reports, Good Research Guide, journal articles, blogs, and a monograph on parliament. Dissemination will also be achieved via our extensive network of national and international stakeholders contacts; local, regional and international media; online and through social networks; and through workshops in each of the countries, with a final project dissemination conference and series of meetings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will: (a) enhance the theoretical understanding of how and why public engagement by parliament and parliamentarians affects the progress of poverty reduction and promotion of equality (objectives 1-3); (b) develop research capacity on anthropology, governance and parliamentary studies within Bangladesh and Ethiopia (objective 4); (c) enable development policy-makers, parliamentarians, parliamentary officials and civil society organisations in South Asia, Eastern Africa and the UK to promote more effective parliamentary public engagement (objective 5).

We will hold a series of workshops throughout the project in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and the UK to ground the project in the local context, engage with local stakeholders, and facilitate deeper insight into the issues and findings as the project progresses. These workshops will involve MPs, parliamentary and government officials, research and civil society organisations. The project will conclude with a conference and meetings in London to disseminate the findings to UK and international stakeholders in the policy-making sphere and facilitate discussion about their implications for future policy development. 

Our findings will be disseminated through journal articles (Parliamentary Affairs, the Journal for International Development and Development in Practice), research papers, and conference contributions, and a final monograph. We will form a learning and dissemination link with the Effective States and Inclusive Development Research Centre. Utilising an on-line project blog, electronic newsletter and social media (Twitter, Facebook) we will disseminate the findings on an on-going basis to our extensive international network of research colleagues in the fields of anthropology, development and parliamentary studies as well as governance specialists in aid agencies. In addition to national stakeholders and policy-makers, we will also ensure dissemination to practitioners and campaigners working in bilateral donor agencies (especially FCO, DFID and USAID), civil society and parliamentary monitoring organisations (as examples, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly), as well as multilateral agencies (such as the World Bank Institute, UNDP Governance and Parliamentary Development offices, and UN Women). 

A Good Research Practice Guide will be developed so that other researchers might be encouraged to utilise the research model (particularly the mapping, observation and interviewing of MPs, ethnographic fieldwork tools and gender analysis) and thereby extend the research in their own areas/countries, thus broadening the long-term impact and potential comparative reach of the research in the future. 

Finally, we propose to target a range of outputs at local, regional and international media. We intend to approach the BBC, with whom the Hansard Society has excellent links, with a view to developing a radio programme for the BBC World Service in order to disseminate the findings to the broadest possible audience in the case-study countries and internationally. 

We are confident of our capacity to deliver this extensive impact plan because of our previous record of work in this area and the unique added value created by the combining of our individual reputations and contacts. The PI has a track record of achieving impact; for example by being among the first cadre of ethnographers of development organisations (1998) and by introducing anthropology to the study of parliament (2005). Her twenty-five years of experience in research extends to development, evaluation, inequality, gender and parliament in East Africa, South Asia and the UK. An independent, non-partisan political research and education charity, the Hansard Society has a long record of work on parliamentary reform, and is an international leader in research and innovation around parliamentary public engagement strategies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>404195</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar presentation by Zahir Ahmed at Rajshahi University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7B9F366-1237-4579-A27A-BA6E342076D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Anthropology scholars heard about Zahir Ahmed's experience of researching politicians and undertaking ethnography for the first time in both Parliament and constituencies, informing them about a new approach to political anthropology on elites</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bc379e332ec8.16294206</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation by Emma Crewe on racism in international research at Middlebury College, Vermont, US</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F326B509-CB5C-4B99-9C2C-4374E6A7B44E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 70 scholars and students attended to listen to a panel talk about racism in international development.

She makes the argument that when politicians in those countries fail to at least aspire towards respect for diversity and a fair distribution of resources, or even encourage societal divisions, the risk of conflict in democracies intensify. So, 'a shallow form of democracy, which relies on the structure of Parliament and the apparent magic power of elections but fails to develop adequate processes of representation and justice, is risky.'

Our research findings on Parliaments' public engagement highlighted both commonalities and differences between Bangladesh and Ethiopia. While both face shrinking spaces for opposition and the media, our case studies on law-making and policy-making demonstrate how the influence of civil society in politics and development is stronger in Bangladesh. Despite a woman PM in Bangladesh and 50 reserved seats for women MPs, and an increase from 2% to nearly 40% of women MPs in Ethiopia, women's representation in critical decision-making is circumscribed in both countries. In the engagement between politicians and their constituents in Bangladesh MPs are viewed as a mix of benefactor, patron, and spiritual healer to some, but absent or even villain to others. In Ethiopia, in contrast, the vast majority of MPs have a remote relationship with their constituents, with 93% visiting their constituencies twice a year at most. So the claim by politicians to represent a highly diverse group of people - with different demands and priorities - clearly deserves far more scrutiny and debate in both places but also in other democracies. 

More broadly, both countries highlight the argument made by political anthropologists that democracy can exacerbate divisions in society. Rather than assuming that democracy will necessarily speed up economic development, the social and political risks of violence in 'shallow' democracy (as opposed to the deep democracy conceptualized by Arjun Appadurai) are manifest in both these politically fragile countries. 

The significance of these findings for both Parliamentary strengthening and democratization is that local history and politics have to be taken into account. At the same time, we have some general recommendations, including that a shift is needed from a narrow, top-down and technical approach to institutional strengthening - which focuses on structures, rules and information - in favour of a broader and participatory pursuit of better governance through a multi-pronged strategy with clear priorities. Strengthening the capacity of oversight political institutions, the media and civil society, and creating processes for public dialogue and debate, may be equally, or even more, urgent priorities for capacity building than structural improvements within Parliament.

In countries with limits to the freedom of the press, research can take on an especially important function as a form of political scrutiny. Our researchers have acted as 'critical friends' to Parliament in the same vein as the Hansard Society does in the UK. Our experience is that if you recruit wisely, take account of resource shortages, regularly plan and review, and recognise people's intellectual property rights, then national researchers can produce excellent debates, outputs and advocacy. We have campaigned about the importance of investing in national researchers, including creating opportunities for them to develop their individual and organizational capacity. Further opportunities and support are most urgently needed for young and female researchers in politely fragile countries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Four main audiences are using our findings: 

? Scholars and others in (or interested in) Ethiopia and Bangladesh will benefit from our coalition's participation in 34 engagement activities (conferences, talks, blogs, newspaper articles) and our planned publications. Bloomsbury have invited us to submit a proposal for an edited volume on 'Shallow Democracy' including chapters by all the senior researchers. The coalition has published two journal articles, while we have four book chapters in press, and are drafting four further journal articles, two chapters and one monograph. Scholars are showing interest in our innovative methodological and theoretical approach to studying democracy.
? We have campaigned for the last year for more investment into national research capacity development, especially to DFID, ESRC and AHRC. Several of the Global Challenge Research Fund calls are giving prominence to this goal. One of the chapters in our edited volume will analyse our experience of supporting rather than undermine national researchers.
? We submitted evidence to the International Development Select Committee, who quoted us in their final report; are co-hosting our final conference with the IDSC; and plan to continue supporting national researchers in Africa and Asia to submit evidence to their inquiries.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>55088D6E-E2CB-417D-84A2-FC9D3BAA1B25</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d0a1e47b1830.45219780</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/projects/parliaments-public-engagement-and-poverty-reduction</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>SOAS/Hansard Society submission to the International Development Select Committee's Inquiry on Strengthening Parliaments</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D8930BA5-EB0D-41BB-9858-7D60AC6BB966</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5457833c39b367.41680767</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/parliamentary-strengthening/?type=Written#pnlPublicationFilter</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>As a result of this grant one of the researchers, Professor Zahir Ahmed, has piloted the ethnographic approach to the study of Parliament for the first time in Bangladesh.

In October 2017 a workshop will be convened by Professor Rod Rhodes on this innovative methodology and held at the University of Edinburgh.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c145f9343307.67927043</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Ethnographic approach to the study of Parliament</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/70/1/155/2823720/Ethnography-of-Parliament-Finding-Culture-and</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>114F3829-82C3-4DEE-B467-2D23BEC635E9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stories of political violence in contemporary Bangladesh</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Asian Studies, Journal of Government and Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4bab46521e9704d4a9fa7c2f4c0d94e1"><gtr:id>4bab46521e9704d4a9fa7c2f4c0d94e1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zahir Ahmed</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b9558a72ff17.76815511</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>22D2EFF1-079A-4001-A557-453C0C3D9613</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ethnographies of parliament: culture and uncertainty in shallow democracies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Organizational Ethnography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2d996d00a3da69096c458cd99cb8110d"><gtr:id>2d996d00a3da69096c458cd99cb8110d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crewe E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aaa6f4adad8b4.14167648</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5DE9D865-6E1C-48F5-A180-7389C9B470BA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Women in Governing Institutions in South Asia</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ebbd581ffbb82fbe3a2139dcb7215387"><gtr:id>ebbd581ffbb82fbe3a2139dcb7215387</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ahmed N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a8b00c3209b61.03721961</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5B8207EA-7CC9-4C87-97FA-4742CF127939</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ethnography of Parliament: Finding Culture and Politics Entangled in the Commons and the Lords</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Parliamentary Affairs</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2d996d00a3da69096c458cd99cb8110d"><gtr:id>2d996d00a3da69096c458cd99cb8110d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crewe E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56c4c047a821c7.92573334</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9CA6CB18-ED94-4FE6-A4ED-6BFE342F628C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inclusive Governance in South Asia</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1756b60339c2b292fb26172c28009caa"><gtr:id>1756b60339c2b292fb26172c28009caa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fox R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a8b0101a34f45.47897553</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L005409/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
