Sometimes the immune system can go wrong and attack our own body. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a disease where the immune system attacks the body's organs and joints. Any organ can be affected and the disease can be mild or life threatening. The reasons why the immune system attacks the body's own tissues are unknown.

B cells are immune cells that are known to play an important role in SLE. Immature B cells are known as transitional B cells and these have been shown to be more frequent and to behave differently in SLE compared to health. This may enable them to react abnormally to our own tissues and organs and to develop into mature B cells that can attack them. This may be a cause of SLE. 

It is known that transitional B cells need to travel to certain locations in the body to mature. These locations are known as lymphoid tissues, and are composed of gatherings of many other types of immune cells. Exactly where transitional B cells mature in humans is not known, although research performed by our group suggests this might occur in the gut. To access the gut, transitional B cells need to produce certain proteins on their surface, that act as 'keys'. These are known as homing receptors. One of the homing receptors that B cells need to access the gut is called B7 integrin. Transitional B cell have very high levels of this, suggesting they travel to the gut to mature. 

Our recent research has shown that some patients with SLE have low levels of B7 integrin. We have also seen that these patients lack other important homing receptors known as CD62L and CCR6. This might be an important observation, as if these cells are unable to get into certain tissues, they are likely to mature differently. Also, their migration into these tissues might be a way that the body removes dangerous cells that recognise the bodies own tissues. If this is defective, we suspect these cells stay in the blood and this may increase the risk of them attacking the body. 

Exactly which homing receptors are expressed in human TS cells and how this changes during maturation is not known. Therefore, to understand how this is different in disease, we must first understand it in health. In order to do this we will use a technique called RNA-sequencing, which allows us to determine which homing receptors are produced during normal TS development. We will then use this knowledge to investigate transitional B cells in patients with SLE. To do this we will look more closely at the surface location of the proteins using a technique called 'cyTOF'. This labels individual proteins with heavy metals, which allows the machine to detect whether they are present on the cell surface. 

We think that the pattern of homing receptors on transitional B cells might predict where these cells finally mature and might affect which organs are involved SLE. We will therefore look at the pattern of homing receptors in different groups of SLE patients, dividing them into those whose lupus affects their kidneys, skin and joints. If the pattern of homing receptors matches disease groups, this could be used to predict which organs will be involved when patients are first diagnosed with SLE and may predict what sort of treatments they need.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>1. Perform a deep transcriptomic analysis of transitional and mature naive B cell populations using RNA-sequencing. Cells from healthy donors will be isolated and sequenced to identify expression of a large number of potential homing receptors and how these change through B cell development.
2. Validation of RNA-sequencing by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and flow cytometry on further healthy controls. This will allow quantification of specific lineage associated markers of migration in health, that will allow us to generate a panel of markers to investigate TS cell migratory abnormalities in SLE. 
3. Perform deep phenotypic analysis of transitional B cells in patients with different clinical subtypes of SLE. We hypothesise that different homing receptor phenotypes in SLE may concentrate transitional B cells in abnormal lymphoid compartments, and may predisposed individuals to certain patterns of organ involvement. To investigate this further Time of flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) with a panel of 40 lineage associated markers of maturation and migration will be used to interrogate immature B cell subsets. Patients will be divided into three cohorts according to organ involvement, these being predominant nephritis, arthritis and cutaneous disease. Where differences are seen, these will be confirmed by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR on further SLE patients.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research seeks to investigate the migratory potential of early B cells in order to further elucidate mechanisms of peripheral tolerance and how this might be defective in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and might predispose patients to certain patterns of clinical disease. It therefore will have a wide range of impact on scientists, clinicians, patients and the public.

This research will be of immediate benefit to scientific groups studying early B cell development. The site and nature of transitional B cell development is not understood in humans but remains an important question in human immunobiology, as it would inform us of the mechanisms by which transitional B cells are selected from the periphery and may enhance our understanding of how functionally important B cell subsets are formed in human health. This research would therefore be utilized by a wide range of academic groups that study human B cell development. 

We hypothesise that transitional B cell migration represents a mechanism for their selection from the periphery and represents an important peripheral checkpoint against autoimmunity. This checkpoint is known to be defective in SLE, as well as a number of other autoimmune diseases. Elucidating the mechanisms of transitional B cell selection may bring us closer to understanding this checkpoint, and may enable us to identify one of the earliest defects that occurs in SLE. This knowledge would be utilized by a a wide range of scientists and clinicians who study and treat these SLE. Also, by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms of autoimmunity, this may lead to new targets for immunotherapy. 

Patients with SLE vary significantly in terms of which organ systems are involved and how severely. These factors have important implications for treatment and prognosis. Currently, there is a need for improved disease stratification and prognostication. Our research will investigate whether transitional B cell homing receptor phenotypes correlate with organ involvement in SLE. Were such a correlation to exist, with further research this may also allow us to tailor treatments to certain patients and predict prognosis more accurately. This would enable the practice of personalized medicine and would be highly desirable for the wide range of clinicians that treat SLE, as well as patients that suffer from the condition. 

SLE affects approximately 1 in 1000 of the general population and poses a significant socioeconomic burden on our society. Studies have estimate that the direct costs of diagnosis, monitoring and treating the disease are $33000 per year. The real cost is likely to be much higher when secondary employment losses and associated morbidities are taken into account. The findings of this research may identify novel targets for immunotherapy and methods to tailor treatments and predict prognosis for individual patients. This would be expected to reduce treatment costs and associated morbidity. Although this will not be a direct outcome of the research, we anticipate that clinical validation and prognostication could occur within 5 years of the studies completion. We anticipate this research will therefore be of benefit to patients and could have broad societal impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242905</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R000964/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
