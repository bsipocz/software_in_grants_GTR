In October 2012 a joint study group of House of Commons Commission and House of Lords Committee reported that the historic fabric was in a serious state of decay, and that the current ventilation system were outdated and in need of a complete replacement. This provides the unique opportunity to systematically re-examine the original Victorian stack ventilation system, which had been in use for 90 years before it was replaced with mechanical ventilation and air-conditioning in the 1950s. Previous research by the PI has shown that the historic system was highly sophisticated. Its design had been refined over several decades and followed principles similar to those used in modern naturally ventilated buildings to reduce energy use. It was designed to exploit, as far as possible, the natural stack effect produced by hot air ascending air shafts within the large towers and numerous gothic turrets of the Palace. Yet, how effective was this historic stack system and how far could it be revitalized to provide a sustainable solution to ventilation in the 21st century?

To address this question it will be essential to develop a critical understanding of the historic system. Although various studies have highlighted the importance of the Palace within the wider history of environmental design, to date there is no comprehensive study of the original stack system. This project aims to fill this significant gap in the literature by providing the first in-depth investigation into the design, history and performance of the ventilation, based on a combination of archival research, surveys inside the Palace, and the analysis of historic data collected and scientific studies conducted between 1852 and the 1941. Moreover, it will investigate how it could be restored in conjunction with the restoration, exploiting its potential in providing a sustainable strategy.

Surveys and archival research will be used to reconstruct the original technical arrangements adopted in mid-19th century, to retrace how scientists, working alongside architects and engineers, had developed them, and to explore how the system was modified over its lifetime. Records of historic experiments, eye-witness accounts and measured data the project will be used to explore how scientists had empirically evaluated the performance of the ventilation, e.g in terms of thermal comfort and air quality. Covering a period of 90 years, these records will also be used to undertake an in-depth analysis of how the ventilation had performed historically under a variety of conditions. The gain such insights, however, the project will not only cross different areas within the field of history(e.g. history of science, environmental and architectural history), but also draw on current scientific methods to review the historic evidence from a technical perspective.
 
Over the past 3 years the PI has conducted a pilot study, funded by the Kent Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, and built a partnership with the Palace of Westminster Restoration and Renewal Programme (R&amp;amp;R), a body appointed by the UK government to coordinate the restoration. Recognising the importance of the proposed research to the programme, the Houses of Parliament agreed to be project partner. The research will form a separate work stream within the programme, which will be led by the PI and feed directly into the restoration. In addition to taking part in project meetings at Westminster and the PI will lead a series of workshops and project conferences, bringing together the R&amp;amp;R team and Parliamentary Estate Directorate to develop proposals for re-vitalizing the stack ventilation based on the new insights yielded by the historical research. In addition to demonstrating how historical research can be used to gain insights into past environmental principles, the project aims to show how it can be applied in the context of conservation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The PI aims to actively engage with a range of audiences outside academia, but in particular with professionals in the fields of heritage conservation, architecture and sustainable design:

1) The Palace of Westminster Restoration Programme
The Palace of Westminster has agreed to be a project partner and the proposed research will feed directly into the restoration. Over the past year the PI has given several presentations at Westminster, showing the findings of his previous research on the stack ventilation that had been funded through a small grant from the Kent Institute of Arts and Humanities. Dr Richard Ware, Director of the Palace of Westminster Restoration and Renewal Programme (R&amp;amp;R) and Andy Piper, Lead Mechanical Engineer of the Parliamentary Estate Directorate (PED), recognised the proposed research as highly important to the restoration programme as it will be first study to study the design and evolution of the historic stack ventilation. The proposed research will form a work stream feeding directly into the restoration programme. In addition to attending regular project meetings at Westminster, the PI will lead a series of one-day workshops during which research findings will be presented, peer-reviewed, and ways of restoring the system explored.

2) Professional Bodies
The research will be of particular interest to practitioners and organisations in building conservation, (e.g. English Heritage, National Trust and Prince's Foundation) and in architecture and engineering, including the Royal Institute or British Architects, Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) and the Royal Academy of Engineering. Throughout the project the PI aims to actively engage with these organisations through workshops, lectures and contributions to professional journals. The PI has begun to develop links with several organisations and in recognition of his previous research and has recently been appointed a member of the CIBSE Heritage Group, which has close links to English Heritage. This will give the PI a platform through which to engage with professionals in environmental design and building conservation. The PI will establish a working group that explores how the methodology developed in the context of the Westminster project can be applied in building conservation more widely. Moreover, the research addresses a real educational need. The PI has met engineers at senior level, including Bill Addis (BuroHappold), Jake Hacker (Arup Associates) and Robert Thorne (former director of Alan and Baxters), who highlighted that understanding of historic environmental solutions among engineers was limited. These contacts will form the core of the working group.

3) Other public institutions
During meetings in Westminster it was highlighted that the research would be relevant to other public institutions in London, e.g. Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, Royal Courts of Justice, as these were designed following similar principles of stack ventilation. To explore how the research could be applied to the study and restoration of other public buildings, the PI aims to lead workshop activities engaging these institutions.

4) Wider public impact through the media.
There is a strong popular interest in the Palace of Westminster, the history of science and engineering, and more current issues such as climate change. To make the research more widely accessible the research will be disseminated through the web, social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook) and also newspapers, TV and radio. The aim is to produce one article in a broadsheet newspaper, and more regular contributions in the online newspaper 'The Conversation'. The BBC will be approached with the view of securing interviews and producing a documentary.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>144464</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture at St. Paul's Church, Canterbury</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76FCDA8C-4237-44FE-8522-CD388D09852D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have a public lecture at St. Martin and St. Pauls Church in Canterbury.

The project has two primary aims. The first aim is to gain a critical understanding of the design and technical performance of the stack ventilation system. The second objective is to investigate how far the historic system could be revitalised in the context of the restoration, harnessing its potential in providing a more energy sustainable and efficiency approach to ventilation than fully mechanical systems. Embedded within the Palace of Westminster Restoration and Renewal Programme team (R&amp;amp;R) I have led various initiatives to embed knowledge of the Victorian ventilation system within the design brief. 
Over the past 6 months the focus of my work was on developing and implementing a methodological framework that allowed my research to feed directly into the building survey, which involved the use of 3D point cloud scanning technology to produce a digital model of the Palace. The historic ventilation voids had previously not been included in the survey schedule, which was largely due to the facts that the design and scale of the historic network was previously unknown. The research has provided the new insights required to undertake a systematic survey of the historic voids. A series of pilot scans, focusing on selected air chambers and channels in the House of Lords, have been conducted by the surveyors, These have demonstrate that the technology is capable of capturing these voids, including those that are difficult to access.

The research has also led to the re-utilisation of the historic ventilation system being made a formal requirements within the design brief for refurbishment. Working the R&amp;amp;R lead engineer, Robert Stewart, I have written sections for the design brief that outline a series of alternative scenarios for re-utilising this historic ventilation infrastructure. These scenarios are to be investigated by the external team of architects to be appointed later in the year. I have also produce a 150 page report, which, consolidating the findings of architectural research and building surveys, provides a general overview of the historic system. This forms part of a series of lead documents produced with the aim of providing the architects with the foundational knowledge required for the project. In this case it. My role, at the next stage, will be to give a series of workshops, talk and site tours to give the architects a sound introduction to the historic system. 

Over the last six months I have also led several workshop with practitioners in the field of sustainable design and building conservation to explore how the research methodologies that I have developed in the context of the Palace of Westminster could be applied to building conservation and sustainable environmental design more widely. These workshop will continue over the next twelve months and the aim is to develop a paper outlining new design practices that incorporate the study of historic environmental principles.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>11F13D48-9EAC-41E2-BAB6-D910F6A535DE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c9acf6802490.91843262</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has only started in late June 2016 and it too early to report about research findings.
