Many of these plant derived compounds have also found their way into modern drug use for example morphine and codeine for pain relief, atropine to increase heart rate and for irritable bowel syndrome, vinblastine to treat cancers and quinine for malaria. There are over 14,000 alkaloid chemical structures known and these represent a wealth of potential biological activity. However many of these alkaloids occur in small amounts or in plants that are rare or only grow in parts of the world that are difficult to access. The pathways that plants use to synthesise alkaloids are often long with many biosynthetic steps. There are some key intermediate compounds that are common to many plant alkaloid pathways and the complexity of alkaloid structures comes from the different later steps in the pathways that different plants have. It would be of great benefit to be able to make some of these key intermediate alkaloid compounds in a more controlled way and to be able to modify these alkaloid structures using enzymes or chemistry. In this way novel biologically active drugs could be found. The pathways for the synthesis of several alkaloids have begun to be determined but many of the steps for some of the more complex alkaloids are still unknown. In the last few years researchers have begun to isolate the enzymes (and their genes) for some of the key steps in the synthesis of some alkaloids. Some of these enzymes carry out very important steps such as the joining together of rather simple compounds derived from simple amino acids. We intend to use the techniques of whole gene synthesis, synthetic biology and pathway design to make some of these key alkaloid synthesising enzymes and put them into a laboratory bacterium. In this way we can combine different plant based and bacterial enzymes and build synthetic pathways for the creation of new chemical compounds that could be screened for useful medicinal activities. By having the pathways in bacteria we would be able to generate them in a reproducible way using a renewable resource and not be dependant on the growth of difficult or rare plants. In addition, extensive chemical transformations using methods with high environmental impact would not be required which are currently used to synthesise such isoquinolines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We aim to construct recombinant Escherichia coli carrying synthetic engineered pathways for the production of alkaloids of the isoquinolines class. To do this we will use synthetic genes for the main coupling enzyme from the benzylisoquinoline (BIA) pathway, the norcoclaurine synthase (NCS). There are two types of NCS and these genes will be made synthetically and expressed in E. coli. The NCS joins dopamine to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to make (S)-norcoclaurine. The substrate specificity of these two classes of wild type enzyme will be determined towards a range of aromatic amines such as substituted dopamines and tryptamines. The specificity towards a range of aldehydes including modified phenylacetaldehyes (4-OH, 3-OH, 3,4-diOH, halogen, amino etc), indoleacetaldehyde and aliphatic or cyclic aldehydes will be established. The NCS enzymes will be tested and used as stand alone enzymes for the coupling of the amine and aldehyde. Mutant NCS enzymes will be made with the ability to accept different and non-natural amines and aldehydes. The structures of the compounds formed by the native and mutant NCS enzymes will be determined using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. We will also construct the pathways which will enable E. coli to synthesise the dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde for the NCS and to combine these pathways to make strains which will make (S)-norcoclaurine de novo. Using synthetic genes for many of these feeder pathway components will allow different aromatic aldehydes to be made in vivo. E. coli expressing only one or the other pathway for the NCS substrates will allow non-natural amines or aldehydes to be fed to strains which carry pathways for the other NCS substrate and the NCS. Cytochrome P450 enzymes systems which have previously been constructed will be expressed together with NCS enzymes and the feeder pathways plus NCS. In this way we aim to build strains which can make diverse alkaloids of the isoquinoline class.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>713221</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Synthetic plant norcoclaurine synthase enzymes and mutants of these enzymes that can synthesise novel bioactive benzylisoquinoline alkaloids have been developed. Together with a fluorescence assay developed in the project we now have the means to rapidly make, screen and develop novel compounds.



Two new chemical synthetic methods for making benzylisoquinoline and pyridinium alkaloids have been developed and one of these methods is being patented. Some of the compounds from these new synthetic methods have antimicrobial activity against bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and are the subject of a second patent.



A new mechanism for the norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) enzyme has been proposed and has been published. The new mechanism leads to the development of better NCS enzymes, which we have identified, for making new bioactive compounds.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The generation of new classes of compounds using the methods that we have developed could be used for making new pharmaceutical drugs for antimicrobials and for other pharmaceutical research and development areas. Some members of the new BIAs made by the phosphate reaction are able to inhibit Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a collaboration with researchers at Birkbeck College we have shown good anti-mycobacterial activity and low activity to mouse macrophages showing that these new reagents may have utility in treating TB infections. A draft publication has been prepared and we are seeking patent protection prior to submission.



A second phosphate based reaction was discovered as a side reaction when the phosphate reaction is carried out at a high temperature. This reaction produces different non-BIA structures that are novel and we have tested the antimicrobial activity and established they have antibacterial activity towards Gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staph. carnosus and Micrococcus luteus. We have a draft publication and are currently seeking patent protection for the chemical method, new reagents and bioactivities of the compounds.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C146A773-BAED-4FB6-A1DB-A1DE71A87027</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6294643149.0542767772fea4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EE8B0E5C-79A1-4533-8EF1-C9B439AB07D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Micromolar colorimetric detection of 2-hydroxy ketones with the water-soluble tetrazolium WST-1.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Analytical biochemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bfcce674e6836bf04adf97d5f77be2c9"><gtr:id>bfcce674e6836bf04adf97d5f77be2c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bommer M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0003-2697</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d74ca6ab3a6.76947149</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>006A6667-444E-4118-BF48-F88AD78A7BB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tetrahydroisoquinolines affect the whole-cell phenotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by inhibiting the ATP-dependent MurE ligase.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c255ff65577bfc91cef459008b7f3237"><gtr:id>c255ff65577bfc91cef459008b7f3237</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guzman JD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-7453</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675df6e0b3ca</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9FAD0F3B-8E3A-4F81-9297-AC2CEAC40F6B</gtr:id><gtr:title>One-Pot Phosphate-Mediated Synthesis of Novel 1,3,5-Trisubstituted Pyridinium Salts: A New Family of S. aureus Inhibitors.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/12a99e9e43525209b857e7cb1e5708d3"><gtr:id>12a99e9e43525209b857e7cb1e5708d3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pesnot T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1420-3049</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcd8d69cac4.28122616</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1778DCDA-7CAD-4639-9466-E3996B420521</gtr:id><gtr:title>One-pot triangular chemoenzymatic cascades for the syntheses of chiral alkaloids from dopamine</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Green Chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5e78584517c039633e23658a7a4d8319"><gtr:id>5e78584517c039633e23658a7a4d8319</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lichman B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f94b94bb4893fe</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D4A78FA8-030A-4CA4-8708-F5D2EEC168E0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phosphate mediated biomimetic synthesis of tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/12a99e9e43525209b857e7cb1e5708d3"><gtr:id>12a99e9e43525209b857e7cb1e5708d3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pesnot T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545de35302df83.29336102</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B74071FF-18F5-454F-90E6-37A1590A13D4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Catalytic Potential of
