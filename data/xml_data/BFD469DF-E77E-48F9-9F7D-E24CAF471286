&lt;p>This research project identifies examples of social and environmental enterprises in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East African Community (EAC), to explore and evaluate the role that these enterprises may play as a mechanism to 'trickle up' social, environmental and economic benefits from within local communities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A directory will be developed of examples of social or environmental enterprises that produce, retail, manufacture or offer services within the SADC and EAC countries, as well as the donor agencies, voluntary associations and assurance schemes that support these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Using a mixed methodology combining archival data analysis, surveys, and interviews the study will analyse the examples with the Directory, followed by in-depth qualitative case study research on 9-12 social and/or environmental enterprises from within Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study will consider the interaction of these enterprises with their local and global supply chains, explore the role of donor funding and industry associations, and evaluate the specific role that such enterprises may play in poverty alleviation and sustainable development within communities typically considered to be in the economic 'base of the pyramid'.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>279962</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Trickle Out Africa Project: Presentation by Dr David Littlewood - Institute for Small Business and Entrepreneurship (ISBE) Conference 2012, Dublin 7-8th November.

The main specific feature of the ICSEM Project is its geographic coverage: it aims to compare social enterprise models and their respective institutionalisation processes across the world. It thus relies on the participation of a large number of researchers from all regions, who contribute country-specific or field-specific analysis of social enterprise models. Of course, contributions comparing social enterprise models in two or more countries are welcome as well. The ICSEM Project was officially launched on July 5, 2013 just after the 4th EMES International Research Conference held at the University of Liege, Belgium. The Project now involves over 200 researchers from some 50 countries. The ICSEM Project is jointly coordinated by Jacques Defourny (CES - University of Liege) and Marthe Nyssens (CIRTES - Catholic University of Louvain).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The research undertaken during the TOA project is being used to inform our contribution to this international network of researchers, in particular to provide input on social enterprise models in Africa</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cape Town</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>University Cape Town/British Council Researcher Links Programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>32CAD311-D9E8-4B02-934B-FDD4A2DAD18E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>a grant of &amp;pound;47000 to run the workshop and pay costs for 34 early career researchers, 4 mentors to attend as well as the costs of delivering the event</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54493319c5b8d3.63341179-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>My partner at UCT, Dr Eliada Griffin-El is a full partner in the design and delivery of the funded workshop.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>As a result of the activities during the grant I have partnered with a senior staff member from UCT in the Graduate School of Business to bid for a British Council Researcher Links workshop grant.

Details:
Researchers at Queen's University Belfast make an enormous impact on the world in which we live. From groundbreaking work into new designs for aircraft, playing a world leading role in cybersecurity and helping the chemical industry find cleaner, green solutions to pollution, to discovering new ways of harnessing wave energy and innovative methods of bringing music to audiences. This pilot series of engaging talks gave us the chance to hear researchers talk passionately about their work and the benefits it brings. At each event, three researchers explained their latest research project for 20 minutes each, before responding to questions and comments from the audience. These events were well received by all those in attendance.

It has advanced the knowledge and understanding of the field of social purpose ventures in Africa, informal economy dynamics, and base of the pyramid business ventures. 

The main scientific impacts from our research where we contribute to empirical understanding, methods, theory and application are detailed across our outputs, of which there are over 50 in the research catalogue. In summary these are:
? Institutional Theory - Greater awareness and understanding of the influence of context and institutional forces on the nature of social purpose ventures raging from for-profits with an environmental mission, to social enterprise and non-profit models.
? Hybrid Organisations - Examination of the nature of hybrid organisations in sub-Saharan Africa.
? Impact Mapping - Development and testing of a framework for mapping the impact of these organisations across their social, economic and environmental dimensions.
? The formal/informal economy - Conceptualisation of the nexus between the informal and formal economies within developing countries and the implication of this for targeting entrepreneurial initiatives and research. Presentation of a model of segmentation of a continuum of informal to formal business ventures. In addition we also explore the nature of supply chain models that are emerging in this interface where the informal economy is considered as a legitimate route to market.
? Social Exclusion - Understanding of the role of social purpose ventures in addressing social exclusion issues in the developing world.
? How the poor manage their money - Conceptualisation of the role of alternative financial services utilised in the informal economy, their role as facilitating process to alleviate poverty and the business models emerging from within the formal economy that mimic these village based informal ways of managing money.

In this section we consider the findings and outputs related to scientific impact (detailed in the research catalogue, at www.trickleout.net, and on our YouTube channel).

Our findings are emerging from the significant data sources we have developed. These include:
? Twenty case studies of social purpose ventures (hybrid organizations) in Zambia, Kenya, South Africa and Mozambique.
? Over 400 interviews and focus groups with amongst stakeholders, case studies employees and managers during 24 weeks of overseas fieldwork collecting qualitative data on these organisations and informal economy markets;
? Quantitative data collected using an online survey in 5 languages linked to our enterprise directory with over 500 responses to date. 
? Interviews with 60 Kenyan and 60 South African informal economy micro-enterprises.

Our scientific outputs so far include contributions to three peer-reviewed book chapters and 14 conference papers. We have two more conference papers accepted for the Academy of Management August 2014 and the Subsistence Marketplaces Conference in Illinois in June 2014. 

In order to maximise early scientific impact the Trickle Out team have initially concentrated on publishing conference papers, working papers and case studies available in open access format on the website (12,321 downloads of documents), as well as publishing the book chapters in African or developing world specialist texts with leading groups of international authors. 

We are now concentrating on sharing our findings and theoretical contributions through leading international journal submissions. This includes an 'invited submission' and a 'revise and resubmit' decision for two of the top 45 journals used in the Financial Times research rankings (Impact factors 1.667 + 3.174). A third paper has been shortlisted from 100 submitted to a special edition of a leading international journal (3* ABS) and is currently under review. Additional submissions are also planned.

Please outline how these impacts were achieved (This can include specific academics/researchers through to broader academic groups. )

We adopted a diverse and multi-platform dissemination strategy to promote our scientific impacts including open access materials, presentation of early findings in conferences, a dedicated website hosting all our materials, a Facebook page, press releases, and production of YouTube videos of our events, fieldwork and presentations. We detail our dissemination activities related to economic/social impact later.

Our dissemination and engagement activities enhance our scientific impacts. Our evidence includes:
? 12,321 downloads of copies of the documents hosted on the site (working papers, presentations, case studies) over a 35 month period.
? 710 views of our conference presentations and lectures on YouTube.
? 14 conference papers presented (France, UK, USA, South Africa, Ireland, Canada).
? Four nominations for 'Best paper in Track' in 2012 and 2013.
? Award of best paper in the social, environmental and ethical enterprise track at the Institute for Small Business and Entrepreneurship Conference 2013 .

Our academic activities have also includes academic impact events such as:
? A Public Lecture at Queen's University (also available as a video online).
? Guest lectures at Universities of Salford (UK), Bondo University College (Kenya), University of Nairobi (Kenya), and University of Cape Town (S.Africa).
? A two day workshop for 22 African academics held in Nairobi.
? An evening Master Class with 70 invited members of Kenyan government, industry, media and civil society including a presentation by Prof Richard Harrison on 'Fostering Entrepreneurship - the role of enterprise in economic development'.

We are also actively collaborating with fellow academics in the UK, USA, Europe and South Africa (Universities of Amsterdam, Cape Town, Reading, Babson College), and are a founder member of the International Comparative Social Enterprise Models - ICSEM - Project launched July 2013 that includes over 200 researchers from 50 countries.
Our research has impacted upon a range of audiences from the academic community for instance: those that use our research materials (papers, data sets, case studies, enterprise directory) for their own academic enquiries; those accessing our knowledge transfer activities (events); those viewing our disseminations activities (conferences, public lectures, video clips); and those we are collaborating with (e.g. ICSEM).
The impact of our research was recognised by the nomination and selection as a finalist in the All-Party Awards in International Development as 'Outstanding Academic Study in Development'.

We have also had impact upon the 22 attendees from Malawi, Zambia, Kenya and Southern Africa in our capacity building and knowledge exchange workshop in Nairobi. &amp;quot;The workshop was really insightfulit was good to meet with other researchers and network&amp;quot; (participant from University of Lusaka, Zambia). &amp;quot;The Workshop was so valuable and an eye opener to social enterprise research&amp;quot; (participant from Moi University). One of these participants subsequently attended a meeting with the regulatory body for universities in Kenya, where they suggested that social entrepreneurship should be taught at MBA level (participant from University of Nairobi). Two of the participants (Zambia and South Africa) have linked up in a south-south network to submit a grant proposal. A Kenyan academic participant from Bondo University College also noted &amp;quot;the experience I gained was enormous as I was able to create linkages and network&amp;quot;.

Numerous students and academics have accessed our website resources including the papers as evidenced by the 12, 231 downloads. Working Paper 1, on defining social enterprises has 2186 downloads, the bibliography 855,and the case study series of detailed impact profiles have been downloaded 1115 times. These numbers excludes those that access this resources from the outputs listed on the ESRC website research catalogue. 

Here we look at our impacts on policy and practice outside academia. Making a specific link between our outputs with resultant impact can be problematic. Nevertheless we do have evidence that impacts have occurred from communications received from individuals and groups.

In particular our case study organisations have identified impacts from working with us. One organisation profiled highlighted how the project is helping to shape its future strategic direction. &amp;quot;It (the detailed case analysis) identifies our key strengths and obvious weaknesses. There is much for us to do in increasing our educational impact, some of which we will address with the workshops and teaching scheme listed. Your conclusions will be a very useful reference, especially when fine-tuning our business plan and for future funding applications&amp;quot;. Another case study was recently shortlisted for the prestigious Ashden Award for green trailblazers, with the CEO crediting our coverage as a contributory factor. 

The enterprise directory lists almost 4000 organisations. Though hard to identify impacts are undoubtedly occurring. &amp;quot;I came across your website while researching a new business venture. I am starting up a company aiming to raise awareness of global craftsmanship though the sale of goods, very much like those produced by some of the companies featured on your website. Yours is the most useful I have found so far and I certainly hope to be contacting some of the suppliers.&amp;quot; 

This research is also informing policy and practice amongst practitioner organisations, especially in partnership with the South African based NGO the African Social Entrepreneurs Network, using our data to inform their presentations to the World Social Enterprise Forum and their practice. They recently presented their assessment Southern African social entrepreneurs training needs and their practical response to this, informed by the data collected we shared with them.

We have a range of findings and outputs that support the generation of social and economic impact.

One of our main outputs is the website which hosts a free searchable online directory of social and environmental business and those that support them across the 19 countries of Southern and Eastern Africa. This directory is constantly growing with new organisations registering online to be entered.

We also have 20 case study profiles with detailed impact profiles being developed and published on the website. These detailed case studies can be used by the organisations to help them to understand their own impacts from a sustainable development and poverty alleviation perspective. These published cases are approved by the organisations we worked with before being posted online. In addition they offer a framework that can be used by other organisations to consider their own impacts and for policy makers to visualise the kinds of impacts that might occur.

Our findings and thoughts have also been discussed in over 20 newspaper articles, blog posts and interviews - including an article we published in the Big Issue online magazine. These practitioner focused discussions and outputs help to promote our impacts at a policy level and contribute to the emerging discussions on the role of social and environmental enterprises as development vehicles within developing countries.

Our outputs also include practitioner focused events, namely the launch of the project in Nairobi and the evening Master Class on Entrepreneurship attended by 70 members of Kenyan civil society and policy makers. Both were filmed so that a wider audience could view them. These events support the social impacts of the project introducing policy makers more widely to issues associated with the development through enterprise agenda. 

Please outline how these impacts were achieved (This can be at a broad societal level through to specific individuals or groups.)

Our strategy for generating economic, social and scientific impacts involved using a varied platform for engagement, promotion of our activities, dissemination of findings, and contributions to multiple potential audiences. 

We believe our website with 3.8 million page views last year generated significant impact, especially the free directory which can be searched by key word, business type or by one of the 19 countries. Whilst use of the non-English versions (Afrikaans, Portuguese, French, and Kiswahili) was not frequent we believe it was important to have these available to make clear our inclusive approach. Using support organisations also captured some 'second-hand' access to organisations that would not normally have an internet presence. By doing an in-depth search for examples for the directory across many types of medium we were able to collect information on organisations that would traditionally be excluded.

We actively promoted our project through public events, give aways (pencils with the project logo and website address), contributions to social media (our Facebook page, trade articles and others blogging about us), and press releases.

We tried to make sure our findings and outputs were accessible. Hence we produced small videos of some of our presentations and talks. We offered materials in an open access format that could be downloaded and we produced project briefings in the five languages which we gave out at events and in the field. Indeed 2680 of the document downloads were in one of the four non-English languages.

We also reach out to partners, namely ASEN in South Africa and the East African Social Enterprise Network based in Kenya. We funded the participation of 22 academics in the workshop in Nairobi, paying for transport and accommodation. We also covered the costs for the launch and Master Class events which included networking receptions.

Please outline who the findings and outputs had an impact upon 

We believe that our findings and outputs have reached a wide ranging audience outside of academia. Our engagements with our case study organisations have led to some impacts on them and their operations. Indeed even the process of discussing trickle out impacts during the data collection phase actually led some to reflect and consider these aspects in their future planning. &amp;quot;Much of what we talked about has helped me shape xxxx strategy for 2013 and beyond&amp;quot;.

Our case studies also offer insights to similar kinds of groups and organisations who seek to build sustainability and poverty alleviation impacts into their activities.

We believe there has been impact on those organisations we profile in the business directory. Many of these 4000 organisations have no web presence of their own and at the very least our research offers a free resource for them - helping their customers, stakeholders, policy makers and the public find where they are and what they do.

We have interacted with groups involved in promoting enterprise led solutions to development with some resultant impacts. ASEN and EASEN attended and contributed to the practitioner events and the academic workshop in Nairobi - sharing insights and exchanging knowledge. 

We have reached policy makers through our impact events and potentially through the 20+ newspaper articles and online articles about the Trickle Out work and findings.

The publicity we generated about social purpose ventures, albeit as one of a number of voices, is contributing to the general upsurge in interest in these types of organisations as solutions to 'wicked' problems such as poverty. The lack of details on various African countries makes our work even more pertinent to multiple audiences including policy makers, funders, NGOs, development agencies, academics, students and the general public especially in relation to business as a vehicle for development focused around smaller scale enterprise models rather than just multinationals.



Unexpected Impacts 
We were not expecting the scale of the success of the website. Originally we had proposed we would list about 250 organisations and now we actually have around 4000. The site gets a phenomenal amount of traffic (which we accept no doubt includes some web scanning activities harvesting data) but nevertheless it received 6 million hits from March 2013-Feb 2014 with 162 million kilobytes of data downloaded and 3.8 million page views according to data provided by our website host. The scale of the document downloads of more than 12 thousand was also unexpected. Tracking the specific impact of this is activity is very difficult but we certainly see how we have potentially had an impact amongst a wide range of potential users. 

The success of the online presence is, we believe, related to a number of factors. Our time and effort investment in designing the free, searchable directory and populating this was critical, making it useable and comprehensive. The large number of trusted web links embedded in the site means we get a significant number of hits. Having a standalone site was also critical as this gave us the capacity to manage the flexible structure we needed and update the various elements. Providing the website in five languages was also important, and we invested significantly in getting this translated. Overall the success of the website and the traffic we are getting is down we believe to our varied dissemination strategy and thinking clearly about impact before the project started as part of the 'pathways to impact'- building in from the start ways to maximise our exposure to multiple audiences. 

We believe there will be potential future impacts of the work initiated by this grant. Now this initial funding has finished the Trickle Out Africa Project has been re-envisaged as a long term plan of activities building on our findings from this grant. We have incorporated an advisory panel of international members to guide our future direction and recently applied for recognition as a 'British Academy Research Project'. 

We were also shortlisted for a new large grant- whilst we did not ultimately receive funding we were successful at being shortlisted and our final review scores were very strong. We intend to continue to apply for funding linked to the emerging findings from this work and currently have a large grant bid under considerations with a US sponsor. We have been approached to work with groups in Cuba and Cambodia, and have joined the ICSEM Project and this may have future potential impacts. We continue to update the directory and website and continue with our engagement and dissemination strategy for maximising impact. The significant volume of data we have provides many opportunities for future impact. We anticipate producing more outputs related to the on-going analysis of the data including papers and detailed case studies. We will continue to monitor and capture information on our impacts in the varying forms they may occur.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>57B2626B-36FA-44AF-8B1B-1FF56187A584</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5449364131dfb7.49804247</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research is summarised at the Trickle Out Africa Project website, which includes the major outputs from the project alongside open access materials detailing early findings. The project team included Dr Diane Holt (Principal Investigator and Grant Holder) and Dr David Littlewood (Research Fellow). The team collected data during more than 24 weeks of fieldwork in Zambia, Kenya, South Africa and Mozambique during 2011 and 2012. The grant ended in March 2013 with early findings emerging from the research including:



- A suggested segmentation of the distribution of types of enterprises in the nexus between the informal/formal economy which has major implications for the targeting of development initiatives, microfinance and general 'development through enterprise' initiatives



- Evidence of extreme forms of hybridisation and partnership between various actors emerging amongst the social and environmental enterprises reported in the 19 countries of Southern and Eastern Africa, with almost 4000 such organisations available on the freely searchable database



- Evidence from survey data detailing the nature, scope, focus, funding and management of these organisations that many do not meet the 'criteria' often used to describe western centric social enterprises



- Clear evidence of the direct and indirect, positive and negative impacts of these organisations in their communities with detailed impact maps produced for the case studies (with a number available already on the website).



Further findings will be reported as they emerge and posted on the website and the research outcomes system.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research is already being used in a non-academic context. The website is being used by potential investors, customers and other stakeholders to find out about the various organisations. Some of the case studies involved are using the research to shape their strategic and operational decisions. Some case studies are also able to show how their received daily referrals from the website, bringing their products and services to a global audience. Indeed one of the case studies was recently shortlisted for an international award and credits the link with Trickle Out as a major factor in drawing attention to their organisation.



Recently the PI Dr Diane Holt was nominated for a national award from the All Party Group for International Development, in the category of 'Outstanding Academic Project in Development'. Shortlisted as a finalist the project received an 'honourable mention', which arguably recognises the potential impact of the project on a wide range of stakeholders in the developing world. 
 The research is already being put to use by many stakeholders and those interested in social and environmental enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa. The project website and directory is demonstrating significant reach and use, with 4.3 million hits, almost 530,000 unique visitors, 1.9 million page views, and 7500+ document downloads during the year from May 2012 to April 2013. Some 71.4 million kbytes of information has been accessed from the site during this period. 



The information presented on the site, early findings and general knowledge transfer activities are being promoted through conference papers, book chapter, engagement events such as workshops in Kenya and South Africa, public lectures, guest lectures, conferences and in the media. There have been more than 20 newspaper articles, blog posts, and online articles published in the UK and in Africa on the findings and the research project.



The case study organisations are using the findings from the analysis of their impacts and strategies to support their strategic developments. One case study stated stated 'Your conclusions will be a very useful reference, especially when fine-tuning our business plan and for future funding applications&amp;quot; . The wider group of companies are also benefiting, with the directory supporting their access to potential customers and donors. Recently one such investor stated &amp;quot;I came across your website while researching a new business venture. .. Yours is the most useful I have found so far and I certainly hope to be contacting some of the suppliers&amp;quot;.



Policymakers are also using the research findings. The South African based NGO, the African Social Entrepreneurs Network (ASEN), is using the data to inform their practice. They recently presented their assessment of the training needs of Southern African social entrepreneurs and their practical response to this, informed by this data.



As part of the research the team undertook a range of knowledge exchange, transfer and capacity building activities for social and environmental entrepreneurship within the region. Feedback from the participants from the capacity-building training workshop for entrepreneurship researchers from Malawi, Zambia, Kenya and Southern Africa (April 2012) suggest significant impacts on knowledge and facilitating networking. One of the workshop participants subsequently attended a meeting with the regulatory body for universities in Kenya, where they suggested that social entrepreneurship should be taught at MBA level , whilst others are linking up in south-south networks.



The findings from the analysis of the data will have wide ranging implications on the areas of social entrepreneurship, environmental entrepreneurship, social franchising, 'development through enterprise' debates and understanding enterprise models in informal economy communities. The findings may shape development interventions, policy initiatives, outreach activates and entrepreneurship education. Little empirical work exists on these types of enterprises in this part of the world and it is expected that this research and the associated directory of almost 4000 examples, the detailed case studies and the emerging findings from the empirical analysis of the data will have wide ranging uses.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C627FE77-EB3B-4FBB-BDBB-F121480329DD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4798754383.62244b2f2eca4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.trickleout.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>63B6C535-F3F1-4BD1-BC3E-AA4DC82CAADF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social Entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Academy of Management Perspectives</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d1c671b18eddc88e729eca1c587b33d7"><gtr:id>d1c671b18eddc88e729eca1c587b33d7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rivera-Santos M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>558980029786e6.60935560</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E293C378-26DB-4483-9679-8450BD38CEF9</gtr:id><gtr:title>ICSEM Working Paper - Social Enterprise in South Africa.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ICSEM Symposium, La Roche-en-Ardenne October 8-10 2014</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9d826f6ff0c4dbf68fe0121484bb186e"><gtr:id>9d826f6ff0c4dbf68fe0121484bb186e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Littlewood D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54495619c82b79.85231656</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08393D37-EC28-4928-9041-8BE2D3C07869</gtr:id><gtr:title>WP: Development through enterprise : a pilot study of social and environmental enterprises in Namibia</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d9783b2bb3d76d3446d10d8dca685e11"><gtr:id>d9783b2bb3d76d3446d10d8dca685e11</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Littlewood D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_8185350206cafcdae8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4753F588-5665-4BCC-AC48-621A04DE9CB7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social Enterprise and the Sustainable Development Goals - Entrepreneurship Symposium</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/01cf5f2ea5f33110256563aeffa4600e"><gtr:id>01cf5f2ea5f33110256563aeffa4600e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holt D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5898d38445c6e5.31906807</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AAB8EC86-06F9-4356-B1D5-5D1753B9665B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Addressing Rural Social Exclusion through African Social Purpose Ventures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle> Institute for Small Business and Entrepreneurship Conference (ISBE) Nov 12-13th 2013 Cardiff, UK</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/996823a71f4cc1353349a3a7e52c655c"><gtr:id>996823a71f4cc1353349a3a7e52c655c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> David Littlewood (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_2301119793cb4b1bd6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E4573ADC-4868-4B27-B540-63063A7403FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Financial services for the poor within the formal/informal nexus in sub-Saharan Africa.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Academy of Management Conference, Philadelphia 1-5th Aug</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/01cf5f2ea5f33110256563aeffa4600e"><gtr:id>01cf5f2ea5f33110256563aeffa4600e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holt D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5449416c43f3f9.17208237</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DC192988-5F51-41AE-882C-CF79B0F27B94</gtr:id><gtr:title>Framing social protection through social innovation - exploring case studies from sub-Saharan African social purpose ventures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Developmental Paper.
