Ribbentrop is a much maligned figure in the historiography of the Second World War. He is depicted almost without exception in both scholarly and popular literature as a man devoid of ideas and initiative, a slavish servant of Hitler, an incompetent lightweight and a diplomatic nonentity. Even at the time, however, it was acknowledged that he enjoyed a position of unparalleled intimacy with Hitler whose closest confidant and advisor on foreign affairs he remained for the best part of the Third Reich era. Moreover, as was also recognised by contemporaries, Ribbentrop's position with Hitler offered him unrivalled opportunities to influence the latter's thinking and policy decisions, either by communicating or withholding significant information (on Britain's willingness to fight in 1939, for example) or through sustained discussion of any given issue. One of the crucial arguments advanced in this research is that Ribbentrop's influence over Hitler's decision-making in 1938-9 in particular was substantially greater than has previously been thought; indeed, that, in view of his own political agenda, Ribbentrop purposefully sought to misinform the Nazi leader in 1939 in order to engineer a conflict between Great Britain and Germany.\n\nThe fact that Hitler, in circumvention of the traditional diplomatic channels, initially used Ribbentrop for important unofficial missions abroad, including intimate negotiations with British and French leaders as early as 1933, and thereafter promoted him to increasingly responsible and influential positions, culminating in the post of Reich Foreign Minister, which he held for seven years, itself suggests that there is much more to the Ribbentrop phenomenon than meets the eye. It certainly suggests that a serious re-evaluation of this individual's contribution to the international relations in which he played such an integral part is long overdue. The book will trace Ribbentrop's gravitation towards National Socialism and furnish a detailed account of his numerous and diverse forays into the realm of international diplomacy. It will provide much-needed information on his non-official initiatives in international affairs, such as his sponsoring of ties between British, French and German war veterans and his promotion of reciprocal cultural organisations and exchanges; it will endeavour to explain the nature of the relationship between Ribbentrop and Hitler, and between Ribbentrop and the other Nazi leaders, in the context of the foreign policy decision-making process of the Third Reich; it will analyse in depth the development by Ribbentrop of an alternative political and by implication military strategy which was designed to cater for the failure of Hitler's original plans in the sphere of Anglo-German relations; it will place special emphasis on the role of German-Soviet-Japanese collaboration in Ribbentrop's political thinking; it will convincingly challenge the generally accepted view of its principal subject's contribution to National Socialist foreign policy making; it will lead to a substantial revision of opinion on the historical significance of Joachim von Ribbentrop as an international statesman. \n\nThe research for the monograph has also shed considerable light on other aspects of National Socialist diplomacy and, crucially, on Hitler's appreciation of the international situation and the shifting balance of world power during the period 1928-33. This and other new findings/interpretations will feature in the text. The project is based on years of painstaking investigations in international archive centres, notably in the United Kingdom, Germany and the USA. It will be a major contribution to knowledge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will have a very considerable impact in a number of areas. It will benefit different groups and individuals for different reasons and in a variety of ways. Various means of dissemination are envisaged in order to ensure that the findings are made accessible to as wide and diverse an audience as possible. This will be achieved through the employment of different delivery media including the monograph, articles, conference papers, seminar presentations, various public fora including public lectures and informal presentations, media appearances (I have already appeared on BBC Radio and BBC Television in connection with this research), exposure in the local and national press and in prominent history-related publications such as 'History Today'. \n\nIt is certain that the appearance of a major work on a significant political figure, not least one who was a contemporary and associate of both Hitler and Stalin, will arouse considerable interest in scholarly circles, amongst students of history and, by no means least of all, amongst that sizeable section of the general public which has more than a passing interest in historical issues. \n\nScholars working in the same or in related fields will benefit not only in terms of their enhanced understanding of Ribbentrop's significance for the international developments of the 1930s and 1940s, but also in terms of the presentation of new factual evidence, the substantial contribution made by the research to the current historiography and the new debates which it opens up about aspects of National Socialism, the making of foreign policy under Hitler's regime and the international activities of the Third Reich. Postgraduate and undergraduate students of history will benefit from the research more in terms of the general pointers it will provide about the broad political goals sought by Hitler, the revelations it provides about Ribbentrop's contribution to their realisation and his construction of an alternative diplomatic strategy based on sustained collaboration with the Soviet Union.\n\nMembers of the general public will benefit from the research which will enhance their general understanding of the National Socialist regime and its foreign political aspirations and activities in relation to both the long-term and immediate origins of the Second World War, and the course of that conflict. The research will also have an impact on teachers of history at all levels who will be able to incorporate various aspects of my findings into their teaching. It will also be useful to teachers as an authoritative analysis of the major initiatives in international affairs undertaken by National Socialist Germany. As Ribbentrop played a central role in virtually every development of real significance after 1933 (for example, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the Anti-Comintern Pact and the German-Soviet agreements) the research will present sustained analysis and comment on these important developments.\n\nThe conclusions presented by my research on both the course and impact of Ribbentrop's career and on broader aspects of Nazism and the international relations of the 1930s and 1940s will certainly arouse interest in both the local and national press, not least due to the vastly different picture of Hitler's 'star diplomat' which it will present. My portrayal of Ribbentrop as a fairly shrewd and machiavellian practitioner of Realpolitik is very likely to attract press interest. At the very least I expect there to be detailed press reviews of my work. Indeed, such is the general interest in Nazism and the Second World War that I confidently anticipate being asked to write a piece for publication in a major newspaper. It is also likely that the research will arouse interest in contemporary diplomatic and political circles if only in view of its central subject matter.
