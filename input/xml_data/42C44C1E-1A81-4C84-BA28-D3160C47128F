We are one of just a few mammals (whales, elephants, seals, and bats, but no other primates) that learn their vocalizations. In contrast, vocal learning is common in birds, with thousands of species requiring social input for learning. Bird songs have become an exceptionally important model system for addressing all aspects of biology, ranging from gene expression and neural function to ecological and evolutionary questions. Just like humans produce different words and languages, many bird species also have diverse vocalizations for communicating a wide variety of information about their environments. However, to date only one of these signals (the sexual signals, or 'songs') has been studied in relation to vocal learning. The proposed work will be the first to examine vocal learning in other types of bird vocalizations ('calls'). I will examine vocal learning of two of the most important types of vocalizations that birds use to communicate about their environments: mobbing calls, and social group calls. The proposed study will focus on two groups of birds, each of which possesses highly developed social and ecological systems: tits (Family Paridae) and parrots (Family Psittacidae). 

Tits are some of our most beloved back-yard birds in the UK and although many of their behaviours are well studied, we know surprisingly little about their mobbing alarm calls. These calls advertise predators and recruit other flock members to harass, or 'mob' them. First, I will examine the mobbing calls of each species of British tit (great, blue, coal, marsh, willow, and crested tits) with field experiments to look at phylogenetic patterns in mobbing calls and whether they use a similar signalling system to North American chickadees. Chickadees have one of the most sophisticated alarm call systems of any animal, with different calls indicating the type of predator and subtle variations within a call indicating the specific level of threat. Do British tits use a similar vocal system to communicate about predators in their environment? Next, I will examine how birds learn to produce their mobbing alarm calls using a series of laboratory experiments conducted at St Andrews. Last, I will study how birds learn to use the alarm calls of other species to gain information about predators through a series of social learning experiments. The ability of animals to eavesdrop on the vocal signals of other species is one of the most exciting areas of research in bioacoustics and this will be the first study to experimentally examine how they learn this behaviour.

Like tits, parrots have complex social systems. Because they often live in fission-fusion societies with ever changing flock composition, they use social calls to communicate with flock members. Recent observations suggest that spectacled parrotlets may go one step further: they use specific vocalizations when engaging with certain individuals. Are these directed calls akin to human names? I will conduct experiments with a colony of spectacled parrotlets at St Andrews and make careful behavioural observations with wild birds in Panama to test how birds use their social calls to communicate with other members of their flock. If these birds use a system similar to humans, it will be the first demonstration of 'names' in an avian species, and will provide the basis for truly comparative work (with humans and dolphins) examining the ecological conditions required for the evolution of 'names.'

This combination of work with tits and parrotlets will be some of the first research conducted on social and vocal learning of bird calls, will provide key advances in our understanding of how animals communicate about their environments with members of their own and other species, will lead to important research publications, and will enable me to establish my UK career and develop my reputation as a leading bioacoustics researcher.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary users for this project are other academics, but the research has considerable potential for impact outside of the university environment:

Conservation: Successfully avoiding potential predators is critical for the survival of animals. This work, examining alarm call function and learning, could have important implications for conservation work related to non-native predators, native predator reintroductions, and raising endangered species for reintroduction. Similarly, understanding the ability of birds to vocally and behaviourally adjust to new social groups, and the process through which they learn this behaviour will provide information about acoustic and learning barriers for intergroup movements and may give important insights useful for translocation or reintroduction studies of endangered species. Better understanding these processes may in turn affect natural policy decisions. 

Zoos: The proposed work examining communication systems and learning of captive animals may have important consequences for others working with captive animals. It is important to understand how animals communicate within social groups in order to provide the best type of care for their well-being. For example, the proposed work, examining how birds use their social calls to interact with new flock members, may provide new insights into the best way to move animals between zoos as part of captive breeding programmes. 

Sound Recording Archives: The calls of birds have been poorly represented in sound archives, especially compared with bird songs. For example, the Macaulay Library, the world's largest nature sound archive has about 175,000 recordings of bird vocalizations, but less than a dozen of alarm calls where the predator or threat was known. Socially directed calls are similarly under-represented. The recordings generated during this proposed research will be deposited in nature libraries, like the Macaulay or the nature division of the British Library and could provide important resources for those creating nature documentaries or with other audio needs.

General Public: One of the most important things we can do as scientists is to get people interested in the natural world around them. My work will enhance the nation's culture through generating new and exciting knowledge about some of the most common and widely distributed birds in the UK. Through my previous work with chickadee alarm calls I helped inspire creative output in a number of disciplines, including the recently premiered Chickadee Symphony, an entire symphony based on chickadee vocalizations and behaviour, on which I consulted considerably with composer Craig Thomas Naylor. I expect that the proposed research will have a similar cultural contribution to the quality of life in the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>341606</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>University open day (St Andrews)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F55A941-A660-4A08-8493-C1A617E35FBD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented robotic raptors and spoke with prospective undergraduates students and their parents about our research and studying at university in general.

Key findings so far indicate that British tits have a sophisticated method of encoding information about predators into their mobbing alarm calls. Interestingly, different species appear to encode information in different ways and also vary in the reliability of their signals. We have demonstrated that these patterns are not related to phylogeny, suggesting that ecological and social roles in social groups drive vocal complexity. Our results also indicate that, surprisingly, some species are more likely to eavesdrop on the signals of more reliable species than listening to calls from their own species. 

Other research conducting during this time period has shown that birds pay constant and careful attention to the songs of their partner and that song complexity may not accurately predict a bird's cognitive ability.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main users for these research outputs are other academics and there is a large community of researchers who will be interested in our results (e.g. one of my previous papers on a similar subject has been cited more then 300 times). We expect that our work will help inspire follow-up research that helps us better understand animal communication and the natural world more broadly. 

In addition, we expect that our findings will be of use to educators and the general public. Educators may be able to incorporate work from this grant, examining interesting and readily observable behaviours of local birds, into lesson plans for primary school students. The general public in Britain has an immense interest in the local birds, as evidenced by the RSPB having more than 1 million members, and we expect that many of these bird watchers will be really interested in the results from our research. For example, knowing how different species encode information about predators might allow a keen bird watcher with information about the type or location of predators--exciting species to see up close and personal.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>79FA6885-4887-422A-BE59-932B4DEB3385</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54535efeac6025.51389498</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>764A9C21-86E0-40CD-91D6-7398B66389C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hoo are you?
