It is a microscopic organism, which can only survive in an environment completely devoid of oxygen. This alone, highlights Blastocystis as unusual, because none of the organisms it is closely genetically related to are negatively affected by an oxygenated environment. 
The peculiarity of Blastocystis has been shown in several research reports where unusual structures within Blastocystis have been observed, which have been reported as &amp;quot;mitochondrion-related organelles&amp;quot; (MROs). MROs are similar in shape, but have been predicted to be in different protein composition than typical mitochondria. There are several types of irregular mitochondria among parasitic organisms, the most commonly known are hydrogenosomes (producing molecular hydrogen) and mitosomes (with unknown functions). The MROs in Blastocystis fits neither category completely, but instead displays features of both, as well as normal mitochondria.
The proposed research will endeavour to unravel the mystery surrounding this bizarre organism and its equally strange internal structures. Using modern biochemical and proteomic techniques, we will seek to identify proteins within Blastocystis that function into its peculiar mitochondria. The framework of this investigation is based on previous experiments, which, although successful in predicting many proteins and metabolic pathways, produced mainly hypothetical and inconclusive results. By scaling up the experiments, growing Blastocystis under different atmospheric conditions and the use of alternative complementation systems, we will determine the functions of such hypothetical proteins. 
Moreover, environmental conditions that will be investigated include observations of protein concentrations alternations and functions in relation to changes in the oxygen content of the organism's environment. As a parasite, this organism is routinely exposed to oxygen when transferred between hosts, so we will investigate how Blastocystis survives during this transition. Similarly we will investigate the effects of iron concentration in the environment in order to investigate how Blastocystis retrieves the iron it requires for forming different complexes important to the function of many of its proteins.
To add to the mystery that is Blastocystis, it has also been shown that out of the four methods that most organisms use to produce the energy molecule ATP, Blastocystis contains all four within its genome. In most cases an organism will only have one. To discover why and how Blastocystis has so many different methods of generating energy we will characterise all these pathways using a combination of cell biological and biochemical techniques. 
Understanding the unique bridging nature of the Blastocystis MROs between canonical mitochondria, hydrogenosomes and mitosomes will allow Blastocystis to be established as a model organism for the further investigation of mitochondria found in other organisms. In addition, the fundamental research and knowledge that this project will produce, will benefit both research in biotechnology, where this knowledge can be used for the production of biomaterials (for example anaerobic production of Vitamins) or in biomedicine for drug-development of anti-parasitic compounds.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Blastocystis is a human intestinal parasite, recently considered to be a stramenopile, with a controversial pathogenicity, mainly because of lack of knowledge around its life cycle and function of its organelles. Since Blastocystis is a strict anaerobe, it was thought that lacked of canonical mitochondria, and instead it had hydrogenosomes, anaerobic organelles related to mitochondria. In contrast to typical hydrogenosomes, Blastocystis organelles seems to maintain cristae, a transmembrane potential and DNA. Recent genomic and transcriptomic data generated from Blastocystis demonstrated the presence of 700 putative mitochondrial and hydrogenosomal proteins. Amongst these only a few so far have been shown to localise into the organelles. The organelles are predicted to have additional mitochondrial characteristics, including pathways for amino acid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism and an incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle. The Blastocystis mitochondrion-related organelle (MRO) has metabolic properties that are found in aerobic and anaerobic mitochondria but also in hydrogenosomes. To get a further insight on the biochemical &amp;quot;raison d'etre&amp;quot; of Blastocystis MRO, we will address fundamental questions concerning the function of these organelles: Which are the unique biochemical properties of Blastocystis MRO? How Blastocystis and its organelle have adapted under parasitic lifestyle? How the environmental stimuli affect the metabolism of Blastocystis? To tackle these questions we will localise and functional characterise components of several biosynthetic pathways of Blastocystis MRO. In addition, we will purify Blastocystis MRO for in vivo assays and proteomic analyses under diverse conditions. Our work will identify the importance of the mitochondrion-related organelle for the parasite and consequently developing Blastocystis as a model organism for studying these fundamental organelles of the eukaryotic cell in addition to significant (for life) metabolic pathways.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The findings of this proposed project will not only benefit researchers exploring the basic biology and evolution of mitochondria; they will also have a number of important applications. Using new knowledge on anaerobic biochemistry in bio-production, and novel information into the discovery of novel drug-targets against anaerobic or parasitic organisms are some examples of the many potential applications of the findings of this project. These potential applications will improve the orientation of a variety of manufactures in synthetic biology and pharmacy, as well as alter the life of immunocompromised individuals or patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 

Furthermore, under this project a postdoctoral researcher will have a unique training opportunity. The postdoctoral researcher will develop skills on biochemistry, NMR, proteomics and evolutionary biology and abilities to question the &amp;quot;status quo&amp;quot; on current perspectives on the existence and function of mitochondria, organelles that are essential for every living eukaryotic cell. 

Lastly, the findings of this project will benefit all researchers with interest to any subject of biology. This knowledge will be transferred using the combination of published results in open access peer-reviewed journals and presentations in national/international conferences covering topics ranging from cell biology to parasitology to even organellar biology and evolution. Any potential commercial applications arising from this research project will be examined with the assist and support from the Kent Innovation and Enterprise unit that is present in the University of Kent.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>383722</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Whose genes are these?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>627DFC88-B03C-4331-83B5-D91786302046</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event is entitled &amp;quot;Where did you get those GENES!&amp;quot; and is a two-day laboratory based practical exercise.
