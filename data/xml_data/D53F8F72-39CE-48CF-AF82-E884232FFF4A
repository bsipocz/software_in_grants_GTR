The system will enable the removal of material in a controlled manner at the nanometre scale. This will enable the manufacture of nanostructures for a wide range of uses, from quantum devices to microscopic mechanical test pieces. The PFIB is equipped with scanning electron microscopy so that as material is removed in a controlled manner so a three dimensional image of the eroded area can be built up. This is tomography on the microscopic scale and enables one to image sub-surface features such as inclusions in a metal alloy, interpenetration of layers in a microelectronics device or corrosion around a second phase particle in a metal. Nanomachining is the other activity that a PFIB will perform well with samples of well defined geometry and/or thickness being produced with lengths varying from tens of nanometres (thickness of an electron transparent specimen) through to just under a millimetere. Once manufactured such specimens can be examined by transmission electron microscopy or a surface analysis technique such as secondary ion mass spectrometry. Thus this equipment bid will provide a new capability with far reaching impact across several themes and many sub-themes of the EPSRC portfolio significantly enhancing existing research both in Surrey and in collaborators across the UK as well as opening up new research possibilities. There are few single instruments currently available that can be applied to so many areas of scientific and engineering research. Materials research, one of the eight great technologies and a current government priority, is by far the most obvious benefactor but the manufacturing capability of the instrument will be applied to other nationally important areas such as experimental physics and metrology. This instrument will be very significant, its versatility and high efficiency has the potential to accelerate impact across many of these themes maintaining the United Kingdom's role as a leading science nation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The 'Integrated Plasma Source Focused Ion Beam with Scanning Electron Microscope' (hereafter PFIB) would be the second of its kind in the UK. PFIB offers FIB fabrication and specimen production at up to 100 times that of conventional FIB. The impact of such capability is: 
(i) the fabrication of larger devices and specimens,
(ii) faster turnaround times,
(iii) unique correlative microscopy and analysis opportunities,
(iv) unique capability in accurate EBSD and tomographic reconstruction.

(i), (iii) and (iv) offer unique possibilities for scientific study that will impact on science related to industrial applications as diverse as: electronic devices, aerospace, defence, industrial standards and protective coatings. As well as these unique scientific opportunities the higher throughout, coupled with these novel possibilities, offers accelerated impact. Many of the scientific studies are much faster when conducted by PFIB than, for example, thin foil microscopy. The UK needs to ensure that capabilities exist which lessen the lead-time for the impact of the benefits of scientific research in industry. This is especially true in structural materials and advanced manufacturing where the UK must speed up the movement of new materials and technologies up the TRL scale to ensure global competitiveness. 

In terms of immediate beneficiaries these include research partners in the fields of: (a) advanced coatings and adhesive bonding technologies (JFW), e.g. Crown packaging, Huntsman and Johnson Matthey, (b) metrology of advanced and advanced nano-fabrication (DCC), e.g. NPL and Sandvik and (c) advanced metals manufacture (MJW), e.g. Lockheed Martin UK, Rolls-Royce plc and TISICS plc. There are other industrial partners which are part of wider networks, such as the EPSRC funded Centre for Doctoral Training in MiNMaT (Micro- and NanoMaterials and Technologies).

The case for support details a number of milestones and metrics to ensure that the PFIB has the widest possible impact. The key milestones and outputs are:

1. Engaging with Industry, initially through our existing network of some 60 partners who would potentially benefit from FIB. Targets - Year 1: 30 research programmes and 15 partners, Year 2: 60 research programmes and 30 partners, Year 3: 90 research programmes and 45 partners.
2. Production of Application Notes on key PFIB capabilities. Five are planned for the first three years.
3. Webinars, again on key capabilities, will be used to promote the instrument and some key benefits of PFIB.
4. By the end of three years it is envisaged that the instrument will have partially, or entirely, enabled the publication of 30 first-quartile publications.
5. A poster linked to the website Made2Measure, launched on 18th January 2016 will be sent to 1,000 schools to promote the societal importance of the physical sciences.

In order to optimise the impact of the equipment, the research data obtained and the scientific discovery enabled, the PI and two CIs will meet four times a year to review the milestones and outputs. They will report to an Advisory Board who will scrutinise the efficacy of the research programme, including its impact.

Two events are also planned to ensure that the instrument is utilised effectively by both Industry and other academic institutions. The first of these will be an Open Day, three months after the commissioning of the instrument. This will focus on the capabilities of the instrument and prospects for research.The second event is a one-day scientific meeting which will showcase the best of the science and impact arising from the use of the equipment in the first two years. The PI and two CIs have experience with organising and running scientific meetings through their work with different professional institutions: IOM3, IoP, RMS respectively.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>789138</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P001521/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
