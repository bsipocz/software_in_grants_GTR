&lt;p>The first is a doctoral study that involved a comparative ethnography of 9 to 10-year-olds in two social class-differentiated schools in Teesside, north-east England. This research used extended participant observation to collect data on language use in formal and informal settings, and highlighted the local interactional meanings of the vernacular children bring to school. During the PDF, research will continue on the interactional and ideological processes that emerge in the everyday encounter between home dialect and school discourse. Findings from this research will be used to challenge&amp;nbsp; deficit-oriented perspectives on working-class children?s language that are once again becoming prominent in media discourse and some educational policy documents.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The second project is an ESRC-funded study of classroom interaction in an East London Primary school. This project developed an approach to teacher learning from video-recorded lessons that was informed by work in sociolinguistics and linguistic ethnography. The PDF will facilitate the writing of a book that elaborates this approach for use in teacher professional development.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84938</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Writing for academics and practitioners: Communicating findings from a linguistic ethnographic study of classroom discourse</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>77B746AD-A931-4660-91D4-E1202DCA3249</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full day workshop delivered to academics at the Faculty of Education and Social Studies, VIA University College, Aarhus, Denmark, 23rd May 2012.

The workshop addressed some of the tensions and issues that arise in the move from an interesting piece of data to publication of research findings in a linguistic ethnographic study of classroom discourse and interaction. It also asked participants to consider how video data might be used in teacher professional development and the extent to which linguistic ethnographic analyses can be made useful to educational practitioners.

I was invited to be Visiting Professor at VIA University College and to visit twice a year to run research workshops. Several participants are now engaging in educational research using the methods I talked about, which are based on a book I co-authored with Adam Lefstein during the period of the ESRC fellowship, Better than Best practice: Developing Teaching and Learning through Dialogue. Some of the participants are now involved in working with a Danish publisher to have the book translated into Danish so that teachers and other educational practitioners in Denmark can use it. There are further plans for a conference at VIA University College on the use of video in professional practice, for which I will be invited keynote speakers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3954326057.7640742a95300c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media interest - Article on research published in The Independent newspaper.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BA1AB1C-B285-40E6-B111-C2C832FCD71A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I published an article in The Independent newspaper on 10th February 2013: 'Saying no to &amp;quot;gizit&amp;quot; is plain prejudice: Why a war on dialect will quash curiosity and ideas' (www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/saying-no-to-gizit-is-plain-prejudice-8488358.html).

The ideas in this piece originated in a research article I wrote during the fellowship (for the journal Language and Education). The news article was written in response to a story about a head teacher in Teesside who had banned the use of local dialect speech at school and written to her pupils' parents to ask that they do they same at home. My response warns that the methods employed are both counterproductive and potentially very damaging. The article provoked productive debate, especially across social media (e.g. it was recommended on facebook 823 times and shared on twitter 72 times)


The article provoked productive public debate, especially across social media (e.g. it was recommended on facebook 823 times and shared on twitter 72 times). I also received several supportive emails from members of the public. I have since been asked to speak at several events in which both academics and educational practitioners are present.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54648884ef4cf2.92647406</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/saying-no-to-gizit-is-plain-prejudice-8488358.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop for A Level students</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>44163A03-6926-4D03-A296-8899AFFEC4FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I used data and findings from my research on language variation to run an interactive workshop ('English Language: Language Meaning, Language Change') for with A2 level students taking part in a 5-day residential course in language and linguistics held at Villers Park Educational Trust..

One of the participants, Line Moller-Daugaard, invited me to repeat the workshop for the benefit of her colleagues at VIA University College, Aarhus, Denmark. This has led to a long-standing relationship in which I visit VIA twice a year to run research training workshops for colleagues in The Faculty of Education and Social Studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7249486956.0464162abb134e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Better than Best Practice used as training materials for teachers taking part in project on dialogic pedagogy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E5627EE-1B7C-469D-B410-293F9397421C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54647ba8898c78.17915981</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.york.ac.uk/iee/research/dialogic_teaching.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>231D131E-92C3-413F-95D2-B9C66747B97C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Handbook of Pragmatics</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/373ef4e31a52837f0b627345eacd5b30"><gtr:id>373ef4e31a52837f0b627345eacd5b30</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snell, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>54647aed27afe7.97267593</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F893BB48-6B2F-43A7-A5C1-2A55AB43860A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Better Than Best Practice: Developing Teaching and Learning Through Dialogue</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/373ef4e31a52837f0b627345eacd5b30"><gtr:id>373ef4e31a52837f0b627345eacd5b30</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snell, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-61844-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_41273712943b9892da</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9BCFE195-8946-4C43-9642-2E88040D281B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Language and class revisited: The issue of vernacular maintenance</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/373ef4e31a52837f0b627345eacd5b30"><gtr:id>373ef4e31a52837f0b627345eacd5b30</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snell, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_4240588045cb0be3da</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1FBD9165-8416-4704-9207-FE1D6A9A1BA4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dialect, interaction and class positioning at school: from deficit to difference to repertoire</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Language and Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5686dde2cb3d2c6f92bae7a9e9b79f91"><gtr:id>5686dde2cb3d2c6f92bae7a9e9b79f91</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snell J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546478beb79895.25303606</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>902DAE2B-EDF6-438C-9402-E225DC118AFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Linguistic Ethnography</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5686dde2cb3d2c6f92bae7a9e9b79f91"><gtr:id>5686dde2cb3d2c6f92bae7a9e9b79f91</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snell J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464792e82bae9.84045734</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I036605/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>28710E94-8B47-404A-BD40-7BCB8C709774</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
