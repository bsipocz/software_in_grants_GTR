What I have done, is communicated my research findings to the police force that took part in my research. They said that they would use them to inform their leadership practice, although I have not received any further detailed information about what they have done with it.

Formal aspects of organisation such as power differences between employees and managers cause employees to be fearful of speaking up. On the other hand, voice can be legitimated where formal procedures encourage employees to speak up about particular types of information. Furthermore, the formal and informal channels through which employees speak to managers have different properties, some of which encourage interpersonal communication more than others. By viewing voice and silence in organisations through the lens of formality, it is possible to identify organisation-wide enablers and barriers to voice which are likely to influence voice behaviour. This research explored how perceived formality shaped voice and silence using a sample of 19 UK Police Officers. Card sort, semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used and formality was represented in three ways; in-role behaviours, relationship with manager; formal communication.
 
There were three key findings. 
 
1. Participants were more likely to share bad news, information about unethical behaviour and challenge a course of action with their manager where this was considered to be an in-role behaviour. This was because rewards or sanctions were likely to be incurred for speaking up or keeping quiet about these particular types of information. For example, sharing information about unethical behaviour was viewed as an in-role behaviour because police officers were expected to uphold the law and public safety at all times. Despite literature to suggest that individuals have a natural predisposition towards voice or silence, this research demonstrated that organisations can influence voice or silence by attaching rewards and sanctions which make the sharing of these types of information appear legitimate. 


2. Sharing information through formal communication channels was shaped by an assessment of the risk presented by the situation. The use of formal and informal communication channels was assessed according to the level of risk that the individual perceived for the given situation. Risk was identified by three factors; whether there was an organisational recording of the information; with whom the information was being shared; and the nature of the information being shared. The risk of speaking up was associated with sanctions including ostracism by team members, reduced opportunities for promotion, or damage to personal integrity. 


3. The relationship between employee and manager shaped the formal and informal channels used to communicate information. For example, a close relationship with a manager encouraged employees to speak up using informal channels, whereas a poor or distant relationship was more likely to encourage the use of formal channels. Formal communication represented a more risky situation.

 
This study extends the theory on organisational-level influences of voice and silence by highlighting that perceptions of formality are important for voice behaviour. Practical implications include the provision of formal communication channels and role expectations which encourage less senior members of the organisation to speak up.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research was done in the UK Police Service because they are an organisation whose origins are based on finding out information in order to restore justice and keep the public safe. Therefore, the flow of information from bottom to top, in particular from Police Constables who carry out the main customer-facing role, to more senior officers, is paramount. The research findings indicate that senior officers should focus on defining types of information which are of most use to them and formalising how they will be passed, when, to whom and via which method. Senior officers should also be aware of how they can facilitate a close working relationship with their lower level officers, providing them with the best opportunity to receive information. Finally, both formal and informal communication channels should be made available to all officers to encourage the most amount of voice possible, and that by understanding perceptions of risk associated with each channel, managers can implement solutions which reduce risk for employees. These findings are also suitable for non-policing audiences. I have done a number of public engagement activities for both academic and non-academic audiences, and there is usually great interest in my research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DBF199CC-7CD8-4A82-B61C-DD07242702ED</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e04972053673.63905060</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>45E5A53F-C358-40C3-B140-F339E35DFC9C</gtr:id><gtr:title>How does perceived formality shape unheard challenging voices?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The International Journal of Human Resource Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a1764899a76c3a5379dc9072b78f6a0d"><gtr:id>a1764899a76c3a5379dc9072b78f6a0d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brooks S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcb62ec9776.92343672</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K002562/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
