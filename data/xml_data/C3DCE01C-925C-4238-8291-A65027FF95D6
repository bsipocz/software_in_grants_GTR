The data may be high-dimensional due to the number of different variables being measured on a single patient (e.g. genetic or metabolomics studies) or the number of times a variable is repeatedly measured (e.g. longitudinal studies). In addition the number of individuals with available data in a study is now increasing (through the availability of Biobanks for example).
One way in which this data can be used is in screening or monitoring patients to determine their risk of developing a disease or requiring an intervention, or to classify patients into various risk groups.
Objective: In recent years joint models for multiple longitudinal (mainly continuous) and time-to-event data have been developed, which make use of mixed models. The popularity of these methods is evidenced by the success of software packages for joint models.
These methods provide personalised predictions of a patient's risk of experiencing an event. However, a key limitation of current models is the computational burden required to fit such models. This burden occurs if there is a high number of patients (many thousands instead of a few hundred), many repeated observations per patient, or multiple clinical biomarkers under consideration. These factors have limited the uptake of joint-modelling methodology to generally small sample sizes and only a few (2-4) longitudinal biomarkers.
In the machine learning literature variational approximation methods have been shown to give fast and accurate estimates of model parameters in a variety of settings. Recent statistical work has introduced these methods in univariate generalised linear mixed models, and in some genetic settings.
My proposal is to derive a mean-field variational Bayes (MFVB) approach to estimating joint models for multiple longitudinal biomarkers of different type (continuous, counts, binary, etc.) and time-to-event data. The basic idea of the approach is to avoid estimating the model parameters from the full likelihood function but instead, split the likelihood function into a product of more tractable functions, which can then be more easily estimated. The rationale is that by sacrificing a little in terms of model accuracy, we gain the ability to fit multivariate joint model within a reasonable period of time (seconds/minutes instead of hours/days). Making it practicable to fit such models in a reasonable time frame, will allow personalised risk-prediction and diagnostics to be performed in real-time and make a substantial contribution towards stratified medical treatment and intelligent medical systems.
Clinical Applications: The models developed will be used to assess the influence of covariates, and the correlation between at least 10 markers over time that have known links to a patient developing sight threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR). Considering that the ISDR dataset contains over 20,000 patients, even fitting a univariate mixed model to assess the evolution over time is computationally intensive with current methods. Fitting a model to assess the correlation over time between all of these markers would be infeasible. My approach will lead to an improved understanding of the complex relationship between various clinical markers and their changes over time. 
I will derive personalised risk prediction models for STDR, which will provide increased understanding of risk factors and will provide patient specific assessment of their risk of STDR within clinically relevant timeframes. Some markers that appear to have a significant association in univariate analysis may be found to be no longer significant when multiple markers are considered. The models will allow us to inform clinicians as to the most crucial markers influencing risk of developing a disease and also to determine the best time to plan the patient's next visit.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Methodology Development: The project will involve four distinct stages. In the first 9 months of the fellowship I will derive MFVB approximations for MGLMMs. Current MFVB methods for mixed models only consider a single longitudinal marker. I will derive the MFVB approximations for continuous, binary and count longitudinal variables when jointly modelled in a MGLMM. 
During months 9-21 of the fellowship I will derive MFVB approximations for joint models of multiple longitudinal markers of different types and time-to-event data. I propose using the MGLMM methodology developed in Stage 1 and combining it with a proportional hazards model (as is standard in joint modelling). I will derive the approximations to the hazard model in order to approximate the full likelihood. I will perform substantial assessment of the utility of the MFVB methods I develop. Specifically I will assess (i) the accuracy of the model parameter estimates compared to alternative joint model methodology (MCMC or frequentist approaches), (ii) the speed of model fitting (iii) the gain in fitting models to large datasets compared to using only a small subsample of the patients. The performance of the MFVB joint model will assessed using various real datasets including both large and smaller datasets and through rigorous simulation analysis. Months 22-30 of this fellowship would be used to derive dynamic predictions from the multivariate joint models derived in the previous Workstage. This will allow dynamic predictions of a patient's risk of experiencing an event that can be updated each time new information is available.
Software Development: The final 6 months of the fellowship will be used to develop user friendly code to fit the models developed during the first 3 stages. I will create functions in R to calculate MGLMMs and multivariate joint models as well as functions to assess predictive accuracy and graphically represent the predictions. These functions will be freely available R package.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>257981</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R024847/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
