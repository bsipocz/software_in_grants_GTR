everyday action</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M006433/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The politics of debt refers to complex and contested politics of debt that defines much of economic and cultural life in present-day Britain. This knowledge exchange project explores the role the Third Sector plays in shaping the wider politic conversations around access to affordable credit and problems associated with indebtedness. 

We know that in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis a growing number of civil society initiatives sought to engage individuals and communities as a way of shaping political debate. For some civil society groups the focus is on the wide range of people adversely affected by austerity measures; for others it is articulating the profound loss of trust in political and economic elites or using political action to experiment with ways individuals and communities could take back power over their own lives to reinvigorate the very practice of exercising political power. 

This project explores the resilience of civil society networks and their efforts to shape the wider debate about finance, debt and the UK economy. In particular, the interface between the digital and real-life spaces of the everyday political action. In other words, how these groups can be located in places like large-scale protests, offices, or church halls, which of course are not entirely bound by space; but increasingly use digital platforms to inform/foment the new forms of political engagement. This is accomplished through four interrelated work packages designed in collaboration with project partners: (1) mapping the network of digital and real-world actors and creating a network of networks 'Debt-CN'; (2) collaborative research on debt inequality; (3) Create and support a hashtag experiment documenting the roll-out of the Credit Union Service Organisation 'CURES' and alternative credit provider 'Fair for You'; (4) Collaborative research investigating digital transformations in small-scale lending.

Offering a flexible package of knowledge exchange activities is a relatively new approach to impact that is not simply about demonstrating how academic social research contributes to the national economy and drives improvements in government policy. We adopt an embedded approach to research that involves working closely with a network of individuals and organisations to deliver tangible contribution to organisational practice. Importantly we are experimenting with new digital forums that remain underexplored in social science research. For example, the #ReinventCU experiment replicates projects like #EnfieldExperiment between academics from the University of Manchester and London Borough council to develop local economic development strategy and the #BBCBudget that attempted to understand how BBC-users interact with digital content. 

Impact can be more local and more tangible than this. Where possible, we should aim to adopt a more 'embedded' approach to research which involves working more closely with the public, and public institutions, at a local level. The crucial common thread is the existence of a partnership between researchers and practitioners that generates a mutual exchange of knowledge which, in turn, improves the quality of the research and some aspect of service provision in tandem.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This knowledge exchange project creates a much-needed platform for engagement between academic and non-academic researchers to incubate new ideas and new ways of understanding the challenges to the UK economy. This research agenda has the potential to have wide-ranging political economic and policy implications that speak directly to social welfare and economic policy goals. 

Mapping and creating a network of individuals and organisations working and contributing to wider debates about finance and debt in contemporary Britain offers unique networking to a wide range of individuals in the public, non-profit and private sectors. These networking events will provide a platform for debate and discussion that will unpack the research process in ways that disrupt conventional representations of research as a linear. At the same time posing questions about the authorship and ownership of knowledge production that are often otherwise foreclosed in conventional research. This method attempts to develop a collaborative model of cross-sector and interdisciplinary research. 

Communications activity will translate research into an accessible and tailored format using a flexible package of digital outputs designed and co-produced with project partners. Digital content generation and dissemination is the cornerstone of this knowledge exchange project. This will include policy briefings, articles in network newsletters, journals and magazines, regular micro-blogs and content generation on social media platforms, interactive media and podcasts. The project team will make every effort to promote our social science research to the widest possible audience and make themselves available for press briefing/releases, press conferences/interviews, radio/TV appearance.

Research and dissemination will be based on formal in-kind collaboration with project partners to co-produce outputs. We combine a series of mechanisms such as consultancy, access to organisational materials and research archives, direct engagement with user community personnel to enhance the co-production of knowledge. Taken together this research project will contributing towards evidence based policy-making and influencing public policies and legislation at a local and national level.

The potential value of our programme of research seminars can be evidenced by the work of our project partners and the range of beneficiaries from the work conducted as part of this project:

- Civil society, advocacy groups, and trade unions: this series has the potential to influence organisational culture and practice within the various participating third sector groups, in particular those that develop their research and policy prescriptions into something that influences public debate, public policy or academic research. These groups will benefit from the collaborative platform that allows them to present and develop their policy positions and collaborate with academics in the co-production of a consultation report to the Financial Conduct Authority as well as digital content. 

- Policymakers and opinion formers: public sector beneficiaries include policy makers working on national economic planning that are sympathetic to Andy Haldane's call for a fundamental re-thinking of finance-led growth among the political and policy elites. 

- Think tanks that research and do advocacy as well as economic commentators/press, general public: one aim of the project is to explore and translate jargon around discussions of finance and debt.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>89567</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Greece on the Edge is a compelling short film that documents the everyday experiences of 'the Greek' financial crisis and years of severe austerity.

As a result the project team members were asked to be part of steering group with representation from all the key stakeholders and be part of funding bids for the initial development phase.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>564711bb14dd69.43532315</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://youtu.be/FlsTGCxuUCU</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Students in Debt</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0338105B-BC42-4B09-B509-C1EA7D3E060D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This afternoon event seeks to educate students about the fee-loan regime and discuss the effects of debt and indebtedness among students. Bringing in experts, we ask: what are income-contingent loans, who profits from your debt, how does the experience of having debt affect student wellbeing and life chances, and in what ways do fear of debt and the types of loans that are sold to students perpetuate inequalities? We also hear from activists on how debt can be resisted and how we can move from the idea of individual responsibility to collective action.The market created for Higher Education makes students the newest targets for NINJA loans (No Income, No Job, No Assets). Most students depend on credit to access higher education, also there are a host of other credit products - from overdrafts and credit cards to payday loans - specifically marketed to students because of their limited income. Looking to the US we know this is a 'ticking time bomb' as the young are shackled with mountains of high-cost credit that will take decades - during their prime earning years - to pay off. The UK is now seeing the emergence of its own Generation Debt - where the young must mortgage their future to gain access to today's economy. Current political rhetoric normalises these levels of debt as an 'investment' in the future or as simply necessary to cover the growing costs of education and to ensure that higher education is still available to all.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c232f4943c20.05305588</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.eventbrite.com/e/students-in-debt-tickets-19117307381?utm-medium=discovery&amp;utm-campaign=social&amp;utm-content=attendeeshare&amp;utm-source=cp&amp;utm-term=listing</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Financial Melancholia: Debt and Mental Health</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>709F698F-163A-4DF5-9962-D205A4246C6A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research briefing and stakeholder discussions between academics from a variety of disciplines (including politics, economics, psychology, sociology); debt advice organisations; mental health organisations; national and local government departments in order to develop new thinking and organisational practice to deal with mounting problems related to the mental health effects of debt.

By engaging directly with partners to co-shape the research agenda we have created user-led and collaborative work packages that engage directly with the prescient issues of indebtedness; in particular, how the 'politics of debt' shapes policy debates about the regulation of credit unions, local authority lending and debt advice. 

Working within the network of civil society groups seeking to shape and articulate the wider significance of debt in contemporary Britain was timely and important. This provided the right context to increased the uptake of ideas about the problem of household level debt. Specifically, the Labour Party invitation to contribute to the Shadow Chancellors New Economics Lecture Series, the Green Party taking up the proposal for Public Debt Audits, the Scottish Parliament interest in Credit Union report, and finally the project's research being used on Channel 4 Dispatches program. 

However, until the political climate among elite policy makers and senior politicians shifts from its current position to deny that household debt is a problem then the ultimate impact of this research will be blocked. The validity of the evidence gathered and the findings reported stand, they are the product of collaborations between academic and non-academic experts in retail financial services, credit unions, debt advice, peer advice, mental heath professionals as well as experts working as community organizers and political activists. However, until there is a political climate to accept these findings there is limited scope for direct political impact. Still the outputs from this project will continue to be useful in informing efforts to create new policies, industry best practice, and academic research methodologies - which are all relevant aspects of impact.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C6130D1A-696E-49E1-8E87-CE8440ED96A1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d955e06ad385.11398246</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This Knowledge Exchange Opportunity grant activity explored the many facets of the emerging politics of debt in Britain. It engaged directly with the everyday understandings of the causes and effects of household indebtedness. More constructively, it uncovered the ways in which civil society actors and individuals are taking it upon themselves to fill a significant policy gap; by becoming resilient and by exploring ways to restructure the economy in order to restore balance. There is much work to be done; collaboration and communication is necessary but sometimes lacking among the myriad actors, especially in terms of the digital spaces. The activites that took place under Knowledge Exchange combined resources, shared ideas, and co-created solutions to the problem of household indebtedness. While not nearly comprehensive enough, it offers a starting point: a space for collaborative conversation about debt and the ways in which we can work together to craft alternatives. Three interlocking themes summarize the key findings:

#DebtAction was a series of knowledge exchange activities that included civil society actors and academics sharing expertise and developing a common understanding of the causes and consequences of rising household debt levels. The concept of 'action' was in response to a perceived 'void' in public policy understanding and responses to indebtedness. There are a relatively small number Government sponsored research projects and policy reports that address the problems of debt in the UK; but, in reality no one government Department (Business Innovation and Skills), Regulator (Financial Conduct Authority) or the Bank of England is capable of single-handedly changing the trajectory of household indebtedness in the UK. Even if the Bank of England could to some degree, it won't for fear of sparking another financial crisis. Thus, a policy void is created as the scale and scope of household debt increases at the same time as policy-makers seek to understand ever-smaller populations of debtors in more detail. 

Financial Melancholia is a series of Knowledge Exchange activities that uncovered the important way that indebtedness links to wider public health issue of mental illness. The rise of mental health problems such as depression cannot be understood in narrowly medical terms, but instead needs to be understood in its political-economic context. An economy driven by debt (and prone to problem debt at the level of households) will have a predisposition towards rising rates of depression. These findings point to the much wider problem that widespread household indebtedness ties people to the past in ways which are not well understood. This is relevant because of the current policy context which seeks to promote positive psychology techniques to get people off benefits and into the labour market; we ask how living in a 'depressed' or 'unhappy' economy can be made visible when looking at everyday life. Contrary to popular belief, we find little evidence that indebted households are less responsible in their spending habits or management of their accumulated debts.

Hacking Local Debts was a series of Knowledge Exchange Opportunity events that facilitated intensive collaboration between civil society, the political engaged public and some academic expertise to collectively access Local Authority Public Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts and storing them in an Open Data format. This collaboration created a social process required to produce usable and effective data. Also it revealed the key obstacles to obtaining information on publically funded PFI contracts. Material from the workshop will be input to the Hackathon, and it is through this process the potential to use digital technologies to transform the identified issues will be realised. In simple terms it used a 'Follow the money' method explores the complex financial systems with multiple sources of and claims on revenue. Community-facing hackathons as collective data collection using FOI requests regarding PFI contracts. 'Hackathon' event that brings together experts in finance, for example: social enterprise entrepreneurs, public sector workers, academics, engaged citizens, in an intensive collaboration to produce a collective tool kit for access PFI contracts and storing them in an Open Data format.

Credit Union Alternatives Knowledge Exchange activities addressed the challenges faced by British credit unions as a result of the substantive growth in total assets, total capital and members - which have more than doubled since 2005. In the face of rapid expansion it is still not clear to what extent credit unions can cater for an increasingly polarised society in which the number of the working poor continuous to increase despite record level employment? The findings of these activities isolated the good and the problematic dimensions of growth and raised questions as to what the future will hold for credit unions. In particular, how will credit unions finance the growth in savings sustainably given the lack of income opportunities?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>#DebtAction shows quite clearly that household-level debt is a 'strategic policy silence' in contemporary Britain. In other words, most policy-makers, politicians, and economists know household debt is a problem but do nothing about it for (strategic) political reasons. What can be taken forward from this is an understanding of 'indebtedness' which denotes how debt changes the dynamics by which individuals, households and communities shape the economy. Households do not simply respond to economic stimulus, like low interest rates; they create the economy every day through their actions, reactions and inactions. This is relevant because it is far too easy to depict indebtedness as a 'personal' problem; this completely ignores that it is a widely shared problem across Britain and offers a clear warning sign of wider economic instability. The results of this Knowledge Exchange Opportunity can be taken forward by developing innovative new policy solutions to deal with rising household indebtedness that addressed is causal factors. Principally, tha by redressing decades of wage stagnation experienced by the majority of British households, as well as designing a better mass retail finance services system. More broadly, to design a more adaptive credit creation system that address the socio-economic realities of different income-level, education-level, age, asset holdings, and even geography all influence the types and levels of household debts.

Financial Melancholia Knowledge Exchange activities fostered a unique and often creative solutions by civil society groups and academics as they worked together to address the problems of indebtedness in the UK. More importantly, it served as an incubator for innovative solutions. Based on our research we use 'civil society' to denote a social space made of up dedicated individuals, key organisations, community-groups and new social enterprises. The term 'third-sector' could suffice but would suggest something much larger than the network of actors that currently work on issues of debt. Also, thinking of civil society as a social space of interaction provides a better framework for understanding the results of this research. These can be taken forward by policy makers as a call to looks beyond routine statistics to understand how individuals describe the experience of being deeply in debt and the related health and social problems that this involves. Take the our primary evidence from online peer-to-peer (P2P) forums that demonstrates qualitatively how people with chronic debt problems share their experiences and offer support to each other. Our analysis of those living with debt and depression suggests that, unless policymakers learn to empathise with those struggling with entrenched financial and psychological problems, attempts at 'behavioural activation' (via approaches like cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]) will fail. Depressed individuals already feel responsible for their own poverty and failure, but the government is only offering attempts to inculcate even greater personal responsibility.

Hacking Local Debts Knowledge Exchange activities mapped the size and economic significance of local authority PFI financing allows which can be used to re-imagine how local growth might take place in the future. We can see the potential impact of these Knowledge Exchange activities by way of example: citizen debt audits in Spain (PACD Municipal Debt Audit movement), debt audits in the global south, and the public debt 'truth commission' in Greece. Caroline Lucas (Green) MP is using this research to inform a potential cross-Party parliamentary commission to implement a UK debt audit. The results of this knowledge exchange shows that debt audits do not attack Local councils, but help them understand the scale of their losses in light of the largest budget cuts in a generation. From this we can take forward a method of democratic engagement that helps engaged citizens and local politicians to help them understand how the financial system functions and to ask important questions about what reforms are required to ensure public finance operates in the public interest.

Credit Union Alternatives Knowledge Exchange activities can be used to within the Credit Union sector to understand how consolidation, whilst required to serve customer needs and create financially sustainable credit unions, continues to reduce the number of credit unions active in the UK. This results in the sector being split into large credit unions that offer bank-like service and those, and substantially smaller ones that retain the initial savings and loan model locally. This mean Credit Unions need to link the restrictions imposed on the type of lending that is available to credit unions, because it is the type of customer that is problematic - cash-rich savers, in particular (soon-to-be) pensioners against younger customers with limited credit needs and/or on limited income. Credit Unions need to take forward their public profile to ensure media coverage does not adds to the confusion of the future of the sector. Since the Archbishop of Canterbury announced his ambitions to move credit unions at the forefront of fighting high-cost lending, the media has positioned credit unions alongside discussions of Wonga. Thus, not only is there a danger that credit unions are increasingly associated with low-income customers, but the move also pushes credit unions into engaging in lending activities they may be ill prepared for.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6AA0AFBF-1F4F-4E11-AAE3-46F964CAA5B3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c1e588239116.52326430</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.perc.org.uk/project_pages/debt-research-net/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advisory Board Member - Jubilee Debt Campaign</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9067A9AD-6FE2-457E-B7DD-644881E6B684</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As an academic advisory team member I am invited to general and issue-specific meeting to give expert advise on research and policy briefs targeted at supporters as well as national and international policy making bodies.
