This &amp;quot;cognitive social science&amp;quot; orientation demanded the use of multiple methods of fine-grained data collection and the use of innovative methods of data analysis, especially multidimensional scaling (MDS). 
This talk briefly specifies the underlying research questions and cognitive assumptions of mobility studies, then goes on to inspect how within POOC data-collection methods were tuned to obtaining specific forms of information and how the rapidly burgeoning field of MDS was &amp;quot;farmed&amp;quot; to select analysis methods matched to the nature of the data (and incidentally produce the [New]MDSX library of programs). Because subjects' verbalisations were also taken as constitutive of the data, ways of integrating qualitative and quantitative methods needed to be developed. 
By focussing on &amp;quot;how it was done&amp;quot; the talk aims to stir social researchers to be adventurous and innovative in their data collection and analysis, see how visualization can help presentation, and learn how MDS can help answer both methodological and substantive questions.

Moreover, survey designs often reflect the population structure. Thus, in a survey of voting, respondents (1) are clustered by constituencies (2). Multilevel models are currently being applied to a growing number of social science research areas, including educational and organisational research, epidemiology, voting behaviour, sociology, and geography. By using multilevel models we can model simultaneously at several levels, gaining the potential for improved estimation, valid inference and a better substantive understanding of the realities of the social world. This talk aims to show the potential of multilevel models making the argument without algebra but graphically and through examples.

During a period between 1865 and 1869 approximately 1 million people died of famine-related deaths and 1 million people emigrated. This had an immediate impact on an island where the population was just over 8 million but it has had a long-term impact on population within Ireland where today the population is still about 1.5 million lower than it was in 1841. Because of its importance and impact, much has been written about the effects of the Irish famine but the geographical impacts have been dealt with fairly crudely. In this presentation, I present a new, more detailed spatial view of the impacts of the famine and analyse why some places lost population at a much more devastating rate than others. The presentation provides a good example of the use of geographical information science to inform on spatial processes and to demonstrate how quantitative and qualitative investigations can be symbiotic.

Furthermore, those who withdraw from the police are denied access to one of the most basic services the state provides to its citizens. Procedural justice theory provides a robust understanding of why people cooperate. Experiences and perceptions of fair process are linked to legitimacy and, via legitimacy, to cooperation. We are motivated to cooperate with authorities we regard as legitimate; equally, we care about the fairness of the police because procedural justice communicates inclusion and status within the group it represents - the nation, state or 'community' - and we are also motivated to work on behalf of social groups to which we feel we belong. The procedural justice model is increasingly well-evidenced. However challenges arise in socially heterogeneous and cross-cultural settings. Does fairness mean the same thing to different groups of people? Are the links between procedural justice, legitimacy and cooperation consistent across diverse social settings? What role does shared group membership play in increasingly multi-cultural and multi-national societies? This paper explores these questions using date from two sources, the 5th round of the European Social Survey and a survey of young ethnic minority men living in London. Key aspects of the procedural justice model are found to be stable across different countries and different social groups, providing further support for the idea that fairness is central to the relationship between police and public.

Do people get on in life because they are bright and work hard (the meritocratic hypothesis), or because of their social class origins (the social origins and destinations-SAD-hypothesis)? Some researchers in the field think the UK is largely a meritocratic society, whereas others (often using the same datasets) think there is much social class inertia. In this talk, the emphasis is on lifecourse models of the factors that contribute to social mobility. The main factors addressed are parental social class, childhood intelligence, and education. I try to describe how each of these is associated with the other, and that all contribute to social position by mid-life. The data are drawn from a number of (mostly UK) cohort studies with longitudinal data. The UK is especially strong in having long-term data on people who have been followed up from childhood into adulthood, and in some cases to old age. In each case, structural equation modeling is applied by me and my collaborators to test path models of social position and social mobility. The results show that social mobility is dependent upon multiple factors, and that the meritocratic and SAD hypotheses both have some support, and some limitations.

This became the first regional category for Scotch whisky, now known as Speyside. Together with Highland, Lowland, Campbeltown and Islay, the regional categories for Scotch whisky all have protected GI status in EU law.

David Wishart debunks this conventional classification by region, and instead defines a typology based on flavour. With sensory analysis and profiling he applies cluster analysis to categorize single malt Scotch whiskies on 12 cardinal flavours, and constructs a flavour chart using principal component analysis. A flavour &amp;quot;spectrum&amp;quot; is obtained by serialization of the dissimilarity matrix, with the closest flavour matches for each brand identified by nearest neighbours. 

Following his lecture, David Wishart's flavour typology will be illustrated by a tasting of fine single malt Scotch whiskies that span his flavour spectrum.

They have offered new insights into causal processes; and have also revealed the variations in people's circumstances that occur year on year - and month on month - challenging notions of stable groups such as 'the poor' or the 'unemployed'. At the same time we have begun to have a better understanding of those factors associated with longer durations in a given state, whether poverty, lone parenthood, marriage, or job. It has been pointed out that cross-sectional analysis tends to focus on symptoms whereas longitudinal 

We know that there are strong associations between being of a particular ethnic group and certain outcomes, such as poverty, educational success, lone parenthood or pension entitlement. We also know from longitudinal research that different social groups face different risks of both ending up adverse or favourable circumstances. However, largely due to relatively small population sizes, till recently, it has been hard relatively hard to explore dynamic process comparatively across ethnic groups. Our knowledge of processes and durations that lead to the associations we observe in cross-sectional data are thus limited.

This lecture outlines the contribution of longitudinal approaches and explores a number of examples which have been able to shed light on comparisons between ethnic groups in dynamic processes. Looking at studies of welfare and poverty dynamics, social mobility, transitions into worklessness, and educational trajectories, it highlights the specific data sources that have been amenable to longitudinal analysis across ethnic groups in the past by providing large sample sizes, such as administrative data and the ONS Longitudinal Study, and moves on to consider longitudinal social surveys that incorporate ethnic minority oversamples, thus extending the possibilities for ethnic group comparisons within longitudinal analysis. The Millennium Cohort Study which will shortly be surveying children born in 2000 for the fifth time at age 11, enables increasing understanding of cross group dynamics and the different educational pathways that emerge across groups, while the new major panel survey, Understanding Society, will enhance our understanding of change, development and transitions across the age range. While facilitating substantial advances in longitudinal research across ethnic groups, limitations nevertheless remain. The lecture concludes with some caveats relating to sources, approaches and interpretation of differences.

This local Edinburgh seminar took place on Tuesday 7th May 2013 and was delivered by Professor Vernon Gayle, University of Edinburgh and Dr Paul Lambert, University of Stirling.

Abstract
There is a long history of studies that examine relationships between parental socio-economic positions and filial educational outcomes. The focus of this seminar is school attainment measured by General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations. GCSEs are public examinations and mark the first major educational branching point, and poor GCSE attainment is a considerable obstacle which often precludes young people from pursuing more advanced educational courses. Young people with low levels of GCSE attainment are frequently disadvantaged in the labour market, and are also likely to have a less favourable longer term experiences in the adult labour market. More recently it has been argued that detailed differences between occupations have important empirical effects on socio-economics outcomes. Microclasses are more fine-grained measures that are between 'big class categories' and individual occupations, and there is an emerging literature that suggests that they might provide useful insights.

In this work we operationalize a version of a UK 'microclass' scheme. We are not aware of any previous attempts to operationalize a scheme for UK data and therefore have constructed our own derivation algorithms for this purposes. In this seminar we consider a number of alternative classifications of parental occupations, which feature substantial variation in their level of detail. We conclude that the effects of parental occupations on school GCSE attainment are significant and stronger than the effects of both gender and ethnicity. The relationship is more marked when the data on parental occupations recognises specific and detailed differences between jobs. A notable example is the difference between school teachers and publicans, which in some UK socio-economic schemes are assigned to the same classification. We reflect upon the empirical and theoretical consequences for exploiting occupational data in studying educational attainment and in stratification research more generally.
