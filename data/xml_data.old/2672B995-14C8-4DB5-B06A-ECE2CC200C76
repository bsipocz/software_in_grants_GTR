Consequently, there is now growing interest in developing innovative and sustainable practices that can facilitate the social integration and desistance of former prisoners. Research on why and how people stop offending (desistance) has incrementally refocused attention on the kinds of conditions and supports that variously enable or constrain social integration and desistance. However, despite the identified correlations between participation in employment and desistance, this is an area that has received limited attention in policy, practice and research. Yet most serving and former prisoners want to work and see this as critical to their efforts to give up crime on release but they face particular challenges to accessing employment because of criminal records, employer attitudes and discrimination, which can pose a threat to their longer-term prospects for desistance. Responding to this gap in research, policy and practice, the intention of this study is to examine the potential of a recent innovation in the use of social cooperatives in the UK; that is the use of social co-operative structures of employment as a mechanism for supporting the resettlement of prisoners and enabling longer-term processes of desistance. In particular, this research uses case studies of more established through-the-prison-gate social cooperatives in Italy to inform emerging cooperative structures of employment in the criminal justice system in the UK in order to consider what social cooperatives might contribute to the integration and desistance of former prisoners; to consider how this learning can translate into improvements for policy design and service delivery in a criminal justice context; and crucially, to inform new ways of working to support social integration and desistance. 

The four phases of the research involve firstly, synthesising current research and policy literatures on co-production, desistance and social cooperatives prior to developing, in the second phase, a conceptual analytical framework through which to analyse the data generated in phases three to four. The third phase involves a qualitative analysis of two established Italian 'through-the-prison-gate' social cooperative structures of employment; the learning from phase three will be applied to two UK based social cooperatives over phase four, using multi-modal research methods, to examine over a period of 17 months the process through which the relevant stakeholders implemented these structures and examine the impacts, outputs and outcomes from the vantage point of the stakeholders and objectives of each social cooperative.

Essentially, the research design and associated activities will facilitate an ongoing exchange of knowledge, information and ideas between stakeholders and members of the cooperative, policy-makers and wider beneficiaries to stimulate increased consideration of the conditions in which social integration and desistance can be enabled and the kinds of innovative and sustainable practices through which this might be realised. The insights this research will engender will be widely shared with a range of stakeholders to maximise the reach of the project, but perhaps the greatest impact resides in the participatory nature of the research design oriented to the co-production of useful learning which will contribute to more positive and constructive lives for ex-offenders and their families and, thus the wellbeing of the communities in which they reside, and to the more effective use of scarce public resources.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will deliver direct benefits for the public, private and third sector organisations participating in the cooperative case studies in the form of improvements in their understanding of their role and contribution to former prisoners' social integration and desistance and of the experiences and effects of participation from the vantage point of all stakeholders. This will potentially provide impetus for improvements to the services they provide so as to enhance the employment and reintegration prospects of the former/prisoner members as well as methods of collaborative working. The beneficiaries of this learning further include a range of organisations across the various sectors currently (and potentially) involved with social cooperatives structures of employment with former/prisoners and those serving community sentences. The project will also be of significant interest to policy, practice and reform groups in criminal justice in the UK and internationally (some of whom are represented on the RAG and IAG) and to academics in related disciplines (see Academic Beneficiaries).

The current economic crisis has provided new impetus to policy debates about penal reform not least in terms of reducing the rapid prison growth and tackling the high rates of post-release offending evident in many penal jurisdictions. Developing the effectiveness of penal measures is seen as critical to such reform efforts in the UK through collaboration between diverse service providers. Understanding the impacts and outcomes of social cooperatives on former prisoners' prospects, and identifying the experiences of and outcomes for stakeholders engaged in multi-sectorial and inter-professional service collaborations will be of significant interest to penal policy makers and professionals. If social cooperatives can contribute to the social integration and desistance of former prisoners, this research may generate economic savings and reduce the human and social costs of crime and repeat imprisonment. Contributing to policy and practice improvements, however, needs to be coupled with successful implementation if improved outcomes are to be realised. This research is orientated to not only generating insights into outcomes but the conditions and processes that enable or constrain successful implementation.
 
The participating social cooperatives are very supportive of this research (see Letters of Support) and are keen to use the lessons emerging from the project to inform organisational and service developments. The participatory research design, project activities and outputs (see Case for Support) are designed to maximise the accessibility and utilisation of the findings. This research involves a wide range of stakeholders to influence both the quality of the outputs and the likelihood of securing buy-in from key beneficiaries. To ensure the findings reach a diverse audience outputs will be disseminated to a range of beneficiaries and will be well publicised using social media and made freely available online (see Pathways to Impact). The potential for impact will be enhanced by the Impact Advisory Group who can comment on the implications of the research in their different penal jurisdictions. Involvement in the research activities may encourage sustained dialogue and engagement across professions in different jurisdictions, providing impetus to developing a community of interest in this area. Using the research evidence as the basis for discussions and developing workshops and best practice guidance, the project encourages beneficiaries to assess and use research to inform policy and practice by using the findings to inform debate and exploring with participants the practical implications of the research. It is anticipated that this will lead to new approaches to practice, impacting on research and policy development, resettlement services and, critically, the lives of offenders and their families</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>140121</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>21st Council of Europe Conference of Directors of Prison and Probation Services</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D09190E-2CBC-4885-A1CD-8C787417E695</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Community Involvement, Coproduction and Community Justice</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beed6fbbd841.88154075</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NOMS Professional Practice Forum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>38C7E287-0B12-47AB-AE4A-B66E81809505</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Coproducing Desistance with Individuals, Groups and Communities</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beeae7034b96.10953100</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Annual Conference Probacni A Mediacni Sluzba</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6BB32BFF-3E61-421F-91B0-289AA1E7B408</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-producing Desistance: Towards a Sense of We-Ness</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beed3feaa353.51837054</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Roundtable Event with Mr Michael Gove and colleagues</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>40F55832-407C-4B51-BB27-9CD4D4EBF6A8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Input to round-table event to discuss and explore how social cooperatives in Europe can inform penal policy in the UK</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beebb269cc66.26176487</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Annual Conference International Community Corrections Association</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>969B4D3F-4917-4CB5-8CEC-984DCA650F26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Coproeducing Desistance: Towards a Sense of We-ness</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beebef66c2c8.01615044</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participatory Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D49B082B-65CF-4AC9-8FD4-D85A3841B3B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event took the form of a world cafe. The World Caf&amp;eacute; is essentially a participatory action research method for holding meaningful conversations around important questions in large group meetings. 
Participants (of which there were 22) included Apprentices (n=8), Directors (n=3), and Supervisors (n=3) from branches in Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle as well as Youth Offending Service professionals (n=5) and other professionals internal and external to the Skill Mill (n=3). This represented the first time that participants from these different areas had come together to share experiences and views. One outcome of this then was the development of a shared understanding of participants' perspectives with regard to the focus of the event.
The world cafe questions, comprising the focus of the event, were:-
1. What is this social enterprise all about? Operation, Purposes, Experiences 
2. How does participation in paid employment make a difference to people? What else matters?
3. Beyond participation in employment, how does participation in this social enterprise help people to a) give up crime b) feel more involved in their community? 
4. Who benefits from the work of the social enterprise and How? 
A further outcomes was the generation of research data for this study. 
Key findings include:
There appeared to be congruence between the aims of the participating social enterprise (SE), the means through which it seeks to realise those aims and the ends, or the outcomes. The SE provides young people aged 16-18 with 6 months employment in environmental maintenance work. Every employee is paid the minimum wage and is helped to progress into the wider labour market beyond their 6 month contract. The purpose of the SE is to equip young people with qualifications and meaningful work experience to capitalise on their motivations to participate, enhance skills (or capacities) and support entrance into apprenticeships and employment (opportunities), and in so doing, to provide a sense of purpose, routine and structure for young people who have been involved in offending and to contributed to improved outcomes for them. The parallels with desistance research are clear although understanding individual participant perspectives will be key to understanding how this works at the level of the individual from a range of perspectives. These individual perspectives will be collected through participation in interviews and participatory social mapping events throughout 2017. What this workshop also revealed was the wide range of beneficiaries and thus impacts of the work.

Among the impacts, outcomes and effects for young people of participation in both employment and the SE more broadly were the development of personal and social skills, the acquisition of new relationships, the creation of situational enablements to avoid offending; the development economic, human and social capital, as well as shifts in participants' personal and social identities - all of which, in general at least, enable young people to negotiate transitions to adulthood.

What emerged as significant to the outcomes was:
? The nature and quality of the work that young people participated in.
? The nature and quality of relationships particularly between young people and their supervisors but also between the SE and other professional groups and commercial or business enterprises which are fundamental to its operation, its success, its development and its sustainability.
? The voluntary nature of participation in the SE is a key dynamic contributing to the outcomes identified above.
? While the question as to how the SE might support social integration was perhaps too complex for this context, what emerged from the discussions was a perception of the SE as a community in its own right and in/of which young people felt apart. 
 
The workshop generated a lot of important insights that will inform the next stages of this research, not least in investigating some of these findings further and seeking elaboration on the ideas emerging. 

The next phase of the research involves interviews with Stakeholders and employees (young people). Semi-structured interviews informed by the outcomes of the workshops will be conducted to ascertain stakeholder and employee experiences of the development, operation and dynamics of the SE; identify incentives and disincentives for those participating; and ascertain their expectations and experiences of the SE in facilitating social integration and/or desistance and the anticipated challenges and tensions that might arise in the future. Further phases of the research include participatory group-based research and follow up interviews with professional stakeholders and employees.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2703f16fd82.27175113</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participatory Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8A71C745-B4D2-48A2-8070-3BB39B892372</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The World Caf&amp;eacute; is essentially a method for holding meaningful conversations around important questions in large group meetings. Participants included Apprentices/Employees (comprising adults involved in the criminal justice system), the Director of the Social enterprise (SE) and three Navigators.The world cafe questions were:-
1. What is this SE all about? Operation, Purposes, Experiences 
2. How does participation in paid employment make a difference to people? What else matters?
3. Beyond participation in employment, how does participation in this SE help people to a) give up crime b) feel more involved in their community? 
4. Who benefits from the work of this SE and How? 
This was the first time that the participants had come together to engage in discussion of these questions. Participants identified that it was useful to identify points of convergence and divergence in terms of the impacts and outcomes of participation in the SE. The idea was to generate discussion both as a means of engaging study participants but in terms of generating an overview of the view of participants - individually and collectively. This process has stimulated thinking in advance of subsequent phases of the research and assisted the development of a professional relationship with the researcher to support ongoing recruitment and retention of study participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2726217fb45.86137098</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in conference: panel</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1BEE295C-29C2-4C22-B7FA-1ECA3715ABC5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented my early findings from the project at the 2015 International Labour Organization's Co-operatives and the World of Work Research Conference in Antalya, Turkey (8-10 November).

This project will deliver direct benefits for the public, private and third sector organisations participating in the cooperative case studies in the form of improvements in their understanding of their role and contribution to former prisoners' social integration and desistance and of the experiences and effects of participation from the vantage point of all stakeholders. This will potentially provide impetus for improvements to the services they provide so as to enhance the employment and reintegration prospects of the former/prisoner members as well as methods of collaborative working. The beneficiaries of this learning further include a range of organisations across the various sectors currently (and potentially) involved with social cooperatives structures of employment with former/prisoners and those serving community sentences. The project will also be of significant interest to policy, practice and reform groups in criminal justice (in the UK and internationally). I plan to ensure that the potential users or beneficiaries are informed of my research findings by collaboration with both policy makers and relevant service providers, through publications, knowledge exchange events and social media. The potential impact of this research may include economic savings and a reduction in the human and social costs of crime and repeat imprisonment. If this impact is realised the potential benefits are will contribute to more effective services and safe communities.
An early publication by Weaver and Nicholson (2012) and this research by Weaver (Co-producing Desistance from Crime: The Role of Social Cooperative Structures of Employment) inspired and influenced Matt Fountain, founder of Freedom Bakery to establish the first social enterprise providing employment for prisoners in HMP Low Moss, Scotland, with plans to develop through-the-gate employment opportunities post-release (for evidence of this impact, see Testimonial by Matt Fountain, CEO, Freedom Bakery available on request).
