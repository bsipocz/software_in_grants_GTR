AMR can be directly tackled by reducing the spread of infection in the first instance. The primary school toilet is a risk-laden space for the spread of bacterial infection given the behaviour of its users. Research reports that fewer than half of the children who use school toilets wash their hands afterwards. Neutral poster-based messages such as 'Now Wash Your Hands' or classroom material may aid understanding and reinforce hand hygiene messages but what is the potential of using more novel, engaging, friendly and site-specific communication in the toilet environment itself?

Aims and objectives:
The primary aim of this communication design-led research is to investigate the potential of using ambient, surface-based communications in the primary school toilet environment to improve hand hygiene practices (lowering the toilet lid, hand washing and hand drying). Ambient communication involves the clever and unexpected integration of graphics and media messages in specific environments. It is usually employed by commercial companies to improve engagement with a product or brand but it holds much potential for application in other areas. If bacteria and other appropriate message/images were clever represented in the environment, for instance, what impact would it have on behaviour in that space?

This research involves three phases. Firstly a historical review of everyday representations of bacteria and hand hygiene aimed at children will be carried out. This will provide new knowledge of dominant ideas from the 20th Century about children, hygiene and bacteria and provide selected imaginative material to show to children in subsequent workshops. Secondly school children will be directly engaged with to gauge their understanding of the toilet space, what bacteria might look like there and where it is. Participatory design methods will be used to understand what children would design and why. Thirdly a set of ambient designs will be developed, informed by historical and contemporary design practice and children's imaginative ideas, for testing in school toilets and the toilets at Eureka! The National Children's Museum. The installation of the designs will facilitate the testing of the concept and provide opportunity for a pilot study of evaluation methods - what are the most effective and feasible ways to measure success of such an intervention?

Applications and Benefits.
This interdisciplinary, collaborative research project brings together academics and professionals from the areas of communication design, medical history, healthcare, education and microbiology. The project will involve a synthesis of approaches (historical analysis, participatory design methods, communication design practice, and science-led evaluation methods) and thus the application of the research is potentially wide. It can inform medical and public health historians about historical and contemporary ideologies underpinning bacteria representations aimed at children. It can also provide communication designers with an extensive set of designs and analysis to aid the designing of anti-bacterial products/interventions for children today. It will also bring microbiology research into a more public domain since we will use findings directly from microbiology research (related to toilet lid position) for one of the messages. The designs developed may also be applied not only within school toilets more widely but in children's hospitals or wards.

One of the key benefits of the research, if the intervention is successful, is potentially reducing the spread of infection due to school toilet usage. There are number of benefits to this aspect of the work alone: reducing absenteeism, reducing the occurrence of infections within the wider family, and reducing the request for antibiotics. The research will promote discussion amongst teachers and child-focused museums about current and potential future communications in the toilet space.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are a number of non academic beneficiaries of this research project:

PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN
The children that take part in the workshops will directly benefit from the discussions, play and activities of the participatory design workshops. There is evidence to support the notion of empowerment of participants during participatory design research and it is important for children to be feel involved in designing the messages they receive. By seeing the results in their own schools this sense of involvement will be nurtured and they will be able to see themselves 'making a difference'. The children who encounter the design inventions will directly benefit from the research in terms of receiving memorable messages which, if engaged with, may help reduce the spread of infection and school absenteeism. 

PARENTS
Since infections that children contract in schools can result in additional infections in up to 50% of household members there is a direct benefit to the health of parents if we can improve hand hygiene practices in schools. 

SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL STAFF
A new NICE report (NG63 'Antimicrobial stewardship: changing risk-related behaviours in the general population' in January 2017) presents several recommendations to schools about steps to take and resources to use. None of the recommended resources (including PHE's 'e-bug') provide resources for the toilet environment itself. We see this as an opportunity for our project. This project and its website will provide an accessible and research-led set of guidance about environment-specific communications to help teachers make an effective choice of materials to place there, including a set of resources developed by us that schools can help to test further. 

VISITORS TO EUREKA! THE NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MUSEUM
Eureka will directly benefit from the design outcome as it will extend the reach of their general ethos to otherwise very functional spaces. As stated in the letter of support &amp;quot;The Eureka! environment builds on the experiences that are familiar in children's everyday lives but also exposes them to a world of fantasy and imagination, encouraging them to extend their natural curiosity and sense of discovery to believe that anything is possible. This project aligns perfectly with our aim to do this and this project will allow us to extend this ethos to our functional facilities and not just our exhibition spaces&amp;quot;. Its visitors will also benefit from enhanced hand hygiene messages that may trigger greater engagement and provide 'take-home' messages.

PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANISATIONS
Organisations such as Public Health England (who produced and funded 'ebug.eu') will benefit from our results. Commissioners and designers of these systems will benefit from our research into how children respond to designs within the toilet space, enabling commissioners to understand and appreciate choice of graphic language and message placement. 

COMMERCIAL ORGANISATIONS
Commercial companies who produce materials for schools and children will benefit from the findings of our research with children, encouraging them to adopt certain evaluation methods for their own products and to learn and apply new insights to their own research and development. There is a need for robust testing of hand hygiene products for children in order to provide evidence of their potential impact. This is particularly important where schools are required to make considerable investment (say, in child-friendly hand dryers).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196731</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R002029/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
