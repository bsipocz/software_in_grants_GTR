The mobile app will be available to all, including feature mobile phone users, and as an on-line site to computer-users.

We envision this virtual community of women creative practitioners , theatre practitioners, researchers and other interested parties being able to 'discover' and engage with one another through this mobile app. Women creative practitioners who register will create on-line profiles with their contact details, the ability to upload playscripts, photos and links to video or youtube clips. All other users will specify their name, location and profession in order to participate in the forum discussions that are central function of this network, as well as accessing announcements and a live events listing. The forum is where we envision the collaborative analyse of issues and co-creation of knowledge regarding various concerns specific to the experiences of being contemporary African women will take place. This will involve moving away from static or macro approaches to our understanding of so-called 'African' identities that transcend the beleaguered discourses of 'gender and development' or 'empowerment'. Central to this project is the methodological approach that aims to place African-authored theories and practices related to gender, sexualities and identities at the centre of the study (see Bennett &amp;amp; Pereira, 2013). As such, the forum will facilitate discourse between female creative practitioners living in Africa regarding what issues related to the experiences of women in Africa need discussion, analysis and creative expression. In effect this will involve each participant both situating herself in her specific context, and then considering collective strategies for engaging in/ with these issues, as opposed to research questions being defined by what material or subjects are accessible, or pre-defined by the researcher. Conceptually then, the forums will aim to facilitate multiple levels of engagement, enabling users to interact with one another and compare methodologies, aesthetic choices and their impact on various communities in any way they choose, thereby broadening both content and the methodologies of our engagement with the emergent material.
It will also facilitate other publics, including potential audiences, critics, producers, directors, artistic/literary managers and programmers to access and engage with under-represented creative practitioners, and thereby broaden awareness of these largely unrepresented women and their work. 
E1M will create the two virtual spaces, train PI and Co-I to manage and curate the user-submitted content, and report on site use, including running a regular survey related to site efficacy. 
As creative practitioner, Amy Jephta will curate the sites, moderating content, co-facilitate the forum discussions, and liaise between the Women Playwrights International conference committee and organization, the University of Cape Town and the research project. She and the PI will co-edit a collection of previously unpublished plays by African female playwrights (Methuen) that emerge from this project.
As PI, Hutchison will co-facilitate the forum discussions, which will feed into her on-going research into how the aesthetics women creative practitioners in Africa are choosing to deploy in their work affect audience reception and engagement with the issues they raise. She will also participate in WPIC 2015, and co-edit African Theatre: Contemporary Women (James Currey) with African scholars Jane Plastow (University Leeds) and Christine Matzke (University Bayreuth, Germany) who will act as advisors to the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact will be the ways in which different users are enabled to share final performances, work-in-progress, and projects with one another; and the extent to which creative practitioners and researchers test ideas and share developing research on contemporary gender issues specific to the various African contexts with each other.

We hope to measure the impact of this project by considering 
 (a) The number of beneficiaries, such as creative practitioners, uploading work, theatre programmers registering for access, and researchers engaged in dialogues with creative practitioners and one another, as well as being able to see other interested parties who visit the site regularly. We would hope to have between 100-300 regular participants using this site by the end of the two-year project. 
(b) The number of plays/performance clips uploaded, and the geographic reach of the project. Ideally we would like to see a significant roll out from South Africa in 2015 to many more African countries. E1M currently provides platforms through Mxit to South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, with a growing base in Botswana, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Namibia, Uganda, Swaziland, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Egypt, Somalia; so we anticipate that this model will be transferable to other countries and contexts.
(c) The ways in which the site has had socio-economic impact for creative practitioners - insofar as they have been able to connect with one another and researchers more easily, been able to disseminate their work, and changed/adapted their work, alongside gaining more opportunities for work. 

We hope to gain this information through the mobi application's ability to report on how this site is impacting on communities. This will be achieved in two ways: 
1. by evaluating the degree of participation in the monthly forums facilitated through the mobi-forum space.

2. through the system regularly (3 points in the 2-year project: at 6, 12 and 18 months) asking members to comment, survey style on the following: 
- The extent to which they have been able to contextualise their own work, and later how the site has impacted on the content and visibility of their work locally, nationally and internationally.
- Whether/how this site has affected the choices they have made since becoming involved in the virtual community - for example, the themes with which they have been engaged, aesthetic choices, etc.
- What funding issues they face as creative practitioners , how they can lobby/access support.
- How they promote their work, how the site has affected this aspect of their work
- Whether the site has introduced them to the work of new creative practitioners or projects and/or functioned as a means of 'discovering' work. 
- To what extent they are already connected with other creative practitioners - how wide a range, how the site has affected this? Have any real world relationships (online or in person) been fostered after originating on the platform?
- Whether/ how they are/ have been engaged with researchers, and if so, in what areas of discussion. 
- Whether they find the research and/or questions engaged in by the academic sphere relevant or useful to their practice.

Another marker of impact will be how the network sustains itself beyond the two years of the project, possibly by adoption by a supporting institution, like WPIC or an academic centre in Africa. 

The potential long term impact is seeing more cross-continental and internal collaborations fostered between playmakers, more productions from African women on stage/produced, increased exposure to existing groups of theatre makers and raising the profile of African women in theatre, and the academic output published and available for reference after the end of the designated period.

Another potential impact is transposing this virtual network to other academic communties/ contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35954</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Yvette Hutchison, JC Niala and Time White (who met via awpn app) have collaborated on creating a conversational performance conceptualised to run about 30 minutes for the Tate Exchange's week of installations, conversations, and learning labs interrogating Who are we?

Weinvite audiences to engage with the three of us through sharing images, stories and gestural repertoires we hope to playfully deconstruct first assumptions we make about people, while considering the deeper paradoxes of cross-cultural living, and how we create, perform and negotiate personal and collective identity and a sense of belonging.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AD175280-E5DD-4D0F-896A-CCB4F665A74A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>tbc
Drawing on Judith Butler's argument that identity is formed via iteration over time and is maintained through repeated performances of socially constructed characteristics and appropriate gestures and signs (Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, New York: Routledge1990), we considered how these can be (re) negotiated through stories and personal interactions between people across cultures. The questions we want to ask participants at the end are: Who are you now? Who do you think we are? In what ways, if any, has this performance changed - your sense of self and the ways in which we can embrace newcomers?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b978f8ad3694.46667019</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Who do you think we are</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.whoareweproject.com/tuesday-art</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>International Centre for Women Playwrights</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>WPIC</gtr:description><gtr:id>98B4AC16-A7F2-4301-9683-CE1410597E3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The sharing of users between WPIC and AWPN.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d592f45d9503.64851341-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>WPIC gave us space during the conference to launch the app and explain the project.

Because it was hosted in Cape Town, it set aside special support so that 20% of the delegates could be from African countries. This made the event ideal to launch this application.

We used workshops and two performances as the basis for these discussions. We had noticed that although the registered users were happy to share new work on the site, they were more reluctant to post ideas, views or share too much on their personal profiles. Wwe wanted to analyse these reseravations with the participants and also see ghwo we could generate greater connectivity within the group. 

The performances included a new play by Sara Sawaari, 'Niqabi Ninja', to be published in the Methuen play collection as an outcome of the project. This play allowed us common ground to discuss form and responsibility when engaging gendered issues that relate to violence, and to often stereotypical approaches to topics like Islamic women. The second play by a rural youth group from a disadvantaged area of the W. Cape suggested how artists can work in rural areas, access and engage communities. It also allowed the 6 youths to share their personal and creative growth, and also engage them in our discussions around issues of gender and violence. The Director of the programme wrote that 'this weekend's symposium was a truly inspirational experience for all of us, particularly for the youth company members. These kinds of engagements tangibly contribute towards our growth as individuals and as an organisation.' 

In each workshop, we sought to highlighted a critical awareness of factors that impact on their development. These included a writing workshop - suggesting how artists can approach creativity in new ways, a playwright's panel, where we discussed the key challenges artists are facing and how they can strategize these - here funding and structures were identified as major factors, and the group began discussing ways of working differently within, but also challenging current arts administrative structures as well as space and audiences' assumptions regarding innovative work. Artists began understanding the need to seriously consider audiences when creating new work. A workshop on what is needed to create safe spaces for women to feel able to 'speak' in public for a - in which women realised how they often hesitate to collaborate because of minimal resources, but how collaboration is a key to strength. Also, how fear and assumptions regarding identity and issues regarding the legacies of the past continue to impact on collaboration in the present. We discussed 'safety' in relation to the artist herself, her processes and also in relation to engaging publics with disturbing material. The session 'Who can speak, about what?' raised issues of how to engage with the ethics of telling other peoples' stories, about form and affect. Through experimenting practically artists began to understand the impact of different strategies of telling other peoples' stories. Finally, we discuss how women can access festivals, and how these fora can affect the perception of women and their roles in society. Each workshop also provided a structured space in which the participants could began to strategize change and broker relationships. 

We reached out to a diverse range of women, from local communities in SA, nationally and internationally, of the 189 that registered, 55 found the resources to attend the event. Feedback from participants suggested that they had formed new awarenesses around 'how issues of social and political dynamics function', about how to have 'uneasy conversations' about 'access to state-sponsored institutions'. The youths suggested the event had given them pride in themselves and their work and encouraged them to continue working with other rural youths in this arts based practice. One respondent wrote: 'As a result of my participation at the symposium, I now view so many things in my profession differently, and I believe that the experience will make me a better theatre teacher and practitioner. On a very personal note, I learnt how to creatively go about writing a new script which borders on a very sensitive issue in my home country. This is what I consider as my highest achievement at the event. As a result of my participation at the symposium, I now view so many things in my profession differently, and I believe that the experience will make me a better theatre teacher and practitioner. On a very personal note, I learnt how to creatively go about writing a new script which borders on a very sensitive issue in my home country. This is what I consider as my highest achievement at the event. 
in a survey on the app following the conference, when asked: What is the one thing you have learnt from this symposium that you didn't know /were unaware of, going in? Some responses included: How to work on taboo topics, networking with other women in the arts. And above all I realised women artists go through same thing no matter the race, country or cultural background. How festivals in other countries are funded and supported. How the app works, could work. That safe spaces need to be constantly created. And that we can't rely on an experience to represent a vision. Sharing of Privileges. How to be a support system for others, and how to trust others for our safe space. I also learnt a lot about collaboration and most especially that to fail is not a crime. It's a stepping stone to knowledge. Also learnt that our worries as female Performing Artist and as a writer. About different spaces for artist that are available throughout Africa. I learned a lot about making theatre in South Africa and in a South African context, which I found really fascinating.

Immediate outcomes included a UCT fellowship for a Kenyan artist, a collaboration between a Ugandan playwright and SA director, professionals sharing skills with NGOs, and a skills database being added to AWPN profiles to foster further collaborations. Megan Furniss. Dancer Mamela Regional groups have been created under specific leadership of artists in the Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal and Gauteng areas to lobby for funds, festival programming, etc. 

Theatre Arts Admin has suggested hosting play-readings of the 7 plays developed with the project investigators and contracted by Methuen to be read at a festival 2018 or 2019.

In January 2016, 6 months into the project, we have 44 registered users between the ages of 22 and 69, from Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria, Botswana, Egypt, and Zimbabwe, as well as African artists in USA, UK and Europe on fellowships/ residencies have subscribed to the site. Additionally, there have been between 129 and 407 individual unique visitors per month, +15 text abstracts have been uploaded, and 23 events have been logged. By end of February 2017 we had 115 registered users between the ages of 17 and 69 from 16 countries, with a preponderance unsurprisingly from South Africa and the UK, areas from which the site was founded and conceived. There have been 6126 cumulative unique visitors to the site by February 2017. Both by posting ideas and running the symposium, we have been able to pose questions based on our gender research that has provoked discussion with and among artists via the network. This has impacted on ways in which they conceptualise work, collaborate and engage with structures in their countries that enable cultural production - like venues that programme work, funders and festival organisers. 

As one of the aims of the site is to make work available to wider publics, and programmers, work is being accessed in this way. I have had direct access requests from Manchester Exchange for artists, also from Equity in Theatre, and Playwrights Guild of Canada are using our site to access and screen potential Southern African playwrights for a 3-month residency. Zimbabwean Playwright Thembelihle Moyo has been approached by CASA network for an excerpt from her play, 'I want to fly', developed with us, for consideration for this residency. This is evidence that playwrights are becoming more visible through the site, and potential professional opportunities are emerging from these engagements. 

Through app we have been able to call for and read plays in development and work with artists to develop their work. This has resulted in playwrights from 7 countries being contracted by Methuen publishers for a new collection of 'Contemporary Plays by African Women' (Jan 2019) which the investigators of this project will edit. This is significant because there is a significant imbalance in work being published and/ or programmed in mainstream fora in Africa, with women being significantly under-represented. For example, in terms of published work Kathy Perkins's anthologies Black South African Women (Routledge, 1998) and African Women Playwrights (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, c2009) represent the most recent anthologies of plays focussed on women in theatre. Junkets, a South African in-house publishing company, is publishing a number of new male writers in single play-texts - of the five new plays published under its single volume New Voices series in 2013, no women were included.

Women are also able to share and communicate globally in relatively easy ways on a dedicated professional site, as opposed to a more general facebook site, where there is less focussed and screened traffic. Only authenticated participants can access material or engage in forum discussions. This guarantees some degree of safety for the participants on the site. This is important given the high frequency of trolling of women on online platforms.

2. Impact of symposium
The objective of this event was to structure developmental exchanges that allowed our analyses of trends (189 filled in the registration survey) on the network could be communicated to the 55 artists and other stakeholders from 8 countries present via workshops and two performances. We had noticed that although women were happy to share new work, they were reluctant to post ideas, views or share too much on their personal profiles. This suggested reservations, which we wanted to analyse further.
The performances included a new play by Sara Sawaari, which allowed us to discuss form and responsibility when engaging gendered issues that relate to violence, and to often stereotypical approaches to topics like Islamic women. The second play by a rural youth group from a disadvantaged area of the W. Cape suggested how artists can work in rural areas, access and engage communities. It also allowed the 6 youths to share their personal and creative growth, and also engage them in our discussions around issues of gender and violence. The Director of the programme wrote that 'this weekend's symposium was a truly inspirational experience for all of us, particularly for the youth company members. These kinds of engagements tangibly contribute towards our growth as individuals and as an organisation.' 

In each workshop, we sought to highlighted a critical awareness of factors that impact on their development. These included a writing workshop - suggesting how artists can approach creativity in new ways, a playwright's panel, where we discussed the key challenges artists are facing and how they can strategize these - here funding and structures were identified as major factors, and the group began discussing ways of working differently within, but also challenging current arts administrative structures as well as space and audiences' assumptions regarding innovative work. Artists began understanding the need to seriously consider audiences when creating new work. A workshop on what is needed to create safe spaces for women to feel able to 'speak' in public for a - in which women realised how they often hesitate to collaborate because of minimal resources, but how collaboration is a key to strength. Also, how fear and assumptions regarding identity and issues regarding the legacies of the past continue to impact on collaboration in the present. We discussed 'safety' in relation to the artist herself, her processes and also in relation to engaging publics with disturbing material. The session 'Who can speak, about what?' raised issues of how to engage with the ethics of telling other peoples' stories, about form and affect. Through experimenting practically artists began to understand the impact of different strategies of telling other peoples' stories. Finally, we discuss how women can access festivals, and how these fora can affect the perception of women and their roles in society. 

Each workshop provided a structured space in which the participants began to strategize change. We reached out to a diverse range of women, from local communities in SA, nationally and internationally. Feedback from participants suggested that they had formed new awarenesses around 'how issues of social and political dynamics function', about how to have 'uneasy conversations' about 'access to state-sponsored institutions'. 

Immediate outcomes included a UCT fellowship for a Kenyan artist, a collaboration between a Ugandan playwright and SA director, professionals sharing skills with NGOs, and a skills database being added to AWPN profiles to foster further collaborations. Megan Furniss. Dancer Mamela Regional groups have been created under specific leadership of artists in the Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal and Gauteng areas to lobby for funds, festival programming, etc. 
Theatre Arts Admin has suggested hosting play-readings of the 7 plays developed with the project investigators and contracted by Methuen to be read at a festival 2018 or 2019.

3. Impact from the app, beyond this project specifically

1. Tate exchange - Who do you think we are (14 March), http://www.whoareweproject.com/tuesday-art 
Yvette Hutchison met JC Niala via awpn. Together they submitted a proposal to Tate Exchange to create the performance, 'Who Do You think we are', and were accepted. They subsequently invited Dr Tim White (who tested the site originally) to collaborate with them on creating a conversational performance conceptualised to run about 30 minutes for the Tate Exchange's week of installations, conversations, and learning labs interrogating Who are we? (13-17 March). 

The performance installation aims to engage and disrupt audience member's internal assumptions about how we attribute identities to people without having met them. Weinvite audiences to engage with the three of us through sharing images, stories and gestural repertoires we hope to playfully deconstruct first assumptions we make about people, while considering the deeper paradoxes of cross-cultural living, and how we create, perform and negotiate personal and collective identity and a sense of belonging. Drawing on Judith Butler's argument that identity is formed via iteration over time and is maintained through repeated performances of socially constructed characteristics and appropriate gestures and signs (Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, New York: Routledge1990). We are considering how these can be (re) negotiated through stories and personal interactions between people across cultures. The questions we want to ask participants at the end are: Who are you now? Who do you think we are? In what ways, if any, has this performance changed - your sense of self and the ways in which we can embrace newcomers?

Notable impacts resulting from the development of this artistic or creative product - tbc.

2. YH was invited to be Advisor to the 'Debating feminist perspectives on commemoration, symbolic reparation, and the arts' AHRC Network, run by Jelke Boesten, International Development Institute, King's College, London (2017-19).
This Network Project aims to bring together academics, artists and curators who are interested in gendered aspects of conflict and post-conflict violence in commemorative art. A feminist perspective upon post conflict commemoration is urgently needed, as the field of a) memory and transitional justice is booming, both academically as well as in practice, and b) within this booming field, little attention is paid to how commemorative art may help unsettle harmful gender norms and contribute to transformative justice.
This project aims to explore what we know about gender and commemorative art in order to provide a feminist critique and sow the seeds for a critical community of scholars, artists and curators across boundaries that reflects on the gendered nature and effects of memory work in post conflict societies. 
YH was invited to advise on the South African aspect of this award because of her research on transitional justice and position as PI of the African Women Playwrights' network. She will give a paper at the two-day conference will host speakers from around the world who can reflect on feminist perspectives on commemoration, symbolic reparation, and the arts from a range of geographical and interdisciplinary perspectives; and advise on the installations and art to be featured at the event in Cape Town in December 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>39CAA161-0084-4B78-8B67-E331EBA6E084</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d59654c9bf12.77120948</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>By end of February 2017 we had 115 registered users between the ages of 17 and 69 from 16 countries, with a preponderance unsurprisingly from South Africa and the UK, areas from which the site was founded and conceived. There have been 6126 cumulative unique visitors to the site by February 2017. This suggests a significant gap between those visiting and viewing material on the site, and those registered with profiles, uploading material and events. This suggests that the app has been able to access a significant number of African women artists working in the performing arts, and others interested in engaging with them. 
There is also evidence that some of these women have been able to disseminate their work more widely and become more visible to theatre or festival programmers, educators, and others. We have had direct access requests from Manchester Exchange for artists, also from Equity in Theatre and Playwrights Guild of Canada, who are using our site to seek and screen applicants for a 3 month residency for a Southern African playwright. 
Their engagement with one another has been less successful - partly due to the app itself, which suggests the design of an online platform predetermines the ways in which people can/ not engage with one another, as research questions often determine research outcomes. We are addressing design to see how much this is affecting engagement, as opposed to the online form itself. 
We have been able to identify trends of the ways in which the participants are engaging with ideas and one another on the site: that they will post events or abstracts of work, but hesitate to post ideas or respond to debates in public. This has foregrounded issues of safe spaces and forms for women to speak. We then used a more traditional face to face forum, represented by women from 9 countries to highlight a critical awareness of factors that impact on African women artists' development. These included a writing workshop - suggesting how artists can approach creativity in new ways, a playwright's panel, where we discussed the key challenges artists are facing and how they can strategize these - here funding and structures were identified as major factors, and the group began discussing ways of working differently within, but also challenging current arts administrative structures as well as space and audiences' assumptions regarding innovative work. Artists began understanding the need to seriously consider audiences when creating new work. A workshop on what is needed to create safe spaces for women to feel able to 'speak' in public for a - in which women realised how they often hesitate to collaborate because of minimal resources, but how collaboration is a key to strength. Also, how fear and assumptions regarding identity, issues regarding the legacies of the past, perceived hierarchies of success and access to resources continue to impact on collaboration in the present. We discussed 'safety' in relation to the artist herself, her processes and also in relation to engaging publics with disturbing material. The session 'Who can speak, about what?' raised issues of how to engage with the ethics of telling other peoples' stories, about form and affect. Through watching specific examples of work and experimenting practically artists began to understand the ethics and potential impact of using various strategies to tell their own and other peoples' stories. Tis was particularly significant around telling socially or politically taboo stories. Finally, we discuss how women can access festivals, and how these fora can affect the perception of women and their roles in society. 
What has been evidenced in this research is that the app has revealed trends, but it required face to face encounters to engage and understand them and for the participants themselves to tease out the complexities and reasons for these trends. This suggests how an innovative online research tool can successfully be used to track behavioural data, but that more traditional research methods are needed to understand and create awareness and potentially change behaviours. 
Significantly for me, the app has provided me with a way of accessing material ethically, insofar as it simultaneously provides the participants ways to benefit themselves, and to control their own data, alongside my research project. My research input is not overt - but impacts through the questions I ask either directly or through facilitations via other artists, and is evidenced in the ways in which they respond to the questions in terms of conceptual awareness and behaviour as a community.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By engaging with the app, awpn.org</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>36FCE0B0-2135-43C7-B2F6-29FA0E8AD117</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d5967fa22cc4.97690262</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>In collaboration with a mobile technology company we have developed a mobile application that is accessible to feature-phone enabled with wifi, while also functioning on smart phones and computers - that enables female artists to create profiles, upload documents, photos, films, note events and links, as well as allowing for forum interactions and for surveys &amp;amp; questionnaires.

In January 2016, 6 months into the project, we have 44 registered users between the ages of 22 and 69, from Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria, Botswana, Egypt, and Zimbabwe, as well as African artists in USA, UK and Europe on fellowships/ residencies have subscribed to the site. Additionally, there have been between 129 and 407 individual unique visitors per month, +15 text abstracts have been uploaded, and 23 events have been logged. 
By end of February 2017 we had 115 registered users between the ages of 17 and 69 from 16 countries, with a preponderance unsurprisingly from South Africa and the UK, areas from which the site was founded and conceived. There have been 6126 cumulative unique visitors to the site by February 2017. This suggests a significant gap between those visiting and viewing material on the site, and those registered with profiles, uploading material and events. As one of the aims of the site is to make work available to wider publics, and programmers, work is being accessed in this way. I have had direct access requests from Manchester Exchange for artists, also from Equity in Theatre and Playwrights Guild of Canada. Zimbabwean Playwright Thembelihle Moyo has been approached by CASA network for permission to perform an excerpt from her play, 'I want to fly', developed with us.
We have also been able to identify trends of engagement by women - that they will post events or abstracts of work, but hesitate to post ideas or respond in public. This has foregrounded issues of safe spaces and forms for women to speak. How can this be facilitated online and in real space and time? Also, how much do women self-sensor and why? Following surveys and trends observe din the past 18 months we addressed some of these issues very successfully in a follow up symposium in real time. This suggests how a innovative research tool can successfully be used to track behavioural data, and then be used alongside more traditional modes to shift awareness and behaviour. 
Because of the app we have been able to call for and read plays in development and work with artists to develop their work and get it published. This has resulted in playwrights from 7 countries being contracted by Methuen publishers for a new collection of 'Contemporary Plays by African Women' (Jan 2019).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>569cadced073a3.45588068</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>mobile app</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://awpn.org</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>In collaboration with a mobile technology company we have developed a mobile application that is accessible to feature-phone enabled with wifi, while also functioning on smart phones and computers - that enables female artists to create profiles, upload documents, photos, films, note events and links, as well as allowing for forum interactions and for surveys &amp;amp; questionnaires.
