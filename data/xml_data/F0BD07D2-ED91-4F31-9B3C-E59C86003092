By 1887 the group was being referred to as the 'Newlyn School' and its work was attracting critical attention in London exhibitions. Paintings of fishermen and their families dominated this early phase of the school: the artists adopted some of the methods of contemporary French artists, posing their models out of doors and apparently aiming to present a truthful picture of the lives of the inhabitants of the village. More artists joined the original settlers, either temporarily or permanently. Newlyn thus became one of the many artists' colonies which flourished throughout Europe in the later decades of the nineteenth century. The term 'Newlyn School' has become well-established in art-historical discourse, and successive exhibitions at partner organisation Penlee House Gallery and Museum, which houses one of the best collections of the artists' work, have documented their lives and productions. \n\nHowever, while much useful research has been done recently at a local level, it is 25 years since the Newlyn artists' work was shown collectively in London (an exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery in 1985 being the last occasion). Since 1985, it has become apparent that the Newlyn artists were part of a larger group, including Charles Napier Hemy who lived in Falmouth, and an international group of artists who were based in St Ives, including Anders Zorn. In their interest in fisherfolk, the Newlyn artists were preceded by James Clarke Hook, who painted in St Ives, and by artists in other fishing villages around the British coast, such as Newhaven and Cullercoats. Recent academic studies of the painting of this period, and of artists' colonies in particular, have shown how the themes adopted in Newlyn had wider resonance in debates about class, gender, race and empire. This is a propitious time, therefore, for a study of the Newlyn artists and their contemporaries at Falmouth and St Ives which will synthesise the findings of local and academic research, and present the early paintings of fisherfolk in a proper context. \n\nThe student, supervised by Oxford Brookes University, will pay particular attention to the artists' relationship with the local community, which was strongly Methodist and pro-temperance, and to their approach to the practical details of the fishermen's lives and work, including fishing practices, costume, furniture and interiors. He/she will make use of two sources of information which have been under-researched to date: contemporary photographs and local newspapers. Several photographers had studios in Penzance in the late 19th century, and postcards of subjects similar to those treated by the artists became popular around this time. The Newlyn artists were accused by hostile critics of painting from photographs, but the precise relationship between the two art forms in this area has never been fully investigated. Local newspapers, such as the Cornish Telegraph, which was printed in Penzance, provide much information about the character of the local communities. In the same publication, references to London exhibitions indicate how the artists were regarded by the indigenous inhabitants of the area. \n\nThe research for this project will contribute to an updated, comprehensive account of the early years of the Newlyn School members and their relationship with other artists working in West Cornwall. This will be produced by Penlee House Gallery and Museum, either as the catalogue of an exhibition (possible venues are the Royal Academy and Tate Britain) or as a freestanding publication. The book/catalogue will be sold at Penlee House Gallery and Museum, and the research will be utilized in displays, t</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Newlyn paintings are popular with collectors, and the research on their fishing themes will, therefore, be of interest to dealers and auction houses, contributing to the identification of lost paintings and a fuller understanding of existing works.\n\nThis research will be of interest to a wide range of visitors to Penlee House Gallery and Museum, including:\n\na) local people, whose ancestors modelled for, and /or knew the artists concerned;\nb) local people, who would be interested in the changes to the practices and living conditions of fisherfolk over time and the contrast with the present day;\nc) visitors from elsewhere in the British Isles, who would see the artistic response to fisherfolk as part of their own history and be able to make comparisons with other industries and other parts of the country;\nd) visitors from overseas, who would be able to make comparisons with depictions of fishing in their own countries;\ne) visitors from overseas whose forebears came from Cornwall, who would gain an insight into the way their ancestors lived;\nf) children and families, for whom the fishing subjects offer rich educational potential, linked to the emphasis on the Victorian period in the national curriculum;\ng) special groups such as the elderly - many of the paintings show old fishermen and women, and interpretive material could specifically focus on this theme and on the attitudes and values revealed by the artists' treatment of it.\n\nThe research would also be useful for other museums which hold paintings by artists working in West Cornwall during this period, such as Tate Britain, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, and the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. Similar considerations would apply to the range of visitors catered for by these museums.\n\nThe wider audience reached by a definitive book on the Newlyn School and/or a London exhibition of the artists' work would include several of the categories of reader/visitors noted above. In addition, at a national level, the research would prompt reflection on the relationship between late nineteenth-century British painting and the better-known artists of French Realism and Impressionism. It would stimulate discussion of the strict gender differentiation which still affects the fishing industry today (Charles Kingsley's line, 'Men must work and women must weep' resonated strongly with the Newlyn painters, especially Walter Langley). The themes of loss at sea would also attract popular interest because of their relationship to the work of the RNLI. \n\nThe research will, therefore, make an economic impact on the nation's wealth by facilitating the income-generating activities of museums and galleries, which in turn will help to stimulate tourism and bring economic benefits to those urban centres (particularly Penzance) where the museums and galleries are located.\n\nThe project will also impact on the nation's culture and quality of life by providing information on the relationship between art and lived experience, which will enhance the experience of museum visitors. The displays, interpretive material and/or exhibitions based on the research will contribute to family life and social cohesion.\n\nFor the student, the experience of working in a museum, in close contact with curatorial and educational staff, will enhance professional skills which are relevant to future employment. In particular, he or she will participate in the cataloguing of the collection, the planning of exhibitions and displays, the production of educational and interpretive materials, and face-to-face interaction with visitors. The impact of such participation will be monitored through website statistics, attendance figures, visitor questionnaires and focus groups.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I023244/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
