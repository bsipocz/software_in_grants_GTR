(SHARPEN)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/L002787/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Secondary schools are important settings for health improvement, providing access to young people during a critical period when health risk behaviours markedly increase. Yet despite sustained effort to promote health through schools, the evidence for school-based interventions that effectively address issues such as obesity, smoking, alcohol use and mental health is limited. Health improvement research in school settings is challenging, with trials currently implemented in an ad hoc and inefficient manner. This is in stark contrast to research in primary care, which was greatly enhanced by the advent of primary care research networks (PCRNs) which facilitated an increase in the quantity and quality of randomised trials, improved research capacity and provided support for practitioner-led research. Such a step change is urgently needed to advance school-based research in the UK. 

The project aims to improve the quantity, quality and efficiency of public health research in schools by developing and evaluating a School Health Action Research Partnership and Network (SHARPEN). The research to evaluate and refine SHARPEN has 3 strands. In the first, researchers from Cardiff, Bristol, Oxford and Swansea universities will work in partnership with the Welsh Government, Cancer Research UK, Public Health Wales and Cardiff and Vale University Health Board to establish a network of up to 90 secondary schools that are 'trial ready', by developing more efficient recruitment, consent and data linkage procedures. We will identify the infrastructure and processes necessary to make the network efficient, effective, acceptable and rewarding for both schools and researchers. We will explore the barriers and facilitators to making the network sustainable. Students in network schools will complete the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey, a school environment schedule will be completed for each school, and we will pilot a system that uses these data as a basis for providing regular, tailored feedback to schools on pupil health behaviours and the school environment. 

In the second strand we will test the feasibility of establishing school-based action research partnerships to see whether they add significant value to the network model. Five schools will each form an action group of pupils, teachers, parents, health professionals and academics and over the course of a year each group will review their HBSC survey and school environemnt data, identify health priority areas, discuss the links between health and educational outcomes and develop and implement a school health action plan. Action plans will draw on the project partners and local resources and adopt a whole-school approach to health improvement. We will evaluate the action research partnerships to capture how they worked, the factors that hindered and helped them, and whether schools and other stakeholders found them feasible and useful. During this strand, student and parent views on data linkage will also be sought. Issues around informed consent and anonymity will be discussed with students and parents and if possible, data linkage will be piloted.

The aim of the third strand is to scope the potential for sustaining the network and expanding it in Wales and for transferring the network model to secondary schools in England. Lessons from the first two strands will be fed back to key stakeholders in England and Wales and their views will be sought on network sustainability and its potential for expansion. The development of new school health research networks in England and Wales has significant potential to coordinate, increase and strengthen school-based research and inform evidence-based school health activity, thereby contributing to young people's health in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Schools are important settings for young people's health improvement, but research in UK secondary schools has become increasingly challenging with health improvement intervention trials undertaken on an ad hoc basis. A network of 'trial ready' schools with research literate staff would support more efficient health improvement research that could better inform public health policy and practice in schools.
With the aim of facilitating a step change in the quantity and quality of school-based health improvement research and informed by the success of UK primary care research networks, this project will develop and evaluate a School Health Action Research Partnership and Network (SHARPEN) in Wales. Working with Welsh Government, NHS and third sector partners we will identify the infrastructure and processes needed to support SHARPEN through a staged scoping and feasibility study with 3 strands.
Strand 1 will establish and scope a basic school health research network (SHRN), using qualitative methods to explore staff, pupil and other stakeholder views on such issues as incentives to participate in SHRN and expectations of membership. New and efficient approaches to key elements of the research process, e.g. informed consent and whole school recruitment, will also be developed.
Strand 2 will explore the feasibility of an enhanced, action research partnerships (ARP) model to support knowledge transfer and development of research-practitioners in schools. Transdisciplinary school action groups will review student health behaviour data, then develop and implement action plans. The ARP model will be evaluated using a mixed methods process evaluation. The potential for linking student health behaviour data with other routinely collected datasets will also be explored.
Strand 3 will use surveys, interviews and consultation with policy and practice stakeholders to scope the barriers and facilitators to sustaining SHARPEN in Wales and the potential for transfer to England.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The SHRN aims to develop an infrastructure to improve the quantity and quality of school based health improvement trials, increase research capacity and support school based Transdisciplinary Action Research. To achieve this, the SHRN's partnership approach maximises impacts through ongoing, active engagement of policy, practice and public partners. If successful, impacts will accrue for academics, policy makers, school practitioners and, ultimately, the public. 

Academics 
Academics will benefit from the availability of a pool of research ready network schools, with streamlined consent procedures, systematic context data and data linkage to provide long term health and education outcomes. Involving policy, practice and public partners in intervention design, evaluation and translation will facilitate evaluations that retain scientific rigour and high external validity and maximise policy and practice impacts. 

Policy makers 
The strategic partnership will benefit policymakers through an improved evidence base for school health improvement, which will address current policy shortcomings in tackling priority health behaviours and addressing health inequalities. The SHRN's approach facilitates the development and evaluation of process based capacity building interventions to achieve sustainable whole system change. Important intermediate impacts will therefore focus on increases in policy, practice and public engagement in intervention development, evaluation and implementation. The network will provide a platform for longer-term impacts, with the identification of sustainable cost effective interventions addressing multiple risk behaviours. 

Practitioners
In pilot work, schools consistently highlighted impacts relating to improved pupil wellbeing. Schools will be better informed about pupil health behaviours and their school's health improvement activity, allowing them to formulate and support effective wellbeing plans tailored to their needs and capabilities. They also highlighted the benefits of school level data for school inspections of wellbeing activities. 
The network will also contribute to the continuing professional development of school staff in research literacy and evidence based practice and minimise school research burden through avoidance of low quality studies and imefficient research processes.
The strategic partnership with CR-UK also provides schools with curriculum enhancing activities. In turn, the network will provide CR-UK with opportunities to formulate and evaluate school engagement approaches to support cancer prevention activity throughout the UK. 

Public 
In the short term, pupils will benefit from CRUK resources enriching the STEM curriculum and a RCUK school engagement initiative facilitating extra-curricular activities. SHRN data will also be used in the classroom to promotes engagement in science and with pupil voice groups and parent teacher associations to enhance school engagement.
In the longer term, there has been increased policy recognition of the need for early years' interventions to address determinants of health, social and economic outcomes into later life. Schools have been identified as important in influencing child behaviours, health and wellbeing, so the SHRN's platform for evaluating school-based interventions is highly scientifically and policy relevant, with the potential to significantly affect population health and reduce inequalities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>402176</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ontario School of Public Health and Health Systems</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>University of Waterloo - establishment of Public Health Evaluation Institute</gtr:description><gtr:id>80769C53-B0A7-4281-8603-3DC9A594A7EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increased awareness and skills in evidence based practice and facilitation of policy evaluation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d830a50488c5.66677297-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint programme planning and delivery</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Capacity development for policy and practice in evidence based practice and evaluation</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cardiff and Vale University Health Board</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>School Health Research Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>78DE8447-426D-4EC3-B8B8-EB8BB3187DE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Network development event with 60 schools
