excess, with disease or disorders. There are over 30 diseases where research has made this
link. Current diagnosis is often dependent on the analysis of blood, saliva,urine and stools. It
can be
invasive or unpleasant for the individual, and there can be significant Laboratory delays in
obtaining results. A point of care hand held device capturing breath for speedy diagnosis and
management of disease has high potential for use by medical professionals and for home
monitoring.
Kanichi plans to develop a platform technology measuring chemicals in breath using
electrochemical sensors housed within a portable breath collection device. Our first target is
ammonia. This is because our initial market research showed that elevated levels of ammonia
have been associated with nine different medical conditions and as such a device could have
multiple applications. The two most attractive indications were determined to be the point of
care measurement of the effectiveness of dialysis in end stage renal disease, and in the
diagnosis of Helicobacter Pylori infection.
These two indications were extensively researched in 2013 through a TSM POM project. The
outcome was that a need was not established for the dialysis application but that strong
support was received from Medical consultants and researchers for a better method for
Helicobacter Pylori diagnosis and immediate treatment.
Kanichi has developed patented electrochemical sensors which measure at the required 100's
ppb level. We have also designed a concept for collection of the ammonia in breath for
presentation to the sensor. The purpose of this project is to prove this concept and develop a
basic working prototype in collaboration with an industrial partners specialising in gas sensing
and medical device development and marketing. We will also refine our knowledge of the
market space and determine our entry strategy</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>92413</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710485</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
