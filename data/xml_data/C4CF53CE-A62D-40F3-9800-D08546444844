It will make a significant contribution to both the emerging field of Comics Studies and the renewed academic interest in the subject of sovereignty within political philosophy and critical theory. The research will be of further benefit to academics in the areas of Critical Theory and Cultural Studies who are interested in developing a theory of the popular. As the research treats superhero comics as a repository of sophisticated responses to a tension that is experienced in everyday life and not an impoverished or deficient mode of literary expression in need of academic validation, the general orientation to the primary material will offer insights into how other popular forms might in turn contribute to academic debate. Too often popular forms are still seen as objects of criticism rather than as partners in a constructive dialogue. The primary outcome of the research is a monograph contracted to Manchester University Press for publication in 2012.\n\nFor over 70 years superheroes have been defending law and order against the forces of criminality and chaos. They have been fighting to protect a way of life against those that would destroy it. In this regard they represent the conventional picture of the sovereign. At another level, they also represent the transcendent moment that gives legitimacy to the law, that moment of divinity or pure, disinterested will that underpins our understanding of what is right. Related to this imposition of the law is the idea that the sovereign does not do away with violence, but has a monopoly over it. The sovereign is therefore the person that can use violence legitimately, a theme that recurs throughout the history of the superhero comic. More importantly the sovereign is also the person who decides when the law might be suspended, not least of all in retaliation for a crime committed or a conflict threatened. This brings into play the issue of states of emergency in which pre-emptive, and ordinarily extra-legal violence might be used to ensure the protection of a way of life. And nowhere is the problem more fully explored than in those pages where superhero comics address the extra-legal nature of their powers.\n\nAside from this conventional approach to issues pertaining to sovereignty, the research will aim to demonstrate that superhero comics also work with a fundamental intuition regarding the fragility of the worlds they supposedly protect, and that this intuition allows them to explore the contradiction that lies at the heart of sovereignty with a consistency and regularity that no other literary form has. The 'bad guys' in superhero comics are not simply vehicles through which the 'good guys' can show off their virtue, nor are they simply devices that allow writers to explore a superhero's darker side. The super-villains and forces of destruction that regularly threaten the world are the expression of a nihilative moment that no world can guard against forever. The stories in superhero comics reside in this dialogical tension between the need to create and preserve in the midst of a fundamentally entropic universe. Superhero comics are therefore a wonderful popular repository of attempts to think and act in the face of the anxieties brought on by this dialogism, or what I will call the contradiction of sovereignty, where sovereignty is at once both law and violence, creation and destruction, identity and dissolution. They have created a sophisticated visual language, and a popular theorization of a problem addressed in the political philosophy of Bodin, Hobbes, Schmitt, Derrida, Nancy, and Negri, amongst others. The aim of the research is to show the contribution that superhero comics can make to these debates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Aside from the potential for impact within the academy due to the innovative approach the research takes to both superhero comics and the approach to sovereignty in the areas of Critical Theory and Political Philosophy, this research has the potential to deliver a range of benefits for a number of different social sectors. In order to maximise these I plan a number of additional outputs, the aims and objectives of which will complement the impact of the monograph and permit me to take the research in new and productive directions engaging groups, communities and institutions beyond the university.\n\nThe first of the pathways to impact for this research will be a symposium in September 2011 to celebrate 50 years of the Marvel universe. The symposium will run for one day and will include international and national academic speakers. It will also include talks by British-based writers and artists; plus discussions by people in comics retail, including owners of the Nottingham comic shop, Page 45, and a representative from OK Comics in Leeds. It is anticipated that there will also be input from within the industry itself. Marvel have indicated that they would be willing to consider supporting the symposium. A broad focus of the symposium is designed to appeal to a wide audience including fans, retailers, academics and those working within the industry. The proceedings of the conference would not only be submitted for publication to academic journals, but the reviews of the event and some of the material presented would also be disseminated via Page 45's website.\n\nThe impact of such a symposium has the potential to be far-reaching. Not only would it help connect the university to communities beyond the campus, it would also foster profitable connections between academics and the industry in ways that would be mutually rewarding. The symposium would also be part of a wider engagement with partners outside the University including Nottingham Contemporary with whom I have started discussions regarding the inclusion of talks on comics into their public programming. More recently Christine McSween from the Broadway Cinema in Nottingham has contacted me with a view to developing a collaborative project on screen adaptations of comics.\n\nAnother important pathway to impact would be the teaching I have volunteered through the Workers' Educational Association (WEA). This is part of an ongoing discussion regarding the ways in which they can develop a set of cultural studies and critical theory courses for the adult learning/continuing education courses. The WEA is a third sector organization the prides itself on being the largest voluntary provider of adult and community learning in the UK. It is committed to widening participation, removing barriers to learning and promoting learning for life. In line with this I have offered to teach a ten week course on comics in which this research will feature strongly. This course will help me to access reading and learning communities beyond the usual fan communities, and will help facilitate autonomous learning groups in the future. It is anticipated that groups such as informal reading groups will emerge as a by-product of this course. I am also currently in discussions with the Community Partnerships Office at the University to address how the University might also provide spaces for such groups to meet, thereby complying to its own obligations to widening participation.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>43833</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>On Sovereignty and Superheroes</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>0A183CC5-F526-432C-BCB0-69074A7E1F2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The nature of sovereignty in superhero comics

This was a series of four talks to different years in the same primary school that looked at the way superheroes might be used to address issues of conflict and friendship.

These include the relationship between violence and the law; states of emergency; distinctions between friend and enemy; questions of legitimacy and foundation; the use of pre-emptive action; authority and kinship structures; nationalism and cosmopolitanism; truth and justice. This makes them a very useful form of popular narrative when read against the backdrop of the war on terror and the changing nature of militarism in the 21st century. The research has shown that while these comics are understood to be inherently conservative, if not themselves militaristic, the reality is far more complicated showing that these popular visual narratives offer very challenging accounts of the various social, political and environmental problems that currently face us. While the issue of terrorism has been prevalent in comic books from the 1960s they have always worked with a concept of networked terror that only came into popular consciousness in the first decade of the 21st century. This prescient view also makes them especially adept at working with the security issues we face today. As such the research shows that more than any other popular form superhero comics have offered a sustained, critical engagement with these issues that is often overlooked.

While superhero comics reflect many of the issues that are normally addressed in the study of sovereignty (traditional political philosophy can easily be mapped onto these stories) they also transcend traditional political thinking by making the creation and destruction of worlds their central concerns. By this I do not simply means the physical destruction of objective worlds, but the creation and destruction of worlds understood as value systems or systems of meaning. What is interesting about these stories is that superheroes always fight for something, but their world can be destroyed far more catastrophically by undermining a belief than destroying a building. In addition to this, despite the perceived jingoism of superhero stories they carry a fundamental intuition about the fragility of the world as a meaning system. They not only fight bad guys who don't value what they value, but beings that represent the very power of entropy itself. This threat of dissolution is never finally defeated, and while cynics would say this is because the serial form of comics can never accommodate an end it is also because writers of superhero comics understand this very simple and fundamental contradiction at the heart of sovereignty that while the sovereign must defend the world, occasionally by any means necessary, each sovereign is faced by all-powerful entropic forces that cannot be ultimately and finally defeated. As such these stories speak to a basic human frailty regarding the wonderful but potentially fleeting worlds we build. As such they can make a valid contribution to our thinking about sovereignty not only because they are interesting stories, but because the story is itself so central to the sovereign worlds we construct. The world war that superhero comics regularly play out is one between competing world-views where, at their most conservative a specific worldview (a largely American or Western one will prevail), but this world war is also a meditation on the truth that worlds are simply 'views' or stories and that they rest on little else. This is why the threat of entropy is so real because even in the midst of our most regular and habitual routines we can become susceptible to the feeling that nothing really seems to make sense and our world can begin to slip away. The research would both compliment but also seriously challenge the conservative approach to international relations proffered by Samuel Huntington's thesis of a clash of civilizations. While this theory argued for the need to understand the cultural component in international conflict it nevertheless privileged one culture over others. Superhero comics are a brilliant vehicle for considering this cultural component (in the shape of stories, values, beliefs and meanings) while also showing that no culture can claim the rights over this cultural creativity. The clash of civilizations is a deeply relativizing phenomenon where what was thought to be true is undermined in the clash and threatened with dissolution. In such a situation violence is almost certainly the outcome as one world seeks to annihilate the other. Because superheroes effectively reside in this tension between the need to defend something and the fact that this world appears to be built on sand they are excellent vehicles for working through such clashes. Superhero comics function in this permanently entropic environment and ask us to think about how we might live when everything that is solid might melt into air.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings could be very useful for setting up discussions in both primary and secondary schools.

The findings could also be part of discussion amongst comic book readers.

Comic creators and those working in the industry would find this useful.
