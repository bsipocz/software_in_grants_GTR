The objective will be to engineer hybrid panels with high structural integrity and dent resistance that are at least 30% lighter than their monolithic steel counterparts whilst imparting shape memory and deformation rate dependant properties. The intention is to produce a panel with a formed metal 'A' class surface backed with a polymer inner layer. The polymer backing layer will enable the use of significantly thinner metal sheet thus providing significant weight saving. The hybrid panels will be produced using standard polymer injection moulding technology with the metal sheet being formed into the tool by the pressure of the injected polymer (cf. sheet hydroforming) with the polymer being moulded to the back of the metal substrate using micro scale mechanical interlocking. Take up of the technology would have a significant environmental impact by reducing tail pipe emissions and there is significant potential for improved pedestrian safety as a result of improved impact performance of components such as the car bonnet. If this technology was adopted on a single component (i.e. bonnet) with 250k units a year this would save in the order of 1.5 million kg of CO2 per annum. Additionally, the novel manufacturing techniques developed in this project will be a key enabler in the delivery of new product concepts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We believe a technology that will provide body panel with significant weight reduction (30%) with no cost penalties and ease of manufacture will have a high likelihood of widespread take up with consequent economic benefits to the UK.

Additionally, the novel manufacturing techniques developed in this project will be a key enabler in the delivery of new product concepts. The market for body panels is dominated by traditional pressed metal structures with some injection moulded parts in no critical components. The introduction of hybrid panels would be disruptive in this risk averse industry and could dominate body panel construction for foreseeable future. Furthermore it could revolutionise car design freeing the engineer from the conventional constraints of tradition forming and fabrication technologies. The initial target products would be door, bonnets and roof structures where the structural and safety benefits would be maximised. These products constitute 75% of the body in white. A successful proof of concept project would lead to its demonstration in a beacon electric vehicle by 2013. The research is of direct benefit to the automotive OEMs and supply chain. Given the unique features that the panels would provide initial take-up would be likely in the premium automotive sector with such companies as Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin. The introduction of these panels would enable the OEMs to deliver higher efficiency vehicles with unique selling points. Within the supply chain automotive sheet manufacturers (such as Corus) would benefit as a result by securing market share with the introduction of new products combating threats from light alloys and polymerics. Injection moulding companies (such as Plastic Omnium) would benefit through the increased number of panels being produced using this route, and polymer suppliers (such as Sabic) would benefit as a result of increased sales of specialist polymers. There is also potential for this technology to be exploited in other transport industries (aerospace, rail, marine etc) where the weight reduction and unique properties offered by these hybrid panels would be extremely beneficial. The research fellow employed to conduct the research will be in a unique position to gain experience in both polymer injection moulding and metal forming technologies and develop a knowledge base related to polymer/metal adhesion, and the mechanical behaviour of smart polymers. The research fellow will also benefit from regular interaction with automotive OEMs and supply chain companies. This position would provide a good foundation for a career in academia, the automotive industry, or the polymer/metal forming industry. Given the multi-material nature of the project both investigators will also benefit from participation in the project, with Prof Dashwood gaining exposure to the significant polymer processing expertise of Prof Smith, with metals processing expertise transferring in the opposite direction. This will significantly enhance the ability of both investigators to develop further multi-material products and processes in the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>171810</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Using a shape recovery test developed during this project it was shown that the SMP samples recovered 99-100% of their original shape when bent by 6.4mm, 12.8mm and 19.2mm. The hybrid counterparts recovered around 97% when tested in the same manner. Internal stresses stored in the materials from the injection moulding process appear to cause some lateral distortion when the SMP is recovering its permanent shape. Although a SMP-Al hybrid material can recover a significant proportion of its permanent shape, even when deformed by 19.2mm, SMPs only exhibit the shape memory effect when deformed under very particular conditions. There is a conflict between the temperature profile undergone during the deformation that would occur to an automotive body panel (at ambient temperature) and the &amp;quot;shape memory creation process&amp;quot; required to ensure that the permanent shape is recoverable. The &amp;quot;shape memory creation process requires deformation to occur above the materials transition temperature and to be maintained while the material is cooled and this does not happen during an automotive collision. The cost calculations carried out as part of this project are prohibitive to this type of hybrid material being utilised in a commercially available vehicle and as such this particular hybrid materials system would be unsuitable for engineering automotive body panels from.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further research required.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D1212CCA-8370-4C8B-B2D9-2953CA685620</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8395721827.0709017797b06e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H050167/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>748617DE-4AB0-42C9-9514-B22ECFBE05E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transport Ops &amp; Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
