Haemoglobin contains two proteins called alpha- and beta-globin which are individually found in a chain-like form. Normally these proteins are evenly balanced. When this balance is disrupted, anaemia can occur, which is usually defined as a reduction in the number of red cells or amount of haemoglobin in the blood.

Beta-thalassaemia is a common form of inherited anaemia caused by reduced production of beta-globin chains. The disrupted balance in the alpha and beta-globin chains results in excess unpaired alpha-chains. These cause damage to the developing red cells and are the major cause of the anaemia. Most patients are treated with regular blood transfusions but this is problematic. They have to be given every few weeks, come with their own side-effects and can lead to the build up of iron in the body which can cause significant problems. Whilst treatments for the symptoms are available, beta-thalassaemia causes thousands of premature deaths each year. We know that individuals with beta-thalassaemia have a much milder form of the disease if they co-inherit alpha-thalassaemia: as well as reduced number of beta-globin chains they also have a reduction in the alpha-globin chains. This leads to a reduction in the amount of alpha-globin that is unpaired and so an improvement in the imbalance between the globin chains.

In our project we plan to achieve the same result; the reduction of alpha-globin in individuals with beta-thalassaemia by modifying genetic sequences that control the production of alpha-globin. This is done by removing blood from an affected individual, isolating the rare stem cells which develop into red cells, and genetically modifying them before reintroducing them to the patient. My aim is to develop this editing process by finding out which parts of the genetic sequence we should modify and which cells from the patient we should edit in order to make the process efficient and acceptable for use. We hope that if we are successful our project can be a model for developing cures for a wide range of genetic diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Beta-thalassaemia is an inherited anaemia caused by reduced or absent production of the haemoglobin component beta-globin. Despite being one of the first molecular diseases to have its pathophysiology characterised, the management of beta-thalassaemia is far from optimal, limited to supportive therapy for the majority. We know that the unbalanced production of globin chains and subsequent excess of alpha-globin chains are the central causative factors in the pathophysiology of this condition. Currently, most attempts to ameliorate beta-thalassaemia aim to resolve globin imbalance by increasing gamma-globin production.

In this project we aim to take a complementary approach; the reduction of excess alpha-globin chains, as natural reductions of alpha-globin output, in the form of co-inherited alpha-thalassaemia, ameliorate the disease phenotype in beta-thalassaemia patients. To achieve this reduction, the major regulatory element controlling alpha-globin expression will be deleted using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Proof-of-principle experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. 

We hope to develop the efficient editing of long term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and have two complimentary aims:
1) To optimise gene-editing of the MCS-R2 enhancer by identifying the key sequences that need to be disrupted to achieve the ideal level of alpha-globin knock-down. This will be done through generating a guide-RNA library to edit various transcription factor binding sites, using a newly developed Cas9 derivative that allows for flexibility in the PAM specificities required for CRISPR/Cas9 editing.
2) To identify which sub-population of stem cells have long-term repopulating ability. Evidence suggests that the CD49f+ fraction of CD34+ cells are enriched in LT-HSCs. We will use a xenograft mouse model to evaluate whether improved editing efficiency and long-term repopulation can be achieved by editing this purified CD49f+ sub-population alone.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In 2008 the WHO estimated that 60,000 children are born every year with the severe beta-thalassaemia. The disease can place a heavy socioeconomic burden on low-income and developing nations. This impact can be significant even in developed countries like the UK, where patients may expect to live to 50 years. The undiscounted lifetime cost of treatment was estimated by one group in 1999 to be &amp;pound;803,002. Regular treatment involves transfusions every 2-3 weeks, so the economic cost in terms of missed employment days for the patient and carers will add to the total economic burden. The disruption to working and living patterns as well as the array of symptoms can impact heavily on their quality of life. Our project would lift economic and QoL burden by offering a cure. Whilst difficult to give an exact figure, given current costs of autologous stem cell transplants, we would expect the final therapeutic application to cost well under &amp;pound;100,000, and for patients to avoid the debilitating symptoms they may otherwise develop. This project would go some way to developing a safe gene-therapy for thalassaemia. Our findings will become available through conferences and formal publications within 2-3 years, so we would expect to see a human trial within 10 years.

The global prevalence of monogenic diseases at birth is approximately 1/100, with acquired genetic disorders (such as malignancy) eventually occurring in the majority of the UK population. CRISPR/Cas9 therapies offer hope for a cure for many of these. Our project, which will stand as a model, will benefit researchers who wish to develop similar therapies. Many of the techniques we will be employing can be used for other disorders, and so the overall impact could be highly significant. Our findings would be available for dissemination from 2-3 years onwards, with early clinical translation in 10-20 years.

As the above implies, the worldwide commercial benefits from gene-therapies may be huge. Biotechnology firms have eviously benefited from basic research to develop cures using other RNA-guided endonucleases, so we would expect the same to apply with CRISPR/Cas9 therapies. The development of a cure for beta-thalassaemia (as well as for other diseases) is likely to reap significant economic dividends, which will be felt locally particularly if the firms are based in the UK.

Gene therapies have been on the therapeutic horizon for many years, but delivering an efficient cure has been a significant obstacle yet to be routinely hurdled. We hope our work will go some way to addressing this, helping to develop an efficient and cost-effective treatment that will be attractive to funding and regulatory bodies. Our data will be available for review by regulatory bodies such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency that consider the approval of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products. Our findings will be disseminated 2-3 years from the start of the project, and will be available for groups that seek to bring this therapy to human trial. 

This CTRF offers an invaluable opportunity for the proposer to gain an array of research skills; laboratory techniques such as cell culture, flow cytometry, qPCR, cloning, gene editing and use of bioinformatics, as well as generic skills such as resource management, scientific writing, data analysis and experimental methodology. As I plan to work as an academic clinician, the skills and experience gathered in this fellowship will benefit patients, co-workers and students, including future CTRF beneficiaries. The fellowship will benefit clinical services as well as the host research group, as returning to clinical practice should help the exchange of ideas and resources, particularly as my clinical area involves some of the highest volume of red cell haematology work in the UK, a field which is the primary focus of the host laboratory.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>253741</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P019633/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>939798CA-B6AE-4C12-9DCC-A0F88F84E6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Blood</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>DD81206B-5EB4-4BCC-AEF7-808A64606E0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.2  Cellular and gene therapies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
