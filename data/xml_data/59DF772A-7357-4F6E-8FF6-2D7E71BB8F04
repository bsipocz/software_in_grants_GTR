New CATH methods will predict their functions. 

Whilst other resources do also predict function, CATH-Gene3D (referred to below as CATH) provides unique information on structurally conserved features linked to function. Structure data reveals how proteins perform their function and why the function changes if the protein is modified by mutations or other genetic variations. Protein function information is key to understanding biological systems and by extension drug design, protein engineering and disease.

CATH is a world leading resource that classifies proteins evolved from the same ancestral protein, into evolutionary families. Currently, CATH classifies 15 million protein domains into 2600 families. Family data is valuable because evolutionary relatives (called homologues) tend to have similar 3D structures and perform similar functions. Thus the benefit of CATH is the ability to infer properties between homologues.

This is important because of the millions of proteins currently known (&amp;gt;20 million) less than 5% have experimentally determined functions. Even in the organism of greatest interest to us, human, &amp;lt;10% of proteins have known functions. Because it can be slow and very expensive to characterise proteins it will not be possible to experimentally study all these proteins. Therefore, biologists use CATH to predict the function of a protein based on the family to which it belongs.

Another fact is that proteins are made up of 'domains' - on average two per protein. These are independently folded entities that act together to confer the function of the whole protein. CATH classifies proteins at the level of the domain and currently classifies ~70% of domains found in nature. Domains are the building blocks of proteins - a few thousand of them are combined in different ways to give the 20 million proteins, or more, in nature. Our group develops methods for predicting domain functions. This allows functions of whole proteins to be deduced from the functions of their constitutive domains. Thus functions can be suggested for proteins made from any combination of domains.

CATH uses information on the 3D structure of the domain to give more accurate family classifications, as structure is more highly conserved, during evolution, than the sequence. Even more important - structure can reveal how the protein performs its function and whether the protein loses its function if a mutation occurs at a particular site.

We will expand CATH by 100%. Since manual validation is very time consuming, we will develop better methods for automatically recognising distant homologues. We will continuously release data (CATH-B), prior to manual curation, so that biologists can benefit from the information much sooner.

We will collaborate with the other major structure classification SCOP to develop common classification strategies and provide complementary information on families.

We will improve the accuracy of functional inheritance across a family. We need to do this because in some families, especially those occurring more frequently in nature, the functions can change in some relatives.

We will improve accuracy by characterising important positions in the domain, conserved across functionally similar relatives. We can build patterns of these positions to recognise other domains sharing such patterns and likely to have similar functions.

We will make it easy for biologists to use our web search tool to determine if a protein belongs to one of these functional families. We will set this up on the Cloud so that biologists can quickly search CATH with the massive datasets they obtain using new sequencing technologies. These technologies capture proteins expressed under different conditions. Our web pages will report their functions and variations in the protein which could modify function causing disease</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>(1) CATHifier
We will build the CATHifier platform for classifying structures/sequences in CATH-Gene3D (referred to below as CATH). This will comprise a better homologue predictor exploiting more powerful sequence matching (meta-methods), structure matching (meta-methods) and function matching (text mining). We will improve the machine learning SVM combining this data. 

CATHifier will comprise RESTful web services and Cloud based workflows. We will make CATHifier available via webservers for user's queries. The web services will also export CATH data to PDB and InterPro. 

(2) More sensitive methods for functional classification
Our functional classification/prediction tool (FunFamer) will be improved eg by using MDA data, better detection of conserved residues, looking for 3D co-localisation of conserved residues, exploiting conserved 3D motifs. 

(3) FunFamer webserver for function prediction
Most proteins are not experimentally characterised and so function prediction is a major aim of the project. High Performance Compute (HPC) strategies will handle the vast datasets biologists are generating using next gen sequencing. 

A recent BBSRC T&amp;amp;R pilot ported FunFamer to HPC facilities ie Amazon and UCL Legion (5500 nodes). We used infrastructure-on-demand services ie Amazon EC2 compute cloud and Amazon S3 storage service. Amazon virtual machines can be used in a cluster-like scenario via Sun SGE's 'cloud adapter' software or in parallel. We will improve scheduling for large datasets and explore using Hadoop and related strategies.

A major aim will be intuitive web pages displaying functions. No other resources identify structure-based functional families. We will show 3D structures highlighting functional sites conserved in both sequence and structure. We have begun this but more work is needed eg to make the site more intuitive, align query proteins against FunFams, display mutations close to functional sites or splice variations modifying function</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We will maintain and develop a world leading resource for protein domain structure classification (CATH-Gene3D, henceforth referred to as CATH) which combines 3D structure data, tens of millions of sequences predicted to belong to CATH families and extensive information on protein functions. We will improve the purity of functional classification and thereby increase the value of the resource for both basic biosciences and also the agricultural and biomedical communities. 

CATH already has a very well developed website and this will be extended to provide more detailed information on protein functions and in particular residue sites on the protein surface likely to be important for function. The new web pages will therefore inform protein design or rationalise the impacts of genetic variation eg in different plant or animal strains. For example a single residue mutation in the Rubisco protein, affecting allostery, can alter the catalytic efficiency of this enzyme in rice and promote survival in arid regions.

CATH is already widely used - The website now receives nearly 2 million web-pages accesses/month from ~61,000 unique visitors and the CATH paper is highly cited - the original CATH Structure paper is now cited 1986 times (all CATH publications are cited 6413 times).

Communities in which CATH has an impact

Basic bioscience researchers: Evidenced by the fact that CATH is one of the 8 member groups of InterPro - a consortium of major protein family resources at the EBI. Several European networks of excellence (Biosapiens, EMBRACE, IMPACT, ENFIN) included the CATH group to provide structural/functional annotations for genome sequences. 

Structural biologists: Evidenced by the fact that major protein structure repositories (PDB) link directly to CATH; a major structural genomics initiative (PSI) in the States selected CATH as the structural resource for target selection.

Biomedical Researchers: Evidenced by the fact that CATH is used to provide information on protein functions, protein networks and the impacts of SNPs for large consortia researching neuropathic pain (London Pain Consortium, Europain).

Other evidence of impact is given by the range of support letters including letters from directors of major institutes (eg RCSB, EBI), companies undertaking genome annotation (eg Synthetic Genomics) and users of the data.

Research fields in which CATH will have an Impact

Agricultural and Food security - Protein sequencing initiatives are providing increasing amounts of data for plants, crops, cattle and the bacteria that interact with these hosts and cause damage. The data and tools we will develop (eg information on conserved positions involved in function) will explain variations between strains and help identify suitable strains to improve yields, taste or colour or to cope with environmental conditions eg drought, pests and pathogens.

Protein design and biotech industries - modification of proteins in pathways can yield new sources of materials and energy (ie biofuels). New proteins can be designed to build synthetic pathways. The functional family (FunFam) data can be used to constrain conserved structural core positions in the protein and identify positions more tolerant to change and useful for new designs. 

Health - Knowledge of structural details in the active sites of proteins and identification of conserved 3D features is valuable for drug design. Another major benefit will be the use of conservation data in FunFams to rationalise the impact of genetic variations (eg SNPs, spliced variations) on protein functions and disease susceptibility. This will inform both diagnostic strategies and drug design. 

The FunFam server will characterise the functional repertoire of metagenomes from human cavities eg gut and thereby help explain the role of commensal bacteria in promoting health.

This is evidenced by the web access stats of nearly 2 million web page accesses per month from more than 10,000 unique visitors. It is widely used as a teaching tool to explain the principles of protein evolution and structure-function relationships.

The CATH data has been used by the following organisations and consortia:
1. Midwest Structural Genomics Consortium to analyse protein families and target structurally uncharacterised families with relevance to human health for structure determination
2. Centre for Structural Genomics in Disease to target protein families implicated in virulence of pathogenic organisms for structure determination 
3. The London Pain Consortum to predict associations between protein families in order to understand the protein networks/signalling pathways involved in neuropathic pin
4. The Europain consortium to provide information on protein families implicated in neuropathic pain.
5. The Protein Databank to provide information on domain structure families 

CATH algorithms and data have also been widely used by researchers in industry:
CATH was one of the four major UCL bioinformatics resources used to establish the UCL company Inpharmatica in 1998. This was involved in predicting structures and functions for proteins via the 'Biopendium'. Inpharmatica sold this and other related software packages to several large pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer, Astra Zeneca and Glaxo-Wellcome. Inpharmatica was acquired by Galapagos in 2006.

The main structure comparison algorithms developed by the CATH team (CATHEDRAL) has been distributed directly to Pharma including UCB Celltech LB, Pfizer India, Cubist, DE Shaw, Signal Pharmaceuticals, Astellas, Adimab, Molecular Health and BioCrea.

For example, UCB has licensed CATHEDRAL and PDBsum and ~20 of their employees have directly used these resources. The Director of Computational Structural Biology stated &amp;quot;All these tools work together nicely to turn protein structural information into a more digestible form, which speeds up our work process, accelerates knowledge dissemination and facilitates more informed decision making for the research and development of both small molecule and antibody therapeutics. CATHEDRAL not only offers superior performance in this type of comparison, but also automatically specifies domain boundaries for a multi-domain query through an iterative search strategy. This unique feature has saved us hundreds of man-hours by eliminating the need for manual correction when structurally characterizing potential drug targets of multiple domains&amp;quot;.

Papers exploiting CATH data and published by Thornton and Orengo have been cited 13 times across 11 patent documents (assessed in the 2008 to 2014, ie. Research Exercise Framework (REF) in the UK), indicating the commercial relevance of their work. The patents are filed across the USA, Europe and Internationally through the PCT system and are assigned to GSK Ltd, Biogen Idec Inc. and Pharnext.

The CEO of Acpharis has stated: &amp;quot;Protein structure data is core to our research and we rely on fold libraries and HMM data from CATH and related resources to answer the fundamental questions that we are addressing in designing drugs for novel targets, hopefully allowing design of more novel drugs that can better treat a variety of diseases. CATH provides a valuable service to the academic and commercial sectors and is a key resource for analyzing structures and collecting the information necessary for innovative drug design&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:id>90F690D6-B372-45E9-880F-E1BF9FF35709</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54647b63f06749.70274513</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>This was developed from a double dynamic algorithm, SSAP, used for structure comparison.

In the 2 years that this project has been running we have:

1) Developed a new algorithm for recognising homologous domains based on machine learning (SVM) that combines information on protein sequences and protein structures. This is capable of providing accurate automated assignments for an additional 60,000 structural domains in CATH, increasing the total coverage by over 15%
2) Provided an improved method (FunFHMMER) for functional sub-classification - this groups together protein domains that have similar patterns of residue conservation indicative of common functional sites. 
3) Independently validated the function prediction potential of FunFHMMER by submitting annotations to CAFA (international function prediction assignment). This method was ranked 1st out of 129 methods for predicting molecular function and 2nd for predicting biological process (using the most stringent metric)
4) Completed two major releases of the CATH database. The latest version (v4.1) now contains over 300,000 structural domains (almost doubling the number of domains annotated before this grant started). 
5) Putative domain structure assignments are now available to the public (CATH-B) which provides the very latest annotations for new structures in the PDB (updated daily).
6) Updated the number of predicted domain structures in CATH-Gene3D cover 20,000 cellular genomes and over 43 million domain entries. This represents a two fold increase since the project started. 
7) CATH-Gene3D data has been updated with new functional information and information on protein interactions from a range of public sources eg IRefIndex, GO, EC, REACTOME etc. 
8) Used the new functional family groupings in CATH-Gene3D to create 3D models for human sequences (without known structure) that are significantly more accurate than models generated using more established methods (eg HHpred). This work has been accepted for publication by Acta Crystallographica, a journal widely read by structural biologists who use CATH.
9) Used these predicted structures to model protein-protein interactions for human proteins. 
10) Additionally, the structural models have been expanded to include an extra model organism (Drosophila melanogaster). 
11) Added splicing data into Gene3D allowing structural and functional interpretations of alternative splicing.
12) Expanded our coverage of disease associated human mutations to the much larger set integrated by UniProt and included additional visualization tools in the website. For example it is now easier to see where the mutations are on the domains. Furthermore, for a number of binary protein interactions there is information on sub-regions of the proteins that participate or influence the interaction. Many of these sub-regions overlap with domain regions in Gene3D. Using this data we can see which mutations are likely disrupt protein interactions. 
13) Provided new CATH-Gene3D web-pages to show the relationships between functional families within a superfamily.
14) Added new visualization tools in the Gene3D website. 
15) Progressed the mapping between CATH and SCOP to facilitate more rapid annotation of sequences in InterPro and to improve the accuracy of both resources
16) The improved mapping protocols have increased the number of superfamilies deemed to be equivalent in the two resources from 19% to 39% (732 superfamilies)
17) Improved structure comparison algorithm to allow domains to be superposed more accurately than previously possible - highlighting the highly-conserved ancient structural core across large and diverse groups of proteins
18) Provided a major release of the DomainFinder algorithm (v4.0) which identifies the optimum domain assignments from a mixed set of sequence search results. This new CATH-Resolve-Hits algorithm is being adopted by the InterPro project.
19) These discoveries and developments have been published in 14 journal articles and 4 textbook chapters</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>CATH-Gene3D is a member database in the widely accessed InterPro resource hosted at the EBI, which has more than 5 million webpage accesses per month. It is one of only two resources (out of 11 in InterPro) providing structural annotations and is therefore important for providing consensus information on predicted structural regions in protein sequences. The mapping between CATH and SCOP will therefore be very useful for InterPro researchers integrating the information on structural annotations.
 
CATH classification data is valuable for a number of general activities undertaken by biologists/biomedical researchers:
- assigning structures or functions to uncharacterised proteins (as mentioned above)
- providing information on conserved and variable structural regions in domain families. This data is important information in drug design (ie for designing compounds that bind to proteins in pathogenic organisms but not in human).
- the multiple alignment data in CATH is valuable for identifying highly conserved positions in a family and likely functional sites. This data is helpful in assessing the likely impacts of genetic variations, nsSNPs etc.
- the up-to-date and comprehensive structural libraries provided by CATH are valuable for searching against to find structural analogs for a query structure that may represent cross-hits for a drug designed to bind to the query. 
- CATH-Gene3D is the only structure based resource providing functional families (FunFams currently ~100,000) which group together domain sequences likely to have highly similar structures and functions. We have established a web search tool that allows users to scan new sequences against a library of HMMs for these families in order to obtain predicted functional annotations for their protein.
 
The developments in our structure comparison algorithm, highlighting conservation across remote evolutionary relationships, is the basis of collaboration with a large pharmaceutical company and this work will continue to be significant in the field of drug design.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>990BE467-F54F-488F-B53E-7DA56A6C6C14</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54647b0f821022.93508745</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cathdb.info</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Structural Bioinformatics Consortium (ELIXIR)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A7A9A56-7165-4443-B609-C8571D351E87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are part of a consortium of 17 research groups developing training material in structural bioinformatics.

CATH-Gene3D is a domain family classification. As of 2015, 55 million protein domain sequences are classified into evolutionary superfamilies. Within these, relatives are further classed into groups in which relatives share very similar 3D-structures and functional properties. These groupings are described as functional families - FunFams.

The latest version of the CATH-Gene3D protein structure classification database has recently been released (version 4.1, http://www.cathdb.info). The resource comprises over 300 000 domain structures and over 53 million protein domains classified into 2737 homologous superfamilies, doubling the number of predicted protein domains in the previous version. The daily-updated CATH-B, which contains our very latest domain assignment data, provides putative classifications for over 100 000 additional protein domains.

Gene3D http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk is a database of domain annotations of Ensembl and UniProtKB protein sequences. Domains are predicted using a library of profile HMMs representing 2737 CATH superfamilies. The current Gene3D (v14) release has expanded its domain assignments to ~20 000 cellular genomes and over 43 million unique protein sequences, more than doubling the number of protein sequences since our last publication. Amongst other updates, we have improved our Functional Family annotation method. We have also improved the quality and coverage of our 3D homology modelling pipeline of predicted CATH domains.

This was previously done by the DFX algorithm which used function annotation data from the Gene Ontology to sub-classify the superfamilies into FunFams. However, due to the paucity of the GO terms and annotation biases existing in the GO, a new approach, FunFHMMer, for functionally classifying CATH superfamilies was developed which exploits sequence patterns, and is therefore unaffected by the limitations of GO. FunFHMMer, determines an optimal cut of a hierarchical clustering tree of sequence relatives within a given superfamily by calculating a novel functional coherence index based on conserved positions and specificity-determining positions (SDPs) in sequence alignments. This results in generation of more functionally coherent functional families or FunFams than our previous classification.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F3F7DCC2-3D0D-4A84-82AB-A0576F422FD9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CATH-Gene3D FunFams are able to provide functional annotations for nearly 16 million domain sequences in UniProtKB and Ensembl.

FunFams can be used to predict residues implicated in functional sites. CATH FunFams are also useful for analysing the variation in functions across a superfamily and since functional sites can be identified for many FunFams, they allow a structurally informed analysis of the mechanisms of this divergence.
