Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N020111/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project addresses mainly the Human Factors challenge of the joint Singapore-UK call, and it has an interdisciplinary team with expertise in cyber security, cognitive psychology, and human-computer interface (HCI). It aims at producing direct evidence that human behaviour related insecurity can be detected automatically by applying human cognitive models to model and simulate humans involved in security systems. A key outcome of the project will be a working software system that can be used for this purpose by researchers and practitioners. The project will focus on human user authentication systems as a representative use case and will produce new knowledge on the role of human behaviours in such systems and security systems in general. Both the software framework and new knowledge on human behaviours can also help address other challenges of the call (e.g., detection of intruders/extremists requires knowledge on how they behave; protection of user privacy require knowledge on how human users handle personal data; policy makers need to understand behaviours of their organisations' employees and human attackers targeting their organisations to make more informed decisions).

It has been well known that human factors are a very important aspect of cyber security, as recognised by governments all over the world e.g., in the UK Cyber Security Strategy (2011), in Singapore's National Cyber Security Masterplan 2018 (2013), and in the US Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan (2011). Human related insecurity is often related to intended or unintentional (maybe subconscious) insecure human behaviours. To conduct research on human behaviours (in cyber security, HCI, psychology and other related fields), researchers normally depend on involvement of real human users via surveys, interviews, simulated scenarios, observations of real cases, interactive games, or other specially designed user studies. Such approaches are often time-consuming and costly, and suffer from other issues like limited and/or biased samples, questionable ecological validity, difficulties in reproducing results, and impossibility of running some studies due to ethical/privacy/legal concerns.

This project aims at developing the first (to the best our knowledge) general-purpose computational framework and supporting software tools that will enable automatic detection of human behaviour related insecurity at the HCI level without the need to involve real human users. The framework will be built on computational models of human cognitive processes, HCIs, human behaviour related attacks and (in)security measures. The framework will be non-intrusive: instead of evaluating the running system itself, the framework will evaluate an abstract executable model of the system and humans involved. Removing real human users from the process allows faster and more objective inspection of potential insecurity of a given security system. The automated process can still be combined with traditional user studies to make better use of limited resources in automatically detecting potential insecurity problems deserving further manual analysis.

The framework and software tools developed will be of great value for cyber security researchers, security system designers/developers and security industry to deliver securer systems to end users. As a natural byproduct, they will also allow easier evaluation of usability of security and non-security related computer systems with an HCI. As we mentioned above in this summary, people having concerns on other challenges of the call can benefit from the project's outcomes as well.

In this project we will focus mainly on HCI-level (&amp;quot;micro&amp;quot;) human behaviours, but possible extensions to higher-level (&amp;quot;macro&amp;quot;) behaviours (e.g., how human users adapt their behaviours over time via rehearsals and learning) will be looked at as well to pave the way for our future research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; field of the Je-S form explains the expected academic impact in detail, so here we focus on economic and societal impact.

While the project is targeting mainly researchers, we will make the software framework accessible to non-researchers as well so it can help security system designers and developers, and security industry in general to check human behaviour related insecurity problems at the HCI level in the design stage of their security products and services. Even when user studies are still needed to evaluate their products and services' performance, the software framework can help identify key areas they need to pay more attention to and thus making a better use of the limited resources. This, on one hand, can help enhance the research capacity, knowledge and skills and efficiency of security industry to deliver securer security products and services, and on the other hand can improve the overall experience and quality of life of end users by reducing security incidents that can be avoided before such products and services are introduced into the real world. If it is possible to collect more realistic (and anonymous) information about human users using a deployed security product or service, the vendor/provider can also identify more potential insecurity problems that exist for a particular group of users only and find ways to serve them better. 

We also expect that the software framework developed will help organisations' policy makers and IT managers to get more information about behaviours of their employee's and human attackers targeting their organisations, and the usability-security trade-off of their security systems (deployed and those under consideration for purchase), which will allow them to make more informed decisions on things like what security systems to use, how to use them, what security policies should be enforced, and if any training or educational programmes are needed for their staff and customers. We understand policy makers and IT managers will have more interests in macro human behaviours and more systems beyond human user authentication, so they can be potential users of the planned extensions of our research in future.

Like most IT systems, there are two types of end users of security products and services: 1) non-security service providers using such products and services developed by other companies to serve their customers (e.g., banks); 2) end human users who are actually using the products and services. In addition to indirectly benefiting from the software framework we will develop, both groups of end users can actually use the software framework to conduct independent evaluation of security products and services they use, which can help increase transparency of the security industry and eventually benefit security industry by giving more credits to better products and services. This may also foster a new service on independent security and usability evaluation of IT systems (e.g., like what Virus Bulletin Ltd is currently doing on anti-malware products). We will exploit the possible commercialisation of the software framework developed towards this direction.

As can be expected, our proposed research on human behaviours at the HCI level will create new knowledge on how human users and attackers behave and interact with computer systems. Such knowledge is not only useful for researchers, but equally so for practitioners and end users. This is particularly important for security education and training purposes, e.g., in designing and implementing cyber security awareness campaigns for the general public. The focused cyber security systems, human user authentication systems, are also a very good use case here as passwords are widely used in security education and training.

It deserves mentioning that the human and HCI modelling parts of our software framework are independent of security, so can be used for evaluating usability of any IT systems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>208099</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Genetics Institute</gtr:department><gtr:description>Consortium for project ACCEPT</gtr:description><gtr:id>4A60AB46-C2B6-4A21-8C2A-7C29F1A6AB17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project is to start, so no outcomes yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c412e2284c12.61050759-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Other partners helped form the consortium by bringing their expertise into the project proposal.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The University of Surrey led the formation of the consortium and won a research bid for EPSRC's Human Dimensions of Cyber Security call, which led to the project ACCEPT to start in April 2017.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Data61, CISRO, Australia</gtr:description><gtr:id>D68138BA-0DFE-4E15-831A-4075E3F74853</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Some data collected from a new user authentication system and a report on an enhanced timing attack are produced and sahred with all members of the COMMANDO-HUMANS project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c3ff469ca012.45120646-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Two researchers and some interns from CISRO have contributed to this project by conrtributing to all WPs, attending meetings to discuss research plan and to provide data on a new user authentication system for timing attack analysis.

The new technology has been named Pass8 (PassInfinity) and a patent application has been filed by the University of Surrey (using its own tech transfer funding). A prototype of Pass8 has been produced and some external funding has been secured from DCMS and Innovate UK through the SETsquared Partnership's Cyber Security ICURe (Innovation to Commercialisation of University Research) Programme for market research. Pass8 can bring new angles to the planned research in the project (as user authentication systems can now be designed in a very different and much more complicated way), but itself has the potential to create very high potential non-academic impacts as it can be used very widely by organisations and users to save costs and increase security of user devices and organisational networks. Pass8 can help policy makers as well because it supports much more flexible and agile policies on user authentication. Pass8 has been publicised by the University of Surrey and has generated great interests from the general public including BBC World Serivice. Since the technology just started creating impacts, it has not been actually used yet.

The main line of research in the project is still in its early stage of developing the software framework so at this moment no non-academic impacts are expected.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>30A29FD8-6DED-44AB-9183-8D62FFF6353B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58b43ab6682bb7.26912820</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>This is a patent applicaiton filed by the University of Surrey to protect Pass8 (PassInfinity), a new user authentication technology developed in the context of the COMMANDO-HUMANS project as a byproduct.

We also discovered many parameters that we did not previously know that should be incorporated in our software framework.

We found out that descriptions of user interfaces of some user authentication systems (and wider cyber security systems) require algorithmic parts rather than just static descriptions, which led to a new way of describing the user interface by having both static descriptions and interpreted computer programs.

We discovered eye-tracking is a useful technology to identify better ways to model human behaviours at the human-computer interface level, and has proved this through a use case on Undercover, which also led to a resesarch paper accepted to a conference (not published yet so will not be added to the publications until next year). The eye-tracking element was added to the software framework as a new component previously we did not include.

Based on the original plan and the above new discoveries, we have designed a more complicated software framework for modelling and simulating human behaviours in user authentication systems at the human-computer interface level. The framework is still being developed, and some components have been done or partly done. Part of the components have been tested using an example user authentication system called Undercover.

In addition to the design and development of the software framework, we also clarified human behaviour data we need to support the modeling tasks. Particularly, we identified a major gap in existing cognitive modelling tools: visual search. We have designed an experiment to conduct some user studies to get raw data we need to build human behaviour templates of visual search for the software framework.

Finally, the PI was also supported to work on another password related research which led to a conference paper accepted (not published yet so will not be added until next year).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The software framework we developed will help both researchers and practitioners who are using cognitive modelling tools such as CogTool to do more automated analysis with less efforts. While our software framework will be tested more on user authentication systems, most components we are developing will be universal for general modelling of user interfaces on computers. We expect our software tools (named CogTool+) will be able to attract all users of CogTool and other similar software tools. Since our tools will allow automated detection of some human behaviour related security problems, designers of user authentication systems and wider cyber security systems will find them useful. Our study on visual search in cognitive modelling will help psychologists and computer scientists to understand how human users behave to visual tasks on graphical user interface, thus gaining more insights on how to design such interfaces better. Our work can also clearly benefit cyber security education since it will provide new insights on complicated attacks caused by insecure human behaviours. We envisage our work will benefit many different sectors since user authentication and cyber security systems are used everywhere nowadays.

The research on humn cognitive modelling in cyber security has inspired the PI to improve other research work and start new research activities, which include an accepted paper on password visualisation and several new research projects on passwords and human-assisted data loss prevention.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>34049534-1B07-465D-8CFB-8B05A00F367B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b43687608ab0.01628578</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.commando-humans.net/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>It is an extended tool based on CogTool (https://github.com/cogtool) supporting meta-modelling and automated simulation of a large number of models of the same meta-model.
