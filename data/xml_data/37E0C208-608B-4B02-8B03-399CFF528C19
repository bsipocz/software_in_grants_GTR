Explaining cultural variation in psychological traits</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J01916X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Until recently, psychologists assumed that people from different societies all think in the same way as we do in the West. However, when psychologists started testing non-Western people, they found intriguing cultural differences. For example, when viewing scenes, Westerners tend to focus on single objects, whereas non-Westerners on the relationships between objects; socially, Westerners explain others people?s behaviour in terms of fixed personality traits, whereas non-Westerners explain actions in terms of social contexts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of this project is to explain how and why these cultural differences in thinking styles emerged and are maintained. We will take advantage of a unique natural experiment: immigration. If the UK-born children of non-Western immigrants resemble their parents psychologically, we can infer that those traits are transmitted from parents either genetically or culturally. However, if they resemble local non-immigrants, then non-parental influence must be at work. We will then see whether this shift is associated with specific factors, such as years of schooling, exposure to mass media, or bilingualism.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Questionnaires and behavioural measures will be administered to multiple generations of migrants, firstly targeted in the East London British Bangladeshi community, and then world-wide via an innovative web app.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The major beneficiaries of this research will be immigrants, particularly in and around East London, and the institutions that rely on the successful integration of immigrants (e.g. schools, local government, businesses). The project will improve social and economic integration of diverse immigrant communities by identifying the various factors that enhance or hinder psychological integration into UK society.

The successful social and economic integration of immigrants is a major and ongoing challenge for the United Kingdom. Every year since 2004 around 600,000 people have moved to the UK, and approx. 80% of these are non-British citizens (Office for National Statistics: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/). London receives a disproportionately high proportion of immigrants: non-White people make up 12.5% of the population of England, 30.3% of the population of London, and 42.9% of the London borough of Tower Hamlets where this study will be based (ibid). Immigrants contribute significantly to the UK economy: the last (2007) Home Office report estimates that migrants contributed around 15-20% of economic growth between 2001-2006, and &amp;pound;6 billion in 2006 alone. 

Yet integration is far from optimal: immigrant communities tend to be poorer and suffer higher crime rates than other areas. Immigration comes with huge potential security risks if integration is unsuccessful, either through criminal or terrorist acts committed by alienated members of immigrant communities (e.g. the 7/7 bombings) or by extreme right groups/individuals who perceive a lack of integration due to immigration (e.g. the 2011 attacks in Oslo, Norway). Immigration also places strains on the educational system as teachers must deal with pupils' increasing cultural and linguistic diversity.

The psychological variation that is the topic of this proposal plays a crucial role in this integration. A non-Western immigrant who has grown up in a collectivist society with large and informal social support network may find it difficult to adapt to a more individualist UK society. A non-Western immigrant who has previously relied on trust in economic exchanges may be exploited in equivalent interactions in the UK. A child who is used to formal rote learning in the classroom may fail to cope with the autonomy encouraged in UK schools.

In seeking to identify the proximate and ultimate factors responsible for maintaining and generating these psychological differences, this project can inform efforts in the public and third sector to foster the successful integration of immigrants in London and across the UK.

For example, if immigrant parents are found to transmit psychological traits to their UK-born children, then efforts should be targeted at parents to provide them with skills to better acculturate their children. If parents have little influence (as indeed suggested by pilot data) then targeting parents is a waste of money and resources. If the mass media has an influence then messages should be targeted to immigrant and non-immigrant media. If education is important then the focus should be on schools. Each of these is a potential route of transmission, but which actually matters when it comes to successful integration is currently unknown, and will be addressed here.

We will disseminate our findings to schools, local immigrant associations and charities to help them improve integration directly. This issue is also of wide public interest and importance given the potential social disruption caused by the perceived lack of integration of immigrants into wider society. To counter any misconceptions, we will disseminate our findings to the general public via media press releases, a website and a public event.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>369436</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Exeter</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Medical School</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Miriam Koschate-Reis and Mark Levine</gtr:description><gtr:id>8AA8D118-2EFD-45CF-BADB-0C6A1A743350</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Soon to be submitted publication</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b8d0166d1ad0.13578261-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Re-analysis of our dataset, preparation of a publication.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Miriam Koschate-Reis and Mark Levine of University of Exeter Department of Psychology re-analysed our British Bangladeshi dataset resulting from this grant, resulting in a collaboration on a publication to be submitted shortly.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Edinburgh mini-symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>75DFFD99-4BD4-4781-B951-40D0F79C8C43</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alex Mesoudi and Kesson Magid gave talks at a mini-symposium held between Durham University and Edinburgh University researchers interested in cultural evolution.

The grant has three primary objectives, and below I review their progress:

1. To administer questionnaires to multiple generations of British Bangladeshis in East London, as well as non-migrant members of the East London community, mapping cultural and generational variation in psychological measures. These include analytic vs holistic categorisation style, independence vs interdependence of self, global vs local perspective taking, and individualist vs collectivist values. 

Progress: This work has been published in the journal PLOS ONE. We found that, on those measures where 1st generation British Bangladeshi respondents differed from non-migrants, 2nd generation British Bangladeshis were intermediate between the two former groups. This indicates that thinking styles are flexible and can shift in just one generation due to acculturation. The paper received much media attention (see outputs) and has been viewed 1800 times in just one month according to the PLOS ONE website.

2. To create an app version of the questionnaires used in (1) to map psychological styles worldwide, and specifically in immigrant populations.

Progress: The app has been collecting data over the last few months. We anticipate around 500 responses in total by the end of the data collection phase. We have also targeted the Polish migrant community in the UK. The app was translated into Polish, and we used contacts in Poland (see Collaborations section) to obtain data from several hundred Polish respondents in both Poland and the UK. Data analysis will commence within the next month.

3. Lab experiments simulating the emergence of culturally variable psychological traits, in response to such factors as collaboration vs competition and environmental change vs stability.

Progress: All experiments have been completed and data is being analysed. Preliminary results show that there is no effect of our manipulations on thinking style.

Other outcomes:
The Research Assistant employed during the first year of the grant, Dr Delwar Hussein, left early to take up a postdoctoral position at Edinburgh University. We did not replace him during the three months remaining on his position because the postdoc on the grant could effectively finish data collection in his place.

We created a new website, www.thinkingstylesproject.com, which presents our research aims and findings in an accessible manner to the general public. This website has had 446 unique visitors since Nov 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our project has potential relevance for immigration debates and policy. Our provisional finding that second generation British Bangladeshi immigrants substantially acculturate to local thinking styles in just one generation suggests that fears over a lack of immigrant integration may often be unfounded, and that expensive programmes to facilitate integration may even be unnecessary. On the other hand, such rapid acculturation raises concerns over the loss of cultural identity in certain groups, as traditional strengths (e.g. a strong sense of family and community identification) may be lost.

Academically, our findings suggest that thinking styles are susceptible to rapid cultural change due to migration, rather than being genetically fixed. We will also open up new avenues for testing the origin of cultural variation in psychological traits through online apps and lab experiments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>33EFA144-8150-4DDB-8056-86B95BAB0797</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f9fe7b961a3.55721912</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.thinkingstylesproject.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Data from 330 residents of East London, made up of three groups: 1st generation British Bangladeshis, 2nd generation British Bangladeshis, and non-migrants living in the same area.
