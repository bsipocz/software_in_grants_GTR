It will outline issues of best practice in terms of engagement between government and a wide range of users in the realm of declassification. The themes covered will include Freedom of Information regimes, web publication of documents for public access, selection of documents for preservation, reviewing of proposed memoirs by former officials, official histories, government assistance to projects of cultural production and press liaison. In the original specification for our ongoing project, &amp;quot;Landscapes of Secrecy&amp;quot;, which is now in its final year, we explained that since 1947, American so-called 'secret' espionage and covert operations have in fact enjoyed a uniquely high profile. This is partly because of Washington's taste for 'covert' interventions that were in practice impossible to keep hidden from public view (for example the Bay of Pigs fiasco). The legal implications of the First Amendment of the US Constitution also assured journalists almost complete immunity when breaking stories about the intelligence community. Accordingly, over fifty years, the American polity struggled to balance openness and secrecy. Declassification of information relating to security and intelligence matters is an especially challenging area for policy-makers. Across Europe, new legal frameworks for intelligence and security that arrived in the 1990s have placed a stronger duty on government in terms of both accountability and public understanding. There is constant public pressure for declassification of historical records relating to the intelligence and security agencies. Yet at the same time, the growing burden of security issues, especially transnational threats, has placed a greater premium on state secrecy. The nature of the output from our current project privileges academic and public understanding. For example, the main output will take the form of four monographs dealing with, respectively: (i) declassification, (ii) memoirs, (iii) faction and (iv) the media. Public understanding has been prioritised through web-activity and a large conference which is designed to attract public participation as well as academic activity. Wider audiences are also being addressed through press articles and pod-casting. We now wish to develop specific &amp;quot;lessons learned&amp;quot; activity directed at government in the UK and Europe, together with the Third Sector. In the proposed follow-on project this will be realised through six different types of substantive activity (see 'Objectives' above). The proposed follow-on-funding project contributes to broad AHRC and RCUK priorities in four ways: 1. It explores 'pathways to impact' by training new researchers on case studies of practitioner engagement. 2. It draws out the lessons of the past to explore issues of transparency and trust in public life. 3. Through its partners and collaborators in Geneva and The Hague it engages with our European neighbours in government. 4. Most importantly, it contributes to evidence based policy-making for departments delivering security in the context of global uncertainty. (Arts &amp;amp; Humanities Research Council Delivery Plan 2011-2015, pp.8, 11, 14.) NB: Our application does not relate to impact activities that were already discussed within the original award. Please also note that we are aware that research on intelligence and security agencies, even in a historical context, can sometimes raise ethical issues. Both this proposal and the main project are focused on declassification and public engagement precisely because these issues are 'unsecret' and therefore relatively inert. Partly for this reason we have received enthusiastic support and offers of collaboration from the agencies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33246</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:department>National Intelligence Services</gtr:department><gtr:description>Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE5F0842-81A3-4156-9112-87CAFD698DF5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academic conferences with DCAF to distil policy advice - [multidisciplinary: history, american studies, film. literature, IR]

Informing security and intelligence practitioners
The 'Landscapes' team led by Aldrich has worked nationally and internationally to secure maximum impact of research findings among key security and intelligence personnel. A series of bespoke workshops were held in the UK followed up with policy briefs for the Ministry of Defence (15 December 2011); Cabinet Office (23 February 2012); Defence Advisory-Notice Committee (6 February 2012); Industry and Parliament Trust (1 February 2012); Serious Organised Crime Agency (18 February 2013); and Space Geodesy Centre (20 January 2012). 

Each workshop, attended by at least 20 people, was tailored to the specific needs of the end-user. The DA-Committee, the body that gives guidance on national security to the media, wanted to know how the CIA deals with the press. The Committee noted that it faced similar challenges to the CIA and resolved to initiate more cross-national dialogue. SOCA requested advice on how it should combat negative press portrayals of policing, and resolved to consider the team's suggestion of an official history. With SOCA being subsumed within the new National Crime Agency (NCA) in October 2013, an official history was regarded as a useful mechanism for institutional memory, and a valuable tool for knowledge transfer to the new agency. 

To explore European policy-transfer, two workshops on 'PR and Secret Services' were held with the Netherlands Foreign Office and the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies on 29/29 June 2012. Here, the user was struck by the team's discussion of how the internet represented a rich harvest of 'open source' material. As a result of this, Aldrich has been invited to join the Netherlands accreditation organisation (NVAO) with the purpose of developing a new multi-language training course in intelligence for the Dutch Staff College. Aldrich played a key role in alerting intelligence officers to the value of the internet for intelligence work. Workshops have also been held with the CIA and with the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF). DCAF have commissioned the team to produce &amp;quot;Toolkit 10&amp;quot; which will incorporate our findings into their security reform handbook Overseeing Intelligence Services: A Toolkit. 
Since 2012 Aldrich has been involved in the initial design of a new component of government within the UK. We include evidence of this at (5.5), but request that it be regarded as confidential. 

Shaping public policy debates about declassification
In November 2010, Aldrich succeeded Lord Hennessy as one of two academic advisers serving on the Cabinet Office Consultative Group on Security and Intelligence Records. The group, which meets at six-month intervals, considers requests by researchers for the declassification of official material, and is thus a vital mechanism through which scholars can lobby government. Aldrich has secured further releases on the financial control of intelligence (e.g. TNA CAB 301) He has also advised on patterns for future releases and the impact of the shift to a twenty-year rule in the UK. Moreover, he has used his research on CIA record management to alert UK government departments to declassification developments in the US. This has helped officials in London to better understand where UK release policy sits in a global context. Specifically, he has informed GCHQ about releases on joint UK-US operations by the National Security Agency (NSA). Since September 2012, Aldrich has also served as an adviser on a consultative committee designed to frame new security mechanisms within the UK in the context of possible constitutional change. 

Enhancing public awareness of and attitudes towards secrecy
The team has shaped international public understanding of intelligence, security, and secrecy. The project mounted the largest ever conference on the CIA, held at the East Midlands Conference Centre. All nineteen panels and plenaries were recorded by Backdoor Broadcasting and the conference, including the post-panel discussions, can be 'attended' for free via a dedicated web-site. According to statistics provided by Backdoor Broadcasting Company, this website has received 4.75 million 'hits' since its launch in May 2011. The number of downloads from the website stands at 36,690 (July 2013). The intelligence resources pages at Warwick created by Aldrich and Moran have received over 200,000 visitors since X. 

In the service of public engagement and the enhancement of cultural understandings of espionage, between 2011-12 Moran served as principal historical consultant to the International Spy Museum in Washington DC, working on the exhibition 'Exquisitely Evil: 50 Years of James Bond Villains'. The Museum's chartered responsibility is to inform the public about the fact, not fiction, of espionage. Moran's research was instrumental in convincing the Museum that spy fiction should be taken seriously, since it provides the public with a unique, if not necessarily accurate, window onto clandestine security relations. Moran's idea that public perceptions about intelligence are disproportionately influenced by fictive ideas derived from popular culture is the overriding message of the exhibition. On the basis of his research, Moran devised the intellectual framework of the exhibition; selected artefacts from the Bond film archive; and wrote many of the sidebars. During launch week, he gave media interviews (Fox News, Reuters, France 24, WUSA), and spoke at a reception to mark the opening, held at the British Ambassador's Residence in Georgetown. The exhibition has been widely reviewed in the American media, and has increased attendance at the Museum by 14%. 

To improve public understanding of secrecy, the team has produced a number of influential cultural artefacts. For example, Aldrich and Moran's research led to two 30-minute BBC Radio 4 documentaries for 'Document'. One explored a fracture in Anglo-US intelligence and the second revealed that Britain's greatest post-war secret, the existence of GCHQ, was nearly blown by an inebriated journalist in 1951; the latter was reported by the Telegraph and featured on the BBC homepage. Aldrich's research on the alleged traitor, Lord Sempill, was also the subject of an hour-long BBC 2 documentary, which featured Aldrich extensively. Finally, on 10 June 2013 Aldrich informed media debate about data sharing between the US National Security Agency and the UK's GCHQ via a live interview with Jeremy Paxman on BBC2's flagship programme Newsnight, which attracted 708,000 viewers http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02xd16y.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>91DF8ADD-BB86-45A8-B68E-11960F371A84</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd593eaa88c6.13173860</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Taken together, these projects have produced significant research findings, which can be summarised as six core conclusions and recommendations:
1. Secrecy is often counter-productive, causing more problems than it solves. By failing to communicate to the public, the activities of intelligence services can be misunderstood; worse, conspiracy theories harden and become accepted as &amp;quot;fact&amp;quot;. 
2. The new intelligence eco-system of the twenty-first century requires public confidence to function. During the Cold War, intelligence belonged to specialist high-level government agencies working mostly against a foreign enemy. This landscape has changed. Concerns about resilience and the arrival of 'Contest' (the UK counter-terrorism strategy) mean that intelligence is owned more broadly, including local government, private corporations such as airlines and banks, even individual citizens who are now expected to report suspicious behaviour. This requires new levels of public confidence. 
3. The vacuum that is left by secret services failing to communicate to the public is filled by journalists, historians and popular culture, including Hollywood. This is often disadvantageous, since outsiders, working with limited information, and sometimes with axes to grind, often produce sensationalised versions of events. 
4. By contrast, well-informed journalism and contemporary history offers an important adjunct to the accountability offered by political committees and the judiciary. While government has been reluctant to offer journalists a recognised place in the audit trail, the reality is that - working with whistle-blowers - they are the shock troops of accountability.
5. Recognising that it is problematic for secret services to leave their narratives to private hands, they should proactively engage with museums and other forms of cultural production. Official histories, especially when carried out by independent academics with full access, represent a valuable mechanism for enhancing openness. 
6. Social networking, whistle-blowing and new media heralds a more transparent society and a significant decline in state secrecy. Government, and especially secret government, is ill-prepared for this.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is important that a wider public debate is encouraged through mass media and social media.
