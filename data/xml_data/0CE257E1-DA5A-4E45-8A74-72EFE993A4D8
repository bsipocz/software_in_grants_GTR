It is the &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; which is processed by our computers and transmitted over the Internet. Every day we enjoy its benefits, since acquiring information means increasing our knowledge. For this reason, storing information is also very important. This is a process which is very common in our routine lives; for instance, think of a hard disk working in the background, or a DVD burned as a back-up of your most important data.

Advances in data storage could be much greater if they came from a deeper understanding of the concept of information. The basic unit of information, the bit, relies on our ability to distinguish between two states of a physical system. At the quantum level, storing and retrieving a bit of information relies on the capacity to discriminate between two quantum states of the system, e.g., spin up or spin down of an electron.

In our proposal, we consider a more advanced approach where information is encoded using quantum channels, i.e., the most general physical maps between quantum states. In our model, an encoder randomly picks a quantum channel from a pre-established ensemble, labeled by a classical variable. This channel is then stored in a black box and passed to a decoder. To identify the channel and retrieve the value of the variable, the decoder uses a transmitter, for feeding an input state into the box, and a receiver, for measuring the possible output states. Thus, data is stored in an ensemble of quantum channels and retrieved by the process of quantum channel discrimination.

Motivated by this approach, our first aim is to solve the general problem of quantum channel discrimination, by considering ensembles of Gaussian channels and assuming decoders with limited energy. This is an open problem, whose optimal solution will provide the core for a general theory on Gaussian channel discrimination.

This theory will then be applied to practical scenarios which are important for data storage. We will consider the quantum reading of digital memories, where the use of faint quantum light is remarkably efficient in retrieving data from classical optical discs (resembling CDs and DVDs). Our aim is to optimize this model by including error correcting codes and, most importantly, to make it practical by studying all the details of its optical implementation, where the inevitable presence of diffraction causes effects of inter-bit interference. Thanks to this study, we will be able to promote this theoretical idea to the level of a technological prototype, ready to be experimentally implemented.

The field implementation of a quantum reader could be a breakthrough in data storage, since we could increase data transfer rates and storage capacities of our digital memories by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, thanks to the non-invasive nature of the quantum light, new photo-degradable materials could be used by the industry for the construction of new types of organic memories. Our approach is high-risk but it could open the way to radically new forms of information technologies.

Then, a generalization of quantum reading is quantum pattern recognition. Here we aim to prove how quantum correlations can dramatically improve the performances of pattern matching in supervised and unsupervised algorithms (for instance, for data clustering). Quantum pattern recognition can potentially lead to a dramatic boost in the classification of raw data with minimal use of energy, negligible error rates and fast acquisition times. This technique could be used for the probing of very fragile biological or human samples in order to recognize the presence of bacterial growths or cancerous cells. Thanks to its non-invasive nature, quantum light could also be used for a continuous real-time probing of such samples. Results could be revolutionary in the long-term, providing completely new techniques for biological analysis and medical imaging.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential non-academic beneficiaries of this research can be divided in three main groups:

1) Society (Computers, Networks, Hospitals)

Today, quality of life is based on how fast and reliably computers are able to manipulate information, and data storage represents an important step in this process: faster and greater capacity memories are indeed necessary for realizing faster and more powerful computers and communication networks. Quantum reading is an effort in this direction: some of the most fundamental resources in nature (quantum correlations) are exploited to greatly improve the performances of an important information task, as the readout of data from digital memories.

An evolution of quantum reading is quantum pattern recognition, which aims to identify data with the minimal use of energy. A remarkable future application could be the probing of very fragile biological systems or human samples in order to recognize hidden patterns, e.g., bacterial growths or cancerous cells. Specific patterns of concentration could easily be spotted by using non-invasive quantum light, whereas classical light would just be useless or would destroy the samples. Thanks to its non-invasive nature, quantum light could also be used for a continuous real-time probing of these fragile samples. Such applications could provide important future techniques of medical imaging for private and public hospitals, with consequent benefit for the welfare of our society.

Note that the potential use of quantum mechanics to improve medical devices is currently a very hot topic in the US and Canada. Mike Lazaridis (inventor of the BlackBerry smartphone) has just opened the &amp;quot;Mike &amp;amp; Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre&amp;quot; in Waterloo (Ontario) financing the effort with a $100 million donation. The development of noninvasive medical-testing equipment based on quantum technology will be the main focus of the fund (for more details see the article: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/blackberry-inventor-starts-fund-to-make-star-trek-device-reality.html).

Impact is long-term (10-30 years).

2) Economy (Industry, Defence)

Our research on quantum reading could generate radically new forms of data storage and information technology with a long-term impact on the UK economy in terms of new companies and wealth creation. Potentially, we could speed up the readout of optical digital memories (e.g., DVDs and Blu-Rays) by orders of magnitude, as well as dramatically increase their storage capacities. New materials could be exploited for constructing organic memories, thanks to the non-invasive nature of the quantum light employed by these future devices.

Quantum pattern recognition could dramatically boost the classification of unknown data, with no error and ultrafast acquisition times. Confidential data could be encoded in patterns which are recognizable only by specifically-designed sources of quantum light. Applications are therefore for our Defence and private companies working in security and cryptography.

Impact is long-term (10-30 years).

3) Knowledge (General Public, Schools)

The general public is very interested in how science could have a revolutionary impact on technology. Therefore, connecting a difficult fundamental field, as quantum physics, to practical information tasks, such as the readout of optical discs, will foster increased interest by the public for basic science and research in general.

The specific outcomes of the present project and the physical principles behind it could be used as an educational tool by high-school teachers to promote student interest in basic science. Middle-schools students could also be interested in such applications of quantum information and consider a future career in this basic science on the basis of its technological impact.

Impact is short-term (1-3 years).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98019</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Communications of the ACM</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>47E559C8-F38C-4493-9990-190279B256F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog: Communications of the ACM</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d19ad16d7ed2.80256983</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://cacm.acm.org/news/183923-new-research-signals-big-future-for-quantum-radar/fulltext</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UCL</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F9C8D3A-9A2C-4D11-823D-B9D7CE4214B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College of London (9 Dec 2014)

This is important for the quantum readout of classical data since it will help an experimentalist to design the most appropriate sources of quantum-correlated light. We have also proven a formula to compute the fidelity between two arbitrary Gaussian states. By using this formula, one can extend quantum metrology and quantum hypothesis testing to completely arbitrary Gaussian sources of quantum light, with unexplored implications for these areas of quantum information.

We have clarified the role of quantum discord in quantum channel discrimination, showing that quantum discord is the fundamental resource consumed in the protocol of quantum illumination, which regards the practical tasks of sensing the presence or not of a target object in a noisy far region. Most importantly, we have extended quantum illumination to microwave wavelengths by employing suitably electro-opto-mechanical frequency converters. The error probability of this microwave quantum-illumination system, or quantum radar, is shown to be superior to that of any classical microwave radar of equal transmitted energy. Our system is suited to such potential applications as standoff sensing of low-reflectivity objects, and environmental scanning of electrical circuits. Thanks to its enhanced sensitivity, our system could be employed in low-flux non-invasive techniques for protein spectroscopy and biomedical imaging. 

We have then proven that thermal sources of light with suitable correlations can be engineered in such a way to approach, or even surpass, the error scaling of coherent states in the presence of general Gaussian decoherence. Our findings pave the way for practical quantum metrology with thermal sources in optical instruments (e.g., photometers) or at different wavelengths (e.g., x-ray regime) where the generation of quantum features, such as coherence, number states, squeezing or entanglement, may be challenging.

We have studied the ultimate rates (capacities) which are achievable in the quantum reading of classical memories, proving their super-additive feature. This means that a parallel quantum access of a classical memory where the cells are read simultaneously (which can also be seen as a type of quantum pattern recognition) provides a non-trivial advantage with respect to a sequential data access, where the cells are independently read one after the other, even by the use of quantum probes.

We have shown that quantum channel discrimination can be applied to various physical scenarios, including the discrimination of quantum field theories, e.g., in the context of the Unruh effect. Together with the previous study on quantum illumination, this work has contributed to extend quantum channel discrimination well beyond the basic discrimination of lossy channels.

Finally, the application of our methods has also generated other results in other areas. For instance, we have also clarified the role of quantum discord as a primitive in quantum cryptography. Quantum discord can be associated with the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) in the absence of entanglement. This also explains the recent successes in the field of measurement-device-independent QKD, for which we have designed a new protocol able to reach very high rates, suitable for the construction of a secure quantum network at the metropolitan scale.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our current findings can be exploited in several ways:

1) We have shown that quantum channel discrimination can successfully be applied to many physical scenarios, from tasks such as enhanced target detection (quantum illumination) and optimized data readout (quantum reading) to extreme applications like the discrimination and validation of different quantum field theories.

2) We have completely clarified the nature of quantum correlations in Gaussian states which are the most important quantum states in quantum information and quantum optics with continuous variable systems. These correlations can now be easily quantified and exploited in many protocols of quantum technology.

3) We have also completely clarified the similarity between arbitrary Gaussian states. By using our formula for the quantum fidelity, one can extend the study of quantum teleportation, cloning, quantum metrology and hypothesis testing well beyond the standard case of two-mode Gaussian states to consider multimode Gaussian resources, with unexplored implications for all these basic quantum information protocols.

4) We have shown that it is possible to extend protocols of quantum sensing and quantum metrology from the optical regime to other more challenging regimes, such as the microwave or x-ray frequencies. This studies may lead to the design of novel and completely non-invasive biomedical techniques.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ECA20BA1-0073-4015-9A18-F982E8139FF8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5448dc8dd99ab9.45415517</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and
