Green supply chain integration and its performance implication</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J016799/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>In recent years firms are under pressure to reduce environmental impacts of their global supply chains. Customers in many developed countries intend to accuse or boycott firms lacking environmental responsibility if their developing-country supply chain partners are convicted of causing environmental damage. This has triggered the needs for suppliers and customers to coordinate environmental management practices.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research proposes a novel concept for environmental collaboration among suppliers and customers. The new concept, called ?green supply chain integration?, involves the strategic collaboration of partner firms in a supply chain to manage the operational and environmental impacts of supply chain activities by coordinating the intra- and inter-organisational processes. This concept extends the concept of environmental collaboration by integrating environmental management systems across a supply chain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research is anticipated to identify effective practices of green supply chain integration that can simultaneously improve operational and environmental performance of firms from developing and developed countries. It contributes to the understanding of policy issues and helps to reframe debates surrounding the adverse effects of the environmental regulation differences between developed and developing countries. The outcomes of this research help to advance knowledge on environmental collaboration and sustainability within the business and management discipline.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research helps firms in the UK, HK/China and Thailand to create and improve action plans for coordinating environmental management to achieving sustainable environmental and operational performance, leading to less pollution and adverse environmental impact and therefore improving the quality of life of the involved communities. To achieve this impact, the project website will continuously inform and update interested parties, including business managers and policy makers, with key findings of the research via Electronic news (e-news). Wider audience will be reached via regional and national newspapers. Next, several practitioner-friendly papers and industry benchmarking reports will be made available for downloading. These publications and benchmarking reports provide key findings of the research including best practices, lessons learnt, operating models, implementation key success factors and implementation frameworks. The research will publish a practitioner article at the CIPS's Supply Management Magazine. E-news will alert the availability of such publications. The website is open to any interested businesses to download the various papers and reports. Downloading frequency will be traced and reported to measure the extent of the dissemination. The proposed interview, survey and case study will be used to engage with businesses. Each survey respondent will receive a personalized industrial benchmarking report. Two case studies are planned to further explain the survey findings as well as allowing the investigators and case companies to co-develop practical frameworks and action plans to coordinate environmental management. Selected case companies will be asked to share the success and experience with other by giving keynote speeches at the industrial seminar. Relevant businesses, industrial associations, regulatory bodies, academic researchers and management consultants will be invited to participate in the one-day industrial seminars. Copies of policy and industrial benchmarking reports will be distributed to the relevant participants. The industrial seminar allows the investigators and invited case companies to explain the key findings and recommendations to the participants. A break-out discussion session during industrial seminar will allow participants to engage with each other, share best practices, and create opportunity for future collaboration. Management consultants will be able to translate the findings of this research into consultancy frameworks to benefit wider business communities. This research informs policy makers the effects of current environmental policies in encouraging firms from developed and developing countries to jointly reduce environmental impacts of their supply chain. Policy-focus papers based on the survey and case study findings produced by the PIs will be made available for downloading. The policy report provides scientifically rigour analyses to prove its effectiveness of the various ways environmental policies affecting buying firms in communicating, monitoring and collaborating with their suppliers. Relevant policy makers will be invited to participate in the industrial seminar. The purpose of such is to spur further debates and policy improvement. A break-out discussion session during industrial seminar will allow policy makers to discuss policy implications with the related industries. Policy makers from developed and developing countries may take the findings of the research as a basis for harmonizing relevant policies. The business and management research community will benefit from the novel theory of green supply chain integration (GSCI) developed by this research. The research will disseminate the findings of this research mainly through three major conferences - EurOMA, POMS, AOM and three journals - JOM, DSJ/IJOPM and AMJ.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>70593</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Working Seminar: Integrating environmental management into the supply chain</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3AEAC1B-F2EC-4C87-A121-CB1CD5556500</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The working seminar on &amp;quot;integrating environmental management into the supply chain&amp;quot; delivered by Professor Chee Wong and Dr. Sakun Boon-itt to about 25 practitioners at Thammasat Business School.

Eleven presentations have been delivered at academic seminars or workshops in Thailand (2012), Essex (2013), Leeds (2013), Austria (2014) and York (2015), the European Operations Management Association EurOMA Conference(2012, 2013, 2014, 2015), British Academy of Management (BAM) conference (2013), and the Logistics Research Network (LRN) conference (2013). Over one hundred academic researchers who specialize in supply chain management or corporate social responsibilities from all over the world attended the presentations. These events resulted in two new research grants:
? A research grant awarded by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University for investigating sustainable supply chains from a suppliers' perspective;
? A research grant awarded by The Technology Strategy Board (TSB) for a new Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project.

The academic presentations also helps created a new collaboration between the UK PI and another researcher from Spain and as a result they published two papers (Tachizawa and Wong, 2015) which extend the idea of GSCI to beyond first-tier suppliers (Journal of Supply Chain Management, 2015 and Supply Chain Management: an International Journal, 2014).

Six academic journal articles have been published. A conference paper presented in 2015 (EurOMA) has been invited to submit to the Journal of Supply Chain Management. A further journal article has been submitted to International Journal of Operations &amp;amp; Production Management (under review, 2015). Two further journal papers planned to be submitted to Journal of Operations Management and Production &amp;amp; Operations Management. These articles contribute to the academic literature in the following manners:
? Develop new theory and conceptualization of green supply chain integration (GSCI) for further advancement of green supply chain management literature;
? Demonstrating how green supply chain integration may collectively help firms to become lean, green and profitable, advancing the theory on lean and green to include profitability;
? Provide detail case examples how some firms managed to apply green supply chain integration to achieve lean, green and profitability. 

Economical and policy:
The research is expected to help companies gaining environmental, cost and financial benefits after successfully implemented green supply chain integration practices. The project team has been invited to speak at various practitioner conferences. A panel discussion on supply chain collaboration was delivered at the Supply Fest at London (June 2014) to more than 80 supply chain executives and practitioners and another panel discussion for the same conference in September 2015 has been arranged. Another keynote workshop &amp;quot;Integrating environmental sustainability into the supply chains: How does it work?&amp;quot; was delivered at the Integrated Supply Chain Event in London (October 2013) to about 20 supply chain executives. A practitioner magazine article is being drafted for submission to one of the supply chain practitioner magazines and a report which benchmarks GSCI practices will be published and sent to hundreds of companies that participated in the research. The project team is currently following up with some of the participants who have expressed interests in adopting the GSCI practices. 

Societal:
The research is expected to indirectly contribute to better quality of life once more companies implemented some of the GSCI practices and realized environmental benefits in terms of the reduction in emission and pollution and the use of raw materials. It is expected to help reducing impacts of commercial activities on the environment. More importantly, this research has made especially hundreds of companies that participated in the research from both developed and developing countries on how they could effective integrate environmental goals and best practices in their supply chains including their suppliers and customers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>75975B82-A604-4200-A40C-D2C651230316</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cfd950ad507.01533558</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research shows that some companies in developed and developing countries have implemented integrated green supply chain management practices called green supply chain integration (GSCI). It shows that companies have started to create an integrated management system that guides the implementation of company strategy and top management behaviour towards a better balance between financial and environmental goals (green internal integration). This is a very crucial first step before companies can effectively communicate and collaborate with suppliers, customers and community stakeholders. It shows that some companies have started to work with community stakeholders such as local governments, NGOs and even competitors to coordinate their efforts in greening the global supply chains (green stakeholder integration). Such multi-stakeholder initiatives become effective especially when they are supported by major buyers and United Nations. We also found out that, collaboration with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders rely not only on creating new trust and better relationship. It depends on the exchange information and integration of environmental management processes across the supply chains (green supplier, customer and stakeholder integration). 

More importantly, this research shows that it is possible to achieve better competitive performance in environment, cost and finance by implementing all the green supply chain integration (GSCI) practices. This finding is encouraging because it means it is possible to be lean, green and profitable. However, the research shows that companies cannot focus on just one of the four GSCI practices - such companies will not achieve cost and financial benefits. Some GSCI practices are more effective in improving environmental performance (green internal and supplier integration) other are more effective in improving cost and financial performance (green supplier and customer integration). The research shows that companies that have successfully implemented all four GSCI practices (green internal, supplier, customer and stakeholder integration) also performed well in environmental, cost and financial performance over their competitors.

The empirically validated measurement of GSCI provides managerial insights to practitioners on how they may develop GSCI by adopting the various practices to establish green internal integration, green supplier integration, green customer integration, and green stakeholder integration to improve performance. The validated measurement of GSCI also lays ground for future research GSCI by providing a measure for future studies to examine issues such as the antecedents of GSCI, the organizational structure and business environmental conditions under which GSCI is effective in improving performance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings can be taken forward or put to use by other researchers - they can apply the theoretical conceptualization of the green supply chain integration and its empirical evidence to further advance theories related to environmental supply chain management in a complex supply chain. Other researchers should consider adopting a multiple dimensional measure of each type of green supply chain integration in order to examine the real extent of the novel green supply chain management concepts.

The findings can be taken forward or put to use by practitioners (supply chain managers) - especially for those firms that have responded to the survey, they can use the list of green supply chain management practices to first diagnose their practices and benchmark their practices with other survey respondents. The research shows supply chain managers the combinations of green supply chain integration practices that help to achieve lean, green and profitability. They can then learn from the findings of this research to identify effectives ways to improve both operations and environmental performance through applying the green supply chain integration approaches identified by this research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4204C63F-F0C0-4EEE-A317-60684A9417A6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f9f4107a529.92153546</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.greensupplychains.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F46E349C-7F0A-41CD-85DA-80994B51164A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Research challenges in municipal solid waste logistics management.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Waste management (New York, N.Y.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3fef6f894a0fb65a2f13101aaab3ac6a"><gtr:id>3fef6f894a0fb65a2f13101aaab3ac6a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bing X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0956-053X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d39c7d718e3.54312848</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E5C15958-3783-4395-970A-9B04A3AF0A7B</gtr:id><gtr:title>How Does Sustainable Development of Supply Chains Make Firms Lean, Green and Profitable?
