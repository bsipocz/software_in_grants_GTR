To designate a product as authentic can be a politically, economically and culturally charged process involving multiple levels of meaning. Authenticity can be an official legal status; it can be used as a cynical marketing ploy; it can reflect a sense of cultural belonging; it can constitute a defence of particular production practices. Such ideas of authenticity are fundamentally constructed through narratives about the past and future, and employ various temporal concepts used to join together distinct pasts, presents and futures. Producing or consuming a product deemed authentic offers a means of enacting or performing values associated with particular interpretations of the past or visions for the future. In this sense, authenticity can be a central ingredient in the celebration, commemoration or valorisation of different identities, cultures, histories and socio-economic practices. However, it can also marginalise, exclude, exploit or damage others. Consuming Authenticities will examine how and why narratives about the past and future are used to construct ideas about the authenticity of specific cultural products. The project will reflect closely on the power relationships-across socio-economic, racial, gender and/or generational lines-that are involved in prioritising, selecting and excluding different temporal narratives from these ideas of authenticity.

These questions will be addressed through four case studies on foods and drinks that are, or have been, emblematic of particular identities and cultures around the world: pulque (an alcoholic drink from Central Mexico), acaraj&amp;eacute; (a street snack from Brazil), flaounes (celebration Easter pies from Cyprus) and Welsh cider. Exploring relatively everyday items of cultural consumption from multi-national contexts will enabe us to incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences into the research process and explore how ideas about authenticity are received by audiences from different cultural backgrounds. A range of non-HE collaborators, including food writers, cooks, producers, retailers, and migrant community groups, will be invited to contribute their own impressions about the authenticities of each product during participatory events; in turn, their views will be integrated into the project's central output, a recipe-style book. 

This project will examine how and why temporal concepts that are routinely mobilised to connect together understandings of the past, experiences of the present, and visions for the future -like origins, timelessness and tradition- are used to construct authenticity in different contexts. We will also assess the relationship between these temporal categories and the spatial, or place-based, concepts that contribute to constructions of authenticity, such as locality, homeland and metropolis. By bringing together temporal and place-based concerns, the project seeks to develop the CFF theme by providing a methodological model for analysing other temporal concepts (e.g. progress, legacy) and how other cultural products and experiences (e.g. heritage sites) are constructed as authentic.

The project draws on academic expertise from several disciplines, including history, post-colonial literature, linguistics and anthropology, and explores four cases that range across two centuries and two continents. This academic team will work closely with the People's Collection Wales, a project partner with extensive experience of public engagement, to engage food producers, promoters, consumer groups and the general public. We will therefore embed knowledge exchange in the research process, so that cross-disciplinary and cross-period insights inform the different case studies, and a genuine dialogue can occur between academics and non-HEI stakeholders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
This research has the potential to benefit a wide range of non-academic stakeholders, who will be actively engaged in the research process and in the communication of its results. A key institution from the public sector, the People's Collection Wales, will be the main project partner, collaborating in our main events and in the production of a central output, the recipe book. Additional collaborators will be recruited from the business and industry sector, including craft cider producers in the UK, food writers and cooks. In the longer term, we will seek to engage producers of pulque and acaraj&amp;eacute; through our main outputs and dissemination strategy, but the international logistics of involving them directly in the exploratory stages of the project would be unfeasible. Beyond these two sectors, our research will also directly involve groups from the general public, especially migrant communities from Mexico, Brazil and Cyprus, and devotees of cider festivals, whose narrative accounts of each product under examination will also be sought through the project's research process.

How might they benefit?
The principle impact the project aims to have for these three groups of stakeholders is the development of cultural awareness and knowledge regarding several key strands of our research. Working collaboratively with the People's Collection Wales will contribute to its mission to safeguard the cultural memory of Wales and to spread interest in Welsh history and culture, particularly by focusing on foods and drinks as products deeply connected with everyday material life, identity and cultural expression. By bringing together analysis of Welsh cultural produce and the role of history in the construction of its authenticity, with case studies from around the world, the project will facilitate cross-cultural exchange of experience and knowledge. Similarly, the project will document aspects of past and contemporary Cypriot, Mexican and Brazilian culture, benfiting the respective communities. Producers, food writers and cooks will also benefit from the research in cultural terms, as the project will help to improve their awareness of the complexity of relationships - temporal, spatial, and material - involved in the culinary sphere. For a diverse section of the general public, the project will help to generate greater awareness of how historical knowledge and acts of consumption can support meaningful, respectful and inclusive cultural dialogue, or, conversely, can exclude, disrespect or marginalise other cultural perspectives.

The business and industry sector could also benefit in commercial and economic terms from the research. Our project will raise public consciousness about particular products, their histories, and cultural significance, with the potential effect of improving their commercial performance. While the project intends to evaluate the negative, as well as the positive, consequences of selectivity in the construction of authenticity, and, ultimately, to show that authenticity is a constructed and contested category, it is nevertheless likely that our discussions of these cultural products will render them more visible, interesting and desirable to new public consumers. Similarly, there is a potential environmental impact for business and industry stakeholders and the general public. As our research seeks to unite temporal perspectives with the more spatial, or place-based, concerns of other research on cultural authenticity, the project could increase awareness of sustainability issues in relation to food production and consumption. Our analysis of the ways in which each product's historical significance, origins and traditional status are depicted to construct ideas about authenticity will draw attention to broader processes of change in the production, transport and consumption of these, and other, foods and drinks, and thus contribute to wider environmental debates about sustainability.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>46583</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Library of Wales</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Consuming Authenticities Project Partner</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B85BDF6-2CF8-4BA0-AC2E-FA0F42C9E87B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Recipe book; Digital collection on PCW website; Blog; Collaborator's Workshop; Book Launch</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d829f81b9237.69020231-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The principle contribution the PCW made in kind was in the form of staff time and expertise, particularly that of Hazel Thomas and Gryffudd Jones.

We produced a general audience book, Authentic Recipes from Around the World, which was co-written with 3 non-academic authors (Hazel Thomas, Elaine Forde and Rocio Carvajal). Further contributions to the book were made by cider producers, museum professionals, chefs, food writers, home cooks, street vendors, and consumer organisations (eg Welsh Cider and Perry Society), which were solicited through organised events, interviews and fieldwork. Many of these contributors were named in the publication, while others preferred to remain anonymous. 

The project also directly supported the establishment of a new digital collection, Assembling Welsh Cider, on the People's Collection Wales website, which will continue to be developed by the People's Collection team in the future. 

Part of the project's research (on pulque) will inform a special feature in Hot Rum Cow magazine (to be published in April 2016), which draws on the Authentic Recipes book as well as an interview with Deborah Toner. Our project blog has also engaged some cider producers in reflecting on challenges and opportunities that the idea of authenticity provides for their products.

Preliminary feedback gathered on the collaboration process and on the impact of the general audience book suggests the project has increased interest in the culinary traditions and practices surrounding pulque, acaraje, flaounes, and Welsh craft cider. For instance, some attendees at our book launch indicated the event and book stimulated their desire to go to a cider festival, to visit Brazil (the home of acaraje) and Mexico (the home of pulque), and try new foods in general. In addition, this feedback suggests our work has advanced public understanding of the contested nature of &amp;quot;authenticity&amp;quot; as a cultural construct and the role of historical narratives and temporal categories in this process. For instance, some attendees at the book launch reported the event and book had made them reconsider more critically the relationship between food and cultural, national and ethnic identities, and would make them look at recipes, cooking and their own family traditions in different ways. Others highlighted the positive impact of being able to network with other producers and interest groups at our events, and indicated they would model events of their own on what we did.

We are still engaged in disseminating the Authentic Recipes book and the project's research findings, and assessing the impact and reach of the book and the Assembling Welsh Cider digital collection - both in terms of how the existing cultural and societal impacts have developed, and whether any new economic/commercial impacts may develop over time. This will be ongoing for the next couple of years.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EBA86B18-9DAD-4226-BB35-2736840735DB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bcb6cf86cec9.15190739</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project explored authenticity in relation to foods and drinks from different parts of the world: pulque (an alcoholic drink from central Mexico), flaounes (celebration Easter pies from Cyprus), Welsh craft cider, and acaraj&amp;eacute; (a street snack from Brazil). We wanted to foster increased awareness about the complexity of cultural and historical relationships involved in the culinary sphere and in defining authenticity, by bringing together people and perspectives from food cultures around the world. 
Our key findings included the following:
In all four of our case studies, the people involved in producing the food or drink are central to how its authenticity is defined. This is perhaps unsurprising, especially when producers themselves reflect on why their product is or is not authentic. But there is considerable variation in how the person's characteristics contribute to the product's authenticity: skill, knowledge, length of experience, pride, passion, family relationships, links to the locality or neighbourhood, appearance, racial, ethnic or national identity.

The importance of place to a food or drink's authenticity is often intertwined with a sense of that place's historical significance and can be very politically charged. In this sense, people's different views on where acaraj&amp;eacute; can be consumed &amp;quot;authentically&amp;quot; reveal much about the legacy of Brazil's colonial past, while flaounes are invoked in reconciliatory politics aimed at healing past divisions between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.

There is often no straightforward relationship between authenticity and the time involved in producing the food and drink. The slow labour of love in the making of both pulque and cider are valorised, but the very short time in which pulque is viable and pleasant to drink is also seen as part of its enigma, while dexterity and swiftness in certain stages of making acaraj&amp;eacute; and flaounes demonstrates their producers' skill and knowledge. 

&amp;quot;Tradition&amp;quot; is as complicated, multidimensional and difficult to define as authenticity itself, but key to whether or not claims to authenticity are accepted. Tradition might be family-based and thus lead to many subtle variations in the way a food or drink is prepared, while making it no less authentic. Tradition might be rooted in the method of production, avoiding the use of modern tools and techniques. Tradition might be firmly or loosely tied to a specific origin point in the past, a myth or an interpretation of history. It might refer to all of these things simultaneously, or entirely different forms of tradition.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our approach to analysing authenticity - from multiple disciplinary perspectives, with non-HEI collaborators, and in a diverse case study model - could be used to critically examine how other temporal categories and relationships join together past, present and future.
Secondly, authenticity has been widely explored within the field of food studies, but the temporal dimensions of how certain foods are constructed as authentic are not common themes.The scholarly focus has generally been on the role of place and spatial relationships in constructing culinary authenticity; our project's focus on temporal dimensions, and their relationship to spatial ones, could be taken up by others.
Thirdly, our analysis of authenticity could be used to analyse a much broader range of cultural products and experiences, including heritage sites, music, clothing, and craft objects.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>825C6F59-D824-43B1-ACE9-5D2583BB6C1A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bca441dcfc31.07437023</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://staffblogs.le.ac.uk/consumingauthenticities/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>283D716A-92E9-43A3-9DBE-FD2EA991979C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Consuming Authenticities: Time, Place and the Past in the Construction of &amp;quot;Authentic&amp;quot; Foods and Drinks (Panel)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b07cc903e4658c65ce807a2f44506880"><gtr:id>b07cc903e4658c65ce807a2f44506880</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Toner D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b97bc19b33a3.05807182</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D8706CD4-4249-40BE-BB1D-3998A4F95671</gtr:id><gtr:title>Origins, Traditions and Authenticities: Pulque and Indigeneity in Mexican History and Heritage</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b07cc903e4658c65ce807a2f44506880"><gtr:id>b07cc903e4658c65ce807a2f44506880</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Toner D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b97df525c198.59573332</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6C8A60D-9D0C-45F7-8081-E02E19DC260F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Alcohol and Authenticity (Panel)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b07cc903e4658c65ce807a2f44506880"><gtr:id>b07cc903e4658c65ce807a2f44506880</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Toner D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b97e74d98f37.98905579</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>60744037-C1D2-40E6-8794-573E682425BC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Authentic Recipes from Around the World</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a27fbe5d0ee0cfb908ae0ecdf8433de0"><gtr:id>a27fbe5d0ee0cfb908ae0ecdf8433de0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Toner, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780956255396</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56bc922d8bd2a3.64192264</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M006018/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8990E5FE-B44F-4A5B-8FDE-0610A5BE98C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C451D81-4626-46D5-BE5B-7B684CED97EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies &amp; Pop Culture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2606D7FE-3D1B-4A58-B497-DB1B211EFF02</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociolinguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
