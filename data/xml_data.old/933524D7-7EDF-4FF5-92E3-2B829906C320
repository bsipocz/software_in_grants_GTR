However the long-run implications of such innovations are poorly understood and unquantified. There is limited understanding of the behavioural characteristics of manufacturers and consumers needed to support successful innovation for sustainability. Consequently, the sustainability benefits of business model innovations often fall far short of expectations and can be counter-productive. This proposal seeks to advance the study of industrial sustainability by extending the application of agent-based modeling techniques to explore system-level implications of sustainable business models. The research will build an understanding of the impact of business models on the industrial system. It will identify key leverage points which will support industrialists and policymakers in facilitating greater triple-bottom-line sustainability. The project will produce guides for manufacturers and researchers to enable investigation and experimentation with alternative sustainable business model innovations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will contribute to the research areas of industrial sustainability and business models, and deliver the groundwork and a research framework for future academics and industry to build upon. This will strongly complement other EPSRC research centre themes around sustainability, engineering and manufacturing by providing an over-arching framework within which to explore sustainability innovations. The proposed technique of agent-based modeling of sustainable business models will provide a much-needed test-bed to explore the efficacy and long-run implications of new industrial configurations, identify opportunities for intervention to enhance sustainability outcomes, and better anticipate and address potential negative side-effects and the various forms of potential policy resistance. This will be significant for policymakers and industrialists seeking to meet the pressing need for transition to more sustainable and resilient industrial systems to respond to growing economic, environmental, and social challenges. This will have impact at the individual firm level and also at the national level by providing guidance on where to transform behaviour accordingly through appropriate policy intervention and leveraging new business models, investment and technology. Taking a world-lead in this field and stimulating early exploration and adoption of innovative new business model configurations will enhance the UK's industrial position as sustainability increasingly becomes a dominant driver of business resilience and competitive advantage. This will have impact for firms, investors, employees and stimulate overall national economic activity. By assisting in better aligning firms activities with broader system-level needs, it will also have significant positive impact on environmental, energy and resource issues, and contribute towards delivering the broader long-term well-being of society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>352523</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at 2degrees supply chain event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B5B843AA-4217-44C7-A64C-46BCF0B33E83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Steve Evans spoke at a 2degrees supply chain event in London on 6 March 2015 about his work in developing new business models that support durable and sharable benefits from the retailer/supplier relationship.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c8f1d5307f62.71246740</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop to identify new opportunities for Bangladesh SME Foundation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC46E1EE-02B8-44ED-9C8A-B8E8E83EF359</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A one-day workshop on Bangladesh's open innovation in the agri-tech catalyst for SMEs (SME Foundation) was hosted at the IfM, Cambridge on 23 September as part of a BBSRC Impact Acceleration Account funded project. Workshop participants included the General Manager of the SME Foundation, a non-profit company established by the Government of Bangladesh's Ministry of Industries to promote growth of Bangladesh SMEs, as well as the managing director of a Bangladeshi SME, the Commercial Counsellor from the Bangladesh High Commission, and the acting High Commissioner. They joined Centre Director and project Principal Investigator, Prof Steve Evans and Co-Investigator Dr Nazia Mintz-Habib, as well as several other Centre researchers. During the morning session the group used the Cambridge Value Mapping Tool to identify new value opportunities in the services provided by the SME Foundation from a stakeholder-network perspective. In the afternoon, the Service Analysis Tool was used to analysis the financial autonomy of the SME Foundation in Bangladesh from a policy making perspective.

The workshop provided participants with an in-depth exploration into the complex structure of the SME Foundation and its relationships with various stakeholders. Structured routes to engaging in more effective policy-making were identified to promote open-innovation by the SME Foundation in the Bangladeshi agri-tech industry. In total, 21 potential value opportunities were generated. Cambridge researchers benefited from the opportunity to assess the applicability of two existing tools in a policy-making context in a developing country. Anticipated future activities include a follow-on workshop in Bangladesh with an extended group of participants that fully represent the network of stakeholders to fully explore potential business model innovations using other Centre tools.

Abstract: Due to the increasing demands for integrating sustainability within business, manufacturing firms are paying more attention to improve their performance in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria. Several authors have hinted the importance of maintenance to achieve more sustainable performance but no comprehensive empirical study has been done yet. This research contributes to the understanding on how maintenance can support the achievement of more sustainable performance in manufacturing industry.

During the webinar attendees asked questions about the research presented to further understand the implications and potential for collaboration.

FA.VELA develops skills and capabilities of residents of low-income communities to enhance their opportunities for personal and professional growth. The project RESILIENTE accelerates both existing and new sustainable businesses from low-income entrepreneurs to enhance the urban resilience and restoration of the Pampulha Lake Basin in the municipalities of Belo Horizonte and Contagem (state of Minas Gerais). Due to the large number of industries and favelas in the basin, the project emphasises collaboration to the development of innovative solutions and frameworks for sustainable business models.

Steve and Paulo helped the project by designing and defining its scope, strategies and next phases; providing feedback about the materials and methodologies that will be used in the acceleration process; meeting with the sponsors, namely the Newton Fund from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and, together with a professor from Newcastle University (Jos&amp;eacute; Esteban Castro) and members of FA.VELA, they conducted the kick-off workshops. These workshops consisted of a seminar for a broader audience and 2 days of intensive work exclusively with low-income entrepreneurs to design their businesses and to find new opportunities for sustainable value.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5811f323ebddb3.34795915</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FlexMan Press Release by NiTech</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B753EF62-6884-430E-A012-57D0CB87DE05</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NiTech Press Release Titled: NITECH WINS MAJOR &amp;gt;&amp;pound;1m INDUSTRY-LED PROJECT

This understanding cannot be built solely from textbooks, papers and laboratories, but is strengthened and deepened by engaging with practice, exchanging with peers and broadening horizons of experience.
In order to support these needs the Centre developed the cohort programme, bringing together students of manufacturing, design and industry with a common interest in sustainability. The cohort development programme is there to support research students from across Centre institutions and from the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (DTC) in Sustainable Materials and Manufacturing, but we have welcomed members from across the UK and the international research community. 
Over the last 5 years, the programme has provided a range of opportunities for researchers to gather and engage in activities to improve their research practice, build networks and expand personal horizons. Events have ranged from research practice - helping understand the tool building process - to communication skills, practicing how to communicate research ideas succinctly to industry. The community has also exploited social media such as Facebook to maintain contact between events and share the latest news and conferences. The cornerstone of the programme is an annual retreat which brings students, researchers, senior academics together to develop shared understanding, and personal vision for their role in the future of manufacturing.

The tools have been used by over 200 companies and organisations (90 in 2016 alone) and proven to drive effective improvements in various dimensions of operation - cost avoidance, improved growth, new product and service development, strengthened relations with key stakeholders to name but 4.

Beneficiaries:
Engagements with over 90 businesses in 2016 some examples include:

Kingspan - Insulation Manufacturer
Croda - Chemical Manufacturer
Veolia - Waste Recycling company
Linde - Major Gas producer (was BOC)
M&amp;amp;S - International retailer with manufacturing supply chains
Altro - Industrial Flooring and walling manufacturer
iema - membership professional institute
Bangladesh Government

Outcomes:
Most companies will not allow their names to be associated with Business Model development activities as the outcomes can be strategically sensitive. Below are some examples of recent outcomes.

? Riversimple LLC : Disruptive transport SME obtained &amp;pound;15M in 4 round investor funding after revising business model and value proposition to funding community.
? Mid Cap PVC goods manufacturer: Avoided potentially high risk investment in new product line (&amp;pound;1M) and purchased rival manufacturer with better business model and market position
? International Chemical Company &amp;amp; SME with disruptive technology - devised new basis for licensing agreement - enable implementation of new technology 3 times faster than had been anticipated with associated cost benefits and market growth.
? Multinational Corporation Division: Enhance the value proposition and business model for a new product line and obtained 3x investment enabling faster market penetration
? Service SME: Transformed the business model and value propositions of each part of their services portfolio gained support for associated business transformation from Staff, Customers &amp;amp; Board. Turned around the decline in customer acquisition returned to growth within 6 months.
? UK Retailer: Created program to identify suitable new disruptive businesses to enable transformation ahead of market. Built new businesses with advanced business models - transforming elements of the business from product to service and established business cases to evaluate in line with existing decision parameters.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6CC5C406-B858-49FC-A561-08AC3413C357</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6db4ae3940.47000136</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research insights have been developed into a set of tools that can be configured to assist businesses, organisations and policy makers to investigate, analyse and develop current and new business models in order to create and capture new value.
