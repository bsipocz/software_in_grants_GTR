Perhaps the most well known example is the role they play in the famous Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Given an elliptic curve, for simplicity defined over the rational numbers, the conjecture relates various arithmetic invariants of the elliptic curve (such as the rank of the Mordell-Weil group, the size of the conjecturally finite Tate-Shafarevich group) in an astonishingly precise way to the value at s=1 of the L-function attached to the elliptic curve. This last one is defined by putting together local information, over all prime numbers, of the elliptic curve, and as defined makes sense only for the real part of s large enough (actually 3/2) and in order to make sense at s=1 one needs to establish its analytic continuation. This is now known thanks to the celebrated work of Andrew Wiles on the modularity of elliptic curves, and it is achieved by identifying the L-function of the elliptic curve with an L-function of a modular form. 

Actually the picture just described conjecturally extends to a much general situation. Namely to an arithmetic object, usually called a motive, one associates an L-function which it is believed to encode in its special L-values important information about the underlying motive (Bloch-Kato conjectures). However these L-functions, even though they are defined in the realm of arithmetic geometry, they can be studied with the current status of knowledge only by identifying them with the L-function of an automoprhic form. This connection between motivic and automorphic L-functions suggests that special values of automoprhic L-functions may enjoy interesting arithmetic properties. 

Indeed the main aim of this research project is to investigate algebraic and p-adic properties of special L-values of automorphic forms of various kinds, namely Hermitian, Siegel and Siegel-Jacobi modular forms. For Hermitian and Siegel modular forms we aim to the construction of abelian and non-abelian p-adic measures, which constitute an indispensable ingredient in the formulation of the Main Conjectures of Iwasawa Theory (commutative or not), which in turn is the only tool available to tackle the aforementioned relation implied by the Bloch-Kato conjecture between arithmetic invariants and special L-values. 

The situation is different with respect to the Siegel-Jacobi forms. Their L-function is not known at present to be identified to an L-function obtained from Galois representations, and actually they are not related to Shimura varieties. However they do enjoy arithmetic structure and in this research grant the aim is to address the question whether the various well-understood phenomena for automorphic forms associated to Shimura varieties (algebraicity of special L-values, Garrett's conjecture on Klingen-type Eisenstein series etc) are still valid for Siegel-Jacobi modular forms.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research may have an indirect impact to the economy in the following way. The mathematics involved in the proposed research has direct links to ``Cryptography'' and ``Error-Correcting Codes''. Both of these are well known for their enormous economic, and not only, impact. The proposed research is linked to Cryptography in a generic and rather negative way. Most of the Cryptographic Protocols used today (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol, RSA, etc) rely heavily on the belief that various number theoretic problems (such as factorization) are computationally hard. Even today this has not been proved, but it is only the fact that even after considerable augmentation of the knowledge in the area of Number Theory, still these problems remain computationally hard. In this way the suggested research, being in the area of Number Theory, contributes its part to strengthen this belief.

The impact of the proposed research arising from the connections to Error-Correcting Codes is of a positive nature. In the proposed research I intend to investigate arithmetic properties of Siegel-Jacobi Forms. Recently there has been a great interest in understanding the connections between the theory of Error-Correcting Codes and Jacobi Forms. Hence studying the arithmetic properties of Siegel-Jacobi forms could contribute to understand better the link with Error-Correcting Codes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96841</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop talk by Dr Marzec</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1DAEE681-378C-4AF9-8D90-89EC0B9C4A6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Marzec (PDRA) gave a talk in the 31st Automorphic Forms Workshop, in Johnson City (USA).

Siegel-Jacobi modular forms are the higher rank and index analogue of the classical Jacobi forms, which have been studied from various points of view in the past ( Eichler and Zagier, Shimura and others). Number theorist are interested in the special L-values of automorphic forms for many reasons, one of which, if not the most important, is the connection to motivic L-values through the Langlands philosophy. Siegel-Jacobi modular forms do not quite fit in this picture since as automorphic objects do not correspond to Shimura varieties, but to mixed Shimura varieties. Nevertheless, they seem to enjoy quite similar properties and in this first year of the grant the focus was to take this analogy as further as possible. In particular in a joint work under preparation with Dr Jolanta Marzec, the PDRA of the grant, titled &amp;quot;On the standard L-function attached to Siegel-Jacobi forms of higher index&amp;quot; we have managed to obtain the following results:

1) We have extended previous results of Arakawa and Murase on the analytic continuation of the standard L-function attached to a Siegel-Jacobi modular form. More specifically we generalised their work to any totally real field, arbitrary index, and we have considered congruence subgroups with level.

2) We have also obtained some first results towards the algebraicity of their special L-values. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this aspect of the L-values has been studied.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope that our systematic study of the analytic and arithmetic properties of the L-functions of Siegel-Jacobi forms will motivate other researchers working on automoprhic forms and connections to arithmetic to have a closer look to these automorphic objects. It is highly likely that also other important properties of (classical) automoprhic forms carry over to Siegel-Jacobi.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>02B0B446-DC85-4E20-8ED6-A41669007861</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2bee837a473.88100412</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N009266/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
