a number of properties that set them apart from normal cells. Understanding what makes a tumour cell different from a normal cell is important as it may allow us to identify new ways to selectively kill tumour cells. Tumour cells differ markedly from normal cells in the way they generate energy, being far more dependent upon the metabolism of glucose (a process known as glycolysis) than normal cells. We are interested in determining if this is an ?Achilles heel? by which we can attack tumour cells. If we disrupt glycolysis do tumour cells die? If so, how do they die? If not then, are they now more vulnerable to death in response to other drugs?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68776</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bath</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>AstraZeneca ERK</gtr:description><gtr:id>4AAAD679-80C4-4041-A67B-7AA06540990C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Much of this is still early stage.

For our partner (AstraZeneca/CRUK) this may allow development of rational strategies to overcome or delay resistance and thereby provide more durable drug responses.
