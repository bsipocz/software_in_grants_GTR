Both 'man on the street' communication styles and the deliberate breaking of the established linguistic registers of politics have been fundamental communication strategies for populists, as insults and verbal violence abound in this propaganda. Populists claim that they are saying 'what the people say and think', in order to be able to galvanise those who have lost faith in traditional politics. Since the mid-1990s, benefiting from an increase in favourable opportunities for them due to a series of internal and external developments (increasing migration for instance, or the 'War on Terror'), populists have gained their best ever results in some European countries and have entered national government in states such as Italy, Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands etc. Despite such dramatic developments, and notwithstanding innovative communication styles having been crucial to the success of these parties, the topics covered by this research remain noticeably under-studied.

As a consequence, it is only now that we can assess whether, once in government, these parties can go on deploying that radical and extreme rhetoric which has helped make them attractive to voters, or are rather 'forced' to moderate their language and become more similar to 'traditional' parties. This research will compare four populist parties in government in two Western European countries: the Lega Nord (LN) and Forza Italia (FI) in Italy; the Schweizerische Volkspartei/Union D&amp;eacute;mocratique du Centre (SVP/UDC) and the Lega dei Ticinesi (LDT) in Switzerland.

Such a comparison is particularly interesting since two of the four parties mentioned speak from within one of the founder members of the EU (Italy) while the other two are based in a profoundly euro-sceptic country (Switzerland) - and the power and role of the EU have indeed become major issues in populist propaganda. Furthermore, two of these parties (FI and the SVP/UDC) are nationalist and two (the LN and the LDT) regionalist. The project will answer the following specific questions:\nOnce populists have entered government (at either the national or subnational levels):\n1.

Does the 'tabloid-like' style of their publications, heavily reliant on strong visual presentations, dramatisation, personalisation etc. change and, if so, how? Moreover, do they still doggedly refuse to adhere to the conventional linguistic registers of political discourse or do they 'moderate' their language? \n3. How do they maintain their populist identity in their rhetoric and propaganda and how do they balance their necessary recourse to 'spectacular politics' with the responsibilities of office? \n\nApplication and benefit\nThe main potential applications of the study will be in teaching and research.

The main aim - of providing new comparative research on populist parties in a previously under-researched area (i.e. these parties' rhetoric and communication strategies) - was achieved through the completion of the outputs that had
originally been planned. The main applications of this study have been in research. Since this was an interdisciplinary project covering new ground, it has benefited academics, postgraduates and undergraduates in areas such as: Italian, Swiss and European studies, political communication, cultural studies and political science. The research has provided the basis for new collaboration with two scholars, one based at the University of Turin (Duncan McDonnell) and one at the University of Salford (James Newell).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3CBA57AC-213A-46F8-8A10-7A81AA0677D8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b61a635dbf0.48165385</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Following an established tradition populism is defined here as an ideology which pits a virtuous and homogenous 'people' against a self-serving, corrupt elite and a series of dangerous 'others' (immigrants, criminals, etc).

Aims and Objectives
The project has analysed populist propaganda (rhetoric, style, strategies of communications, use of party's own media) from a comparative perspective. Such a comparison is particularly interesting since two of the four parties mentioned
speak from within one of the founder members of the EU (Italy) while the other two are based in a profoundly euro-sceptic country (Switzerland) - and the power and role of the EU have indeed become major issues for populists. Furthermore,
two of these parties (FI and the SVP/UDC) are nationalist and two (the LN and the LDT) regionalist. The project has answered the following specific questions:
Once populists have entered government (at either the national or subnational levels):
1. Do their rhetoric and communication strategies change and, if so, how?
2. Does the 'tabloid-like' style of their publications, heavily reliant on strong visual presentations, dramatisation, personalisation etc. change and, if so, how? Moreover, do they still doggedly refuse to adhere to the conventional
linguistic registers of political discourse or do they 'moderate' their language?
3. How do they maintain their populist identity in their rhetoric and propaganda and how do they balance their necessary recourse to 'spectacular politics' with the responsibilities of office?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>More research is needed into how populist parties communicate and their use of the media (especially social media)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5947C439-C653-45B4-88B4-A91CFBF3797F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b642e7cc6b6.24194253</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D9215ECE-6BD6-4AB8-8246-33BBB814F6D4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Lega Nord Back in Government</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>West European Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/58483f5dd41cd9879c650c9d2bc6b4f6"><gtr:id>58483f5dd41cd9879c650c9d2bc6b4f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Albertazzi D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b69148d7805.59843543</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2999883D-73F5-4DD1-8FBC-98F1EB61815F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Di lotta e di governo: The Lega Nord and Rifondazione Comunista in office</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Party Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/58483f5dd41cd9879c650c9d2bc6b4f6"><gtr:id>58483f5dd41cd9879c650c9d2bc6b4f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Albertazzi D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b6a192536b2.43307365</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DE3BB8C0-688D-46CF-9025-7C2FE6A4223A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reconciling &amp;acirc;??Voice&amp;acirc;?? and &amp;acirc;??Exit&amp;acirc;??: Swiss and Italian Populists in Power</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/58483f5dd41cd9879c650c9d2bc6b4f6"><gtr:id>58483f5dd41cd9879c650c9d2bc6b4f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Albertazzi D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b672b6624a3.51017505</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A576A16-108A-4FAB-BE4D-41A873E5A559</gtr:id><gtr:title>La botte piena e il militante ubriaco: la Lega Nord al governo</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trasgressioni</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7723929e91ff51de5a0892eed6fcdac2"><gtr:id>7723929e91ff51de5a0892eed6fcdac2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Albertazzi, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b6832b39cf6.98977516</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF59D7DE-1459-4BF7-8FC3-F2FCA9276332</gtr:id><gtr:title>Addressing 'the People': A Comparative Study of the Lega Nord's and Lega dei Ticinesi's Political Rhetoric and Styles of Propaganda</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Modern Italy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/58483f5dd41cd9879c650c9d2bc6b4f6"><gtr:id>58483f5dd41cd9879c650c9d2bc6b4f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Albertazzi D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b6b4c7bac98.45302855</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F004680/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD9F0C26-AA57-4235-8010-AEBAF429C756</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
