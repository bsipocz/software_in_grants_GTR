Bubbl is a location based mobile technology built by ThinkInnovate Ltd that enables geofence triggered functionality managed from a web based dashboard, and activates extensive new location based geo-triggered app functionality through a simple app plug in for new or existing Android and iOS apps.

Bubbl's innovative state of the art platform and app plug in's are a perfect foundation for the new innovation proposed in this project, which will allow local knowledge to be shared via geofence triggered audio for authentic insight into the real character and passion of a location, taking the listener off the beaten track and into the heart of local stories and communities. 

The tourism industry struggles to adapt to new trends, and fails to answer the needs of the modern visitor wanting authentic experiences, but without extensive time spent on pre-planning or being stuck in a guidebook.

Traditional guidebooks rarely suggest areas outside of commercial hotspots and when they do, the content lacks the insight of those who know the area inside out. No marketplace exists yet where individuals, like local citizens or tourist professionals (working within a poorly paid sector) can monetise their knowledge on a scalable platform for the benefit of others.
 
Micro payments for the insights, stories and tours will be driven by market popularity, so anyone can become a tour guide and earn money depending on the quality of their insights or tour and it?s popularity with users. Such a marketplace with location-aware information for tourists is not yet available, showing high technical and commercial innovation. 

Bubbl works by triggering mobile based actions within geofence perimeters for any area, meaning that you can use it to engage visitors both in and around a venue or location. It has been built to initial pre-commercial prototype as a software that adds geofence triggering and 'functionality pack' capability to a brand or company app, with the ability to reach audiences in real-time, knowing exactly where they are, with specific targeted messages, and activity eg surveys, offers, e-commerce etc without breaching privacy. 

The technology does not require the user to open the app, but still triggers and delivers specific or multiple ?functionality pack? actions when geofence, proximity and other complex trigger conditions are met. It has been built to minimise battery and data drain when functionality 'packets' are in use.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">230038</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
