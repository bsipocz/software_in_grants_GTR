In these years, Japan moved from limited democracy and internationalism to militaristic nationalism and war, a shift which greatly affected education and experiences of childhood. Much has been written (mainly in Japanese) about how school curricula, textbooks, and ceremonies changed in order to inculcate children and adolescents with a strong spirit of loyalty to the Emperor and the Japanese state, and a willingness to sacrifice themselves. However, there has been little or no attempt to systematically record the memories of those who experienced this momentous period of Japanese history as children and adolescents. In addition, scholars have yet to make adequate use of the wealth of contemporary records of the personal experience of juveniles that survive from this period, especially in the form of diaries. As a result, it is hard to get a sense of what it was like to experience childhood, education, and youth in these years; moreover, scholars tend to make assumptions about the effects of nationalistic textbooks and school practices without supporting data. Also, the tendency to focus on the increasing nationalism and militarism of education during this period can lead us to overlook other aspects of the experience of childhood and education at the time. For example, what were relationships like between teachers and students, as well as between students themselves? What kind of teaching styles and methods did teachers use, and how did children experience these? What were children's lives like outside school, within their families and neighbourhoods, and with their friends? This research will investigate all these questions. The study is especially urgent because of the advanced age of those who were young before 1945.

The research will use two major methods. First, we will conduct oral history interviews with about 100 people who were children before 1945. These interviews will be recorded and summarized to create a digital archive to be held at the University of Manchester. Personal documents such as diaries, notebooks, letters and photographs will also be collected and copied for the archive. Secondly, archival research will use the rich and underexploited holdings in Japan of pre-1945 juvenile diaries. The research team will then write a history of the experience of childhood and education in Japan during the years from 1925 to 1945. In doing so, the team will also use recent studies of pre-1945 education by historians of Japan, which are often not yet incorporated into scholarship in English. 

The project is a study of memory as well as of history. Although many accurate memories of the past can be elicited by careful interviewing, it is necessary to scrutinize such memories for their accuracy by examining their internal consistency and by comparing them with surviving historical documents and records. It is also necessary to consider how memories may have been shaped by historical and ideological discourses about the past, something that is particularly important in the case of 1925-1945, whose history continues to generate controversy in Japan and East Asia. The project will endeavour to explain when, why and how memories conform to and diverge from familiar postwar narratives of the period. 

Impact beyond the academy will be enabled through a website with both English and Japanese versions, which will greatly interest educators and the public at large. Data such as transcripts of interviews (with English translations), personal documents, and photographs will be publically available through the website, subject to the permission of interviewees and donors. The website will be publicised to teacher associations, museums, and libraries. Given the study's relevance to citizenship and national identity debates, summaries of findings will be sent to government and NGOs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential benefits of this project extend well beyond the academy. Three main groups of beneficiaries can be identified. First, the research will benefit educators and educational institutions, including university lecturers, school teachers, textbook authors, and museums, by providing vivid recollections and analysis of the everyday lives of children during a key period in Japan's modern history. Leading educators are already enthusiastic about this. Japanese history museums, as well as those abroad interested in the social history of war, will take great interest in this unique archive. The project will give students at every level insight into the experience of childhood, education and youth in Japan at this time, and it will also help to bring this period to life for those at school and university, as well as the interested public. 

A second group of beneficiaries will be those involved in shaping educational policy in the U.K., Japan and elsewhere. This includes policy makers such as the Department for Education in Britain and the Ministry of Education and Science in Japan, as well as think tanks working on education (e.g. in Britain, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, Civitas, Demos, Policy Exchange, The Smith Institute) and other civil society groups. In recent years, questions about how to develop citizenship, foster a sense of national identity, and encourage children's patriotic identification with their country have been prominent in educational policy debate in different ways in many countries, the U.K. and Japan included. This research will throw such questions into sharper focus by illuminating the ways in which children were affected by nationalistic education in pre-1945 Japan, giving policymakers insights into the potential problems involved in education that focuses on national identity and patriotism, and informing public debate about these issues. The importance of such understanding can hardly be overestimated, given the powerful role that nationalist sentiment has often played in fuelling international conflict. 

Thirdly, the research will benefit those members of the general public who want to enrich their understanding of a crucial period of Japanese history. It can be expected to be of special benefit and interest to the Japanese public, given that this period remains highly controversial and the centre of historical and political debate. The British public will take interest as well, not only due to the interest in the history of childhood in general, but also the social experience of a nation at war. The recent successful exhibit at the Imperial War Museum, London, 'The Children's War', is an excellent example. 

The results of the research will be made available to these potential beneficiaries in a number of ways. Articles by the investigators will be available via the online institutional repository of the University of Manchester. Articles in the magazines History Today and Education about Asia will reach the interested public in the U.K. and U.S. The planned website is also crucial for dissemination of the research. The website will contain summaries of the research findings, suitable for 16+ and undergraduate students as well as the educated general public. As the website will have both English and Japanese versions, these summaries will be accessible in both languages. Transcripts and documents (with English translations) and sound recordings of the interviews will be directly available via the website when specific permission for this has been given by the interviewees, and the website will also explain how to access the digital archive. This will make the results of the research highly accessible internationally. Information about the website and archive will be sent to relevant teacher associations, museums and libraries in the U.K. Japan, and elsewhere. Non-academic briefings on the project findings will be sent to government departments and selected NGOs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>505740</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The product is a 28-minute DVD about the experiences of Japanese children evacuated from the elementary school attached to Tokyo Higher Women's Normal School (now Ochanomizu University) from 1944 to 1946.

The research reveals the importance of everyday experiences - ritual, imaginative, and physical - in developing in Japanese children during the 1925-1945 period a strong nationalistic and militarised identity centred on the Japanese Emperor. At the same time, oral history interviews and documentary evidence show how children could step back from nationalistic discourse through games, parody and irreverence in ways not previously appreciated. The research has also illuminated the relationships young people shared with each other, which has been neglected in almost all of the historical research.
? The research reveals the complex connection between pedagogy and nationalism during this period. While progressive pedagogy could be made to serve the purposes of nationalistic education, pre-war emphases on self-cultivation and 'free play' also endured. Conversely, wartime educational activities could encourage artistic development and scientific understanding while engaging in the patriotic war effort.
? The research shows how regional, gender, and class differences had a major effect on the life experiences of Japanese children and adolescents during this period, ranging from play, to access to media such as books and magazines, and educational opportunities. Studies to date have largely focused on the experiences of urban middle class children, a minority of the population. These children who enjoyed a relatively rich material culture of toys and media, and access to selective secondary education. Our research compares these experiences with those of the less well-off majority, especially in rural areas, whose play was dominated by homemade or inexpensive toys, and who had limited access to print media or post-elementary schooling. The research also reveals how post-war narratives of children's wartime experiences have been shaped by the perspectives of the middle-class minority, for whom war work was a deprivation, rather than the normality it represented for less well-off adolescents.
? The project has created an archive of oral history interviews about experiences of childhood and education before 1945, using interviews with almost 100 interviewees from across different parts of Japan, from Aomori in the north to Okinawa in the south. Each interview recording is accompanied by summaries in Japanese and English, and some interviews are accompanied by partial transcriptions of key passages. Initially a sample of interviews has been made publicly available, and the full archive will become publicly available with the completion of the new digital repository system of the University of Manchester Library in 2016. Depending on the wishes of the interviewees, interviews will either be publicly available without restriction, or else will require researchers to request password access. The completion of the new digital repository system will also enable the archive to make publicly available documentary materials digitized as part of the project, including diaries written by Japanese children in the final years of the Pacific War. We have identified a large number of further historical documents and images (diaries, hand-made toys, drawings, yearbooks, and arts and crafts projects by wartime children, together with post-war interviews and memoirs) in museums and archives across Japan, 300GB of which have been digitized for ongoing research by the team; permission to add at least some of these materials to the archive may also be sought.
? The project has created a bilingual (English and Japanese) website about childhood, education, and youth in Japan between 1925 and 1945. The website includes pages on 16 different topics, each with an introductory text, along with extracts from the oral history interviews. The website is designed primarily for use by students and teachers of this period of Japanese history, whether in secondary schools or universities, but is also a resource for the general public. As an Internet resource, it can be accessed worldwide, by all students and teachers with either English or Japanese language ability.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>? The research shows the complexity of childhood and education in Japan between 1925 and 1945, as well as the richness of the materials available for research on this subject. It will thus stimulate further in-depth research on a neglected topic. By providing a rare example of historical research materials and analysis on childhood and education in a non-Western society, it also enables international comparisons between non-Western and Western societies, which have been difficult and unusual to date. We hope it will contribute to overcoming tendencies to focus narrowly on Nazi Germany, and remind the public that the 'world war' was bigger than Europe.
? The digital archive created by the project will be an invaluable resource for scholars and students researching this crucial and controversial period of Japanese history. The archive makes an extensive collection of oral history and primary documentary material easily and globally available for the first time. As archival access becomes more restricted and some museums exhibiting histories of the war lose funding in Japan itself, preserving these materials has become a global priority. Besides the intrinsic value of our collection, it provides an example of the potential of digital humanities archiving, which may serve as an inspiration and model. Finally, the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two will be its most important remembrance event yet, as the wartime generation passes on and the post-war generations debate how it should be narrated; primary source materials like these accounts will be essential to those public discussions.
? The website created by the project will be valuable for teachers and students in secondary and tertiary education worldwide. Because it contains extracts from interview summaries as well as topic introductions, it can be used for student research projects addressing issues of history and memory. Because it is focused on Japan, we hope that it will allow teachers and students to develop a global perspective on World War Two and become part of established curricula in Europe.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C203B0BC-3563-44D2-B357-D7804025BED2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56db1a2759f473.12650619</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The project has created an archive of oral history interviews about experiences of childhood and education before 1945, using interviews with almost 100 interviewees from across different parts of Japan, from Aomori in the north to Okinawa in the south.

The completion of the new digital repository system will also enable the archive to make publicly available documentary materials digitized as part of the project, including diaries written by Japanese children in the final years of the Pacific War.</gtr:description><gtr:id>236CB853-32CA-4539-9C83-2E969538912D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There have been no impacts to this point (March 2016).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7b687e0ac2.53338796</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Japan Childhood History Archive</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/jrul/search/?search=%22Oral%20History%20Archive%20of%20Childhood%2C%20Education%2C%20and%20Youth%20in%20Pre-1945%20Japan%22</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C03C53CC-9D83-4B26-B49A-BFFF56946848</gtr:id><gtr:title>Story, song, and ceremony: shaping dispositions in Japanese elementary schools during Taisho and early Showa</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Japan Forum</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/405945131e1f4e1d06b10dfc899121b3"><gtr:id>405945131e1f4e1d06b10dfc899121b3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cave P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d36da90f5387.41543365</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C9618FFF-A18C-4783-B06D-69381201A779</gtr:id><gtr:title>Voices of Vulnerability and Resilience: Children and their Recollections in Post-Earthquake Tokyo</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Japanese Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a02127a5858dee9c8da395068da3de2f"><gtr:id>a02127a5858dee9c8da395068da3de2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Borland J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dc829b8ae370.35748199</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66A6C31D-A645-42BA-9CD5-C84602786011</gtr:id><gtr:title>Life in Retreat: Japan's Wartime School Evacuation in Practice</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Japanese Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/692a1946e3647f0ab71a21c008e98feb"><gtr:id>692a1946e3647f0ab71a21c008e98feb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Johnson G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bc832c01c652.15150697</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B47FE041-199D-4F11-A744-11A68B88E95E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Boy meets world: the worldview of
