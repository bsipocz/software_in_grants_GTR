These forty years saw intense scientific debates about the mechanisms underlying biological heredity as well as the establishment of mass compulsory education systems in both Britain and America. The convergence of these developments galvanised a new drive to establish the fundamentally innate and measureable nature of mental ability. The rise of intelligence testing and the associated concept of IQ was highly controversial, but it nonetheless achieved a considerable scientific and cultural legitimacy in both countries, and encouraged a tendency to conceptualise intelligence in statistical terms, as a phenomenon that distributes itself predictably around a norm in a population. 
 This project compares how British and American novelists used the bildungsroman form - the novel of education and personal development - to grapple with the implications of the new drive to render intelligence an objectively knowable phenomenon. What did it mean, and how did it feel, to be classified as being above, below, or of average intelligence, at a moment when such judgments began to lay claim to scientific authority? To what extent did novelists in the period endorse or contest the IQ model of intelligence, and what alternative ideas about the evaluation of intelligence can be discovered in the bildungsroman, a form with roots in Romantic theories of education? What is the relationship between new efforts to conceive of intelligence as a testable and unitary entity in the brain and the shift toward more experimental modes of literary representation in the late nineteenth- and early twentieth centuries? 
 The project will also enquire into how shifting ideas about the nature of mental ability affected the discourses of literary criticism and conceptions of authorial identity in the period of transition from the nineteenth-century realist novel to the experiments of modernism. What impact did the rise of the notion of IQ have upon modern ideas of talent, creativity, and aesthetic value? 
 Finally, the project will explore how literary culture in this period can both clarify and enrich our contemporary debates about competitive examinations, meritocracy, and genetic determinism.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Pl and Co-I will also hold a series of public lectures in Kent and London that will explore how novels illuminate the personal and social implications of the modern drive to evaluate intellectual ability. These lectures will draw upon our research but frame it in terms likely to engage an audience interested in questions of academic selection and its ongoing problems. This includes specifically targeted educational lobbies with whom the P-I and Co-I have links (Kent Education Network, Comprehensive Futures), educational charities such as The Access Project, representatives of the two main political parties, parents, school governors and teachers. These lectures will consider how novels from our chosen period clarify the stakes of current debates about inequality, genetic determinism, and the politics of education. The PI and Co-I will each write two lectures and deliver these in locations that have already been selected for their history of commitment to non-selective education: Highbury Grove School in Islington, Bennett Memorial School in Tunbridge Wells, Brompton Academy, and Herne Bay High. In addition, we will make the lectures available as podcasts using the University of Kent's media facilities, and seek to publish revised versions of the lectures in newspapers and magazines with wide circulations. The Co-I is already in discussions with Fiona Millar at The Guardian about these issues and will seek to write copy for the newspaper exploring the project and its implications. Although we anticipate that the lectures will be attended primarily by teachers, students, and parents in local communities, we expect the to have a very broad public appeal, since they seek to provide critical insights into a virtually universal experience - assessment in modern education - and will use novels to approach the slippery but politically crucial question of how we feel about the concept of intelligence.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>194862</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P004520/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6147F869-528E-4716-B75D-1EEFD77024B5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>American Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
