While nature reserves and farmland have many pollinator initiatives in place, urban areas do not despite supporting many pollinator species.

Why the work is important
Insects such as bumblebees, hoverflies and butterflies pollinate crops and wild flowers providing an important ecosystem service. Pollinator conservation is important for global food security and the value of pollination services by animals is estimated at &amp;pound;129bn per year [1]. Reported declines in insect pollinators have serious implications for food production [2]. Concern over pollinator declines is high on policy agendas; Defra will publish a National Pollinator Strategy in July 2014 and a Welsh Pollinators Action Plan was published in 2013. One of six core areas of Defra's Strategy specifically addresses pollinator-friendly management of towns, cities and public land. Our research shows that urban areas can support important pollinator communities, provide connecting habitat across the wider landscape and pollination services for urban food production [3,4]. Safeguarding biodiversity across the UK landscape is a key government priority [5,6] with planning authorities required to protect priority species, including pollinators, as well as minimise impacts on biodiversity and provide net gains where possible [7]. Pollinator services will be the first fast-track assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.

Context
The fellowship will build on research carried out during the 'Urban Pollinators: their Ecology and Conservation' project, funded by the Insect Pollinators Initiative (NERC, BBSRC, Defra, Scottish Government and The Wellcome Trust). I was the lead postdoctoral researcher and co-ordinated all aspects o the research (2011-14). The project studied pollinators in replicate cities, farms and nature reserves, sampled 700 sites in four cities to assess the suitability of urban habitats for pollinators and planted 60 pollen and nectar-rich flower meadows to examine their benefit for pollinators. The KE activities will draw more widely on other relevant urban research and the expertise of researchers in the eight other Insect Pollinators Initiative projects. I will also build on Lynn Dicks' NERC KE Fellowship (2011-14) by applying her Delivery Group approach to specifically address pollinator conservation in urban landscapes. Dicks' fellowship focused on pollinator conservation in rural and agricultural landscapes; the proposed fellowship specifically targets urban areas.

Fellowship KE programme
During this three-year fellowship I will apply KE processes to improve the management of UK urban areas for insect pollinators and promote the uptake of pollinator friendly management practices. Urban habitats are a complex mosaic of public and privately-owned land and six work packages will bring KE to a broad spectrum of stakeholders: i) incorporation of research findings into policy recommendations, ii) establishment of a stakeholders' Urban Pollinator Conservation Delivery Group to identify and address priority knowledge needs, iii) review, workshop and trials on road verge and amenity grassland management, iv) development of a pollinator lawn mix in collaboration with industry, v) promoting uptake of pollinator-friendly habitat management by private business via demonstration sites and vi) producing case studies on initiatives developed in Bristol to apply nationally.

This event involved international experts, policy makers, representatives from international bodies, and representatives from local, national and regional pollinator initiatives. Following presentations participants engaged in discussions about best practice around the world, examined the successes of local and regional initiatives in translating evidence into actions, exploring the routes to success, the key players involved, barriers to success and how these were overcome, and how other initiatives can achieve the same successes elsewhere. Follow-up activities will produce a roadmap for more effective action and collaboration to address pollinator declines and associated ecosystem restoration, food security and sustainable development.

Headings below follow the annual report template provided.

1. Activities, outcomes and impacts of the KE Fellowship

(i) Interactions with policymakers
I have attended quarterly meetings as a member of Defra's National Pollinator Strategy Steering group and provided input into Defra's National Pollinator Strategy Progress Report.

(ii) Partnership work in Bristol
I have continued to lead a partnership of eight local and national organisations which has relaunched the Greater Bristol Pollinator Strategy for 2016-2020. I have also led the publication of a report summarising partnership activities in Bristol in 2015 and 2016 which was published in March 2017 and shared with relevant stakeholders, including national policymakers. I organised two Steering Group meetings for the partnership and am liaising with Friends of the Earth who are promoting the development of local pollinator strategies and action plans throughout the UK, drawing on the Bristol work as an example.

(iii) Developing floral lawns for pollinators
Two additional experimental sites were planted in Spring 2016, one at Bristol Zoo and another at RHS Harlow Carr in Yorkshire. Both are located in areas accessible to the public and are accompanied by signboards which explain the aim of the experiment and the experimental design. In 2016 monitoring protocols were developed and tested at the first site located on University of Bristol land planted in 2015. All three sites will be monitored from late Spring to early Autumn in 2017. A workshop was held at the University of Bristol site in August 2016 and feedback was gathered from council and NGO practitioners which has been incorporated into the monitoring protocols. 

(iv) Partnership work with the Royal Horticultural Society
Following a trial survey to collect data on which pollinator-friendly plants are grown in UK gardens in 2015, we used the pilot data to revise the online survey questions. The full survey was launched in June 2016 and promoted at a national level. More than 1500 responses were received and we are currently analysing these data. The data will be used to inform the development of the RHS Perfect for Pollinators list which provides advice to gardeners on good plants to grow for pollinators and will guide future research.

(v) Presentations

September 2016 - presentation at annual Super-B meeting to share research findings and knowledge exchange activities with European researchers. Super-B is an EU COST Action related to pollinators and pollinator services.

July 2016 - presentation at International Pollinator Biology, Health and Policy Conference at Penn State University USA sharing research findings and knowledge exchange activities with international researchers and practitioners working in pollinator conservation.

(vi) Publications
See Researchfish publication section.

2. Number of new partnerships created (defined as involving an exchange of resources) Private, public, third sectors, as well as other universities. 

No new partnerships since last report - developing activities with current partners.

3. Other outcomes and measures of success - please report against those described in your proposal plus others that have become apparent.

None further to outcomes described above.

4. Impact Case Studies - please indicate any potential case studies and also state whether you need additional resources to produce these. If you have a good impact story we can send you a case study template.

The next step for the partnership work in Bristol will be to write up the approach as a case study. Any templates from NERC to guide case study development would be of benefit.

5. What will be the legacy of your KE Fellowship - external to your host organisation, internally in your organisation and personally.

(i) External to host organisation
- First local Pollinator Strategy in the UK, to be used as a template for other cities and regions.
- An improved and ultimately evidence-based &amp;quot;Plants for Pollinators&amp;quot; list for gardeners published by the Royal Horticultural Society.
- Increased knowledge on good plants to include in floral lawn mixes for pollinators, and which mowing regimes maximise floral resources in lawns.
- Evidence-based recommendations incorporated into advice provided by Defra as part of the National Pollinator Strategy.

(ii) Internally within organisation
- Development of impact related to Urban Pollinators Project research
- Activities and outputs that can form part of a future REF case study

(iii) Personally
- Expanded network of contacts beyond those at start of fellowship
- New collaborations with academic and non-academic partners
- Future grant opportunities based on KE Fellowship activities and outcomes

6. Please outline any future KE opportunities that you can identify below:

It would be good to link my fellowship activities and outcomes with broader green infrastructure projects and initiatives via the NERC KE network and other opportunities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>00F6E932-B8F7-47FD-9429-42334AD923E4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56dd51390ede30.96629526</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Defra National Pollinator Strategy Advisory Steering Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D8D704D9-3C63-4D35-935A-7E7F64337A35</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd356d192870.68932591</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>723BF843-CE04-4689-87B1-9434FD1ECFC3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Where is the UK's pollinator biodiversity?
