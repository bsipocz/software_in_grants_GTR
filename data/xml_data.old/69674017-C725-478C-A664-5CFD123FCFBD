A new type of optical based analsyer which will be able to differentiate between healthy fruit, and fruit with internal disorders such as rot or latent infection, will be developed. The proposed instrument will be easily integrated into existing packaging line systems and aims to provide early detection of infected or spoiled fruit, such that this fruit can be marketed early or discarded to prevent the spread of further infection. Overall, this type of quality control with result in a new method of crop management, increasing production efficiency and yields, and therefore benefiting the UK and worldwide markets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal will use a photonics-based approach for detection of volatile biomarkers for fruit quality monitoring, enabling appropriate action to be taken by producers to minimise losses. This includes (a) the early detection of latent fungal infection pre-harvest to enable earlier marketing of fruit to reduce losses in apples, cherries and plums and (b) post harvest detection of internal fungal rots and physiological disorders prior to packaging and marketing. This will be achieved by developing an integrated photonics based QA detection system which can be used in the packing line prior to storage, or after storage, to minimise economic losses. Furthermore, it may also prevent fruit with high concentration of mycotoxins infected by a Fusarium species from entering the food chain. Overall this non-invasive monitoring approach will result in a reduction of crop wastage, improved value for money in post-harvest treatments, reduction in grading cost after post-harvest storage and before marketing, reduction in environmental impacts and will maximise yield and profit.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will generate results that will contribute to:
(a) maximising marketable yield and profit potential. This proposal will develop an photonics-based solution for the early detection and quantification of latent fungal infection before post-harvest storage;
(b) reducing crop losses, hence increasing profits;
(c) improving value for money in post-harvest treatments;
(d) reducing grading cost after post-harvest storage before marketing;
(e) minimising potentially negative environmental impacts associated with food production;
(f) developing innovative engineering tools to optimise market value of UK perishable food chains;
(g) offer practical devices which can be utilised in packing lines and post-harvest prior to packaging for improved QA and reduction in losses.
The photonics-based system developed in this proposal may be applicable to other fruit and vegetables although further research is necessary to derive classification criteria based on volatile profiles.
The social benefits of this project also include the potential increase in quality of marketed fruit and even reduced cost to the consumer through greater efficiency in production, both of these benefits contributing to overall benefits to public health.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73281</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presented a talk on the UK strawberry production and research at the Chinese Strawberry Annual Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E0CE35C-3538-4F71-9DF7-D365B2B14C10</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented an invited talk on the UK strawberry commercial production and current research landscape. In the research landscape, the focus is on the oil-less substrate production, including the principle of using AMF and PGPR in substrate.
During the meeting, we discussed fruit volatile in relation to fruit quality with a German researcher.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd2224097742.45409327</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M005445/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>3024F703-51C1-4739-9933-80422C690032</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>BB/M005445/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>140422.42</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>69674017-C725-478C-A664-5CFD123FCFBD</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>BB/M005445/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>73281.2</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>15080F45-1EA3-41B4-BC23-C49CB918FBC4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
