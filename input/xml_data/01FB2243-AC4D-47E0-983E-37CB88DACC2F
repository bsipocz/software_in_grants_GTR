The Joint Water Evidence Group was established to enhance collaborative working on land and water issues across the Defra network to ensure the best use of resources and embrace innovative approaches to gathering evidence. Evidence Reviews search for, review and summarise the evidence available in response to a given question in order to communicate findings to end-users, making better use of existing research and ensuring that research has real impact The project will work to refine the guidance for ER methodology and practice, incorporating feedback and comments from end users and stakeholders, thereby improving the understanding of the science-policy interface. The Fellow will also work with policy and practice makers and other stakeholders in the water area to identify their objectives and evidence needs in order to develop the questions to be answered by ERs. The Fellow will be responsible for the project management of a number of ERs and will ensure a high standard of delivery. Through engagement with the Natural Environment Research Council and other Research Councils the Fellow will ensure that new and up to date research is fully incorporated into ERs, facilitating knowledge exchange. The project will also ensure effective and timely communication, in the appropriate format, to a wide range of stakeholders in order to maximise the benefits of the project to policy makers, businesses and practitioners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100939</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department For Environment, Food And Rural Affairs (DEFRA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Defra Flood and Water Cluster</gtr:description><gtr:id>7CDD092C-4058-40A2-87F9-6AF6D1B6B94E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Systematic Review of Environmental Needs to Support Water Abstraction Reform (EBPLW12044)

We will compare systematic review processes and results to three rapid review methods that differ from systematic reviews in terms of 1) search comprehensiveness, 2) data extraction, and 3) study quality assessment. During one or more of these systematic reviews, detailed data on time requirements for searching, screening, data extraction, and quality assessment will be collect, allowing us to identify the most time-intensive parts of the process. We will also implement alternative quality assessment approaches as applied in Eco Evidence and Rapid Evidence Assessment methods, in collaboration with colleagues in Australia (S. Nichols, A.

A number of tools such as protocols, checklists and forms were also developed to aid the efficient production of reviews. The How-to-Guide has been adopted as guidance for the production of Rapid Evidence Assessments and Quick Scoping Reviews for Defra, the Environment Agency and Natural England. It has been used to set details of contracts and guide specifications for several research and development projects ensuring that robust methodologies were followed and outputs produced were of high quality and helped to inform policy and practice decisions. 
During the last year there has been continued interest in the work which has led to the US EPA using the methodology guidance for a number of projects as well as it being used by the Scientific Advisory Mechanism of the European Commission.

The funding enabled a Fellow to work as a core member of the Joint Water Evidence Group (JWEG). JWEG work across Defra and its associated agencies to coordinate and collaborate on water and land research. This provided a deep understanding of the use of evidence to meet decision makers' needs, so that outputs produced were fit for purpose. 

The work of the fellowship enable methods to be develop to aid: 
?setting appropriate questions that will meet decision makers' needs
?unbiased searching and screening of evidence
?searching for evidence from a variety of sources, including software that can assist with this
?critically appraising the quality of evidence found
?quantitative and qualitative synthesis of evidence
?assessing and communicating uncertainty in an evidence base
?creating reports appropriate for decision makers, and
?reporting methods transparently</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The continued use of the How-to-Guide will lead to further improvement of methods to gather and synthesise evidence to meet decision maker's needs throughout Defra and other public bodies. This will result in further efficiencies and evidence-informed decisions being made. 

Continued promotion, sharing of experiences and provision of training would enable this impact to be increased. Knowledge exchange would also enable lessons learned to be shared , thus increasing capabilities of external researchers and contractors to meet decision makers' evidence needs. 

The open access paper regarding the application of lessons from systematic reviews to literature reviews also has the potential to have wider impact. This will demonstrate the benefits of methods to mitigate bias and outline practical methods of applying these to those conducting reviews in both policy and academic sectors. Engagement with the training of researchers such as with the Centres of Doctoral Training and further work with evidence specialists that support decision makers would increase this.

A number of decision makers, researchers and consultancies from around the world have expressed interest in the use of evidence reviews to meet decision makers' needs. Therefore there is potential for a number of international end-users to take up the methods and tools developed and for the UK to lead internationally in methods to provide evidence to inform environmental decision making.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D85CDC5F-5CAE-4014-B016-41E599903EC2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd53f1b96320.29691389</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-production-of-quick-scoping-reviews-and-rapid-evidence-assessments</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Developing methodologies to communicate uncertainty in summaries of evidence</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8BF33893-F04C-4EED-B8C3-D0BCB81CD99B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research into methods to assess uncertainty in summarised bodies of evidence was provided to Defra.

The guide is being used a across Defra and its delivery partners in order to design and carryout evidence reviews that meet environmental policy and practices decision makers needs. The guide has been used for a number of contracts for individual projects as well as a managed service provider contract.
