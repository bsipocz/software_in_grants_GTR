Research and Educational: 

(1) for students, especially undergraduates, in Classics, through facilitating the study, and encouraging the teaching, of Greek New Comedy in the original

(2) for researchers in Classics and Ancient History, through new insights contained especially in the Introduction and Commentary, including connections between the play and other earlier, contemporary and later texts, and between the play and its social and historical background (see also Academic Beneficiaries)

(3) for students and researchers in the art and history of drama and the theatre, through making available an up-to-date English introduction to, and commentary on, one of the best preserved examples of a genre that was the source of a 2400-year tradition of light drama, and also through the planned production and any publication (e.g. an adapted translation) arising therefrom

(4) for sixth-formers (and their equivalents in other countries), by facilitating the study of Menander as part of A level (or equivalent) syllabuses

(5) for sixth-form (and equivalent) teachers, including those teaching classical literature in translation, by enlarging their understanding of Menandrian comedy

The research benefits will be felt throughout the world. The educational benefits can be expected to be felt in all English-speaking countries in which the subjects mentioned above are taught: of my previous volume in the same series (Aeschylus, Eumenides (1989)), almost 70% of sales have been outside the UK, without counting sales of the Modern Greek translation of the volume.


Cultural:

(1) for all concerned with the theatre in whatever capacity, by adding a new ancient drama to the current theatrical repertoire through the planned production

(2) for the general public, by making this drama available both through performance and through publication of the adapted translation used for it

These impacts too should be felt in other English-speaking countries besides the UK, especially in view of Peter Meineck's residence in the USA and his many contacts there.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51104</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J005002/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FED118D3-C8D1-42BF-829F-C2CD1390FF49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA5B898B-8204-4E59-97AB-DA2B10124EED</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; Theatre - Other</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C97D3463-9A59-45DF-A24C-739A3B93B405</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigraphy &amp; Papyrology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
