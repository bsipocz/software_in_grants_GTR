As much of this selective pressure has a physical origin, the question arises of how the constraints imposed by physics influence the development of life forms. At the cellular level, the flagellum, a 10-20 micrometres long hair-like organelle highly conserved across eukaryotic species, is arguably one of the best examples of direct interaction between a cell and its environment. Indeed, the shape and beating pattern of flagella in unicellular eukaryotes have evolved to satisfy the peculiar requirements of locomotion at low Reynolds number, and the resulting swimming behaviour may have been selected to minimize the rate of encounter with predators. In multicellular organisms, the motion of large groups of flagella can have a direct impact on the extracellular environment by creating macroscopic flows which are responsible for tasks including fluid transport in the respiratory system, and breaking embryonic left-right symmetry. These flows may have also played a role in the development of multicellularity. Coordination among different flagella is often of paramount importance to perform these functions successfully. An emerging hypothesis is that coordination results from hydrodynamic interactions, yet there is very little direct experimental test of this possibility. The proposal focuses on the issue of flagellar dynamics and coordination in the Volvocales, an order of green algae. This group includes a variety of closely related species, from the unicellular biflagellate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the preferred model organism for biological studies of the eukaryotic flagellum, up to large multicellular spheroidal colonies, like Volvox carteri, with an external layer of thousands of somatic cells, responsible for locomotion. Despite their complex phylogenetic history, species in this group have fundamentally identical flagellar apparatuses, which allows a direct comparison of their beating dynamics. Our preliminary observations reveal that, despite the absence of any direct intercellular connections, the beating dynamics of different somatic cells in V. carteri is remarkably coordinated, and gives rise to a wave-like beating pattern that travels from the front to the back of the colony. This proposal aims at studying how such large scale coordination emerges from the behaviour of a single cell, with a particular focus on characterizing changes in flagellar dynamics in presence of an external mechanical stress, and the intracellular signals that cause these changes. V. carteri, with well separated somatic cells which can be isolated from the colony and studied individually, and C. reinhardtii, which is at the centre of biological research on eukaryotic flagella, are ideally suited to address this problem. The study of flagellar dynamics in the Volvocales represents a great opportunity to unravel some of the most fundamental aspects of the dynamics of the eukaryotic flagellum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most immediate beneficiaries of the proposed project will be other researchers. In biophysics and applied mathematics, the results will contribute to studies of flagellar dynamics, interflagellar synchronisation, and swimming of microorganisms. This research is almost exclusively based on theoretical models and simulations, and will greatly benefit from the comparison with detailed experimental results. This is especially true in the study of long range coordination, usually observed in organisms or tissues where visualisation of individual flagella is difficult. By studying coordination of flagella both from the same cell, and from different cells, this research will advance our knowledge of the interplay between mechanical forces and biochemical signalling, which will be of interest to the wide community working on synchronisation in coupled dynamical systems. In biology, the research will be immediately relevant to the large community studying C. reinhardtii, the principal model organism in molecular and cell biology for studies of flagellar motility. Because flagella are highly conserved across eukaryotic species, and are involved in many different tasks, the results will also be of interest to the general field that studies eukaryotic flagella and cilia (shorter than but structurally identical to flagella). Through the study of the connections between flagellar motility and intracellular calcium, the project will contribute to unravel the roles of calcium channels. This will have an immediate impact in the field of cell signalling, and it may contribute to understand the evolution of land plants. The collaboration with Dr. Glen Wheeler, an expert in intracellular calcium signalling in algae, will be fundamental to the success of the project. Our collaboration will help the development of quantitative approaches to biology, and the growth of biophysics in general, which in turn will contribute to increase UK's general competitiveness in science and technology. The project will also benefit the broader community outside academia. As cilia and flagella are present in virtually every cell in the human body, and serve a wide variety of functions, this project's findings could be of medical importance. In particular, results on motility regulation may help understand the origin of ciliopathies, genetic disorders which cause several serious syndromes in humans. Research on flagellar dynamics and regulation may ultimately benefit also industries associated with agriculture and aquaculture, as many higher plants and animals have gametes that rely on flagellar propulsion for fertilisation. Finally, the project may help devise methods to actively regulate algal motility in response to fluid flows in bioreactors. This could have an impact on the development of cost effective algal-based biofuels and carbon sequestration technologies, two areas at the center of UK's technological efforts. Effective dissemination of scientific results will be guaranteed through publications in high impact scientific journals, and the participation to national and international conferences. The University will also ensure dissemination to the wider public through its many knowledge transfer activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>282012</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Large scale synchronisation of eukaryotic flagella - Talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>01F1410D-7077-4A89-B7D3-28E7533226CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk at the 2013 Workshop on Microscale Interactions in Aquatic Environments, Les Houches, France.

These whip-like appendages, collectively referred to as undulipodia, are common to the majority of eukaryotic species, where they are involved in a variety of important biological tasks. In humans, motile cilia and flagella sustain cerebrospinal flow, provide mucociliary clearance, are fundamental for fertilisation and in the embryonic development of left-righ asymmetry. Cilia and flagella are usually found in large groups which synchronise creating wave-like patterns called metachronal waves. It is not known how this behaviour arises, what sets the direction of propagation of the wave and whether it confers any biological advantage, although several -untested- hypotheses have been put forward.



During the project, I investigated flagellar synchronisation in species from the Volvocales, a family of motile green algae comprising unicellular (e.g. Chlamydomonas), colonial and true multicellular (e.g. Volvox) species. These algae are composed of individually biflagellate cells whose flagella can be easily observed individually, and are proving to be an excellent model system for flagellar dynamics.



I have explored experimentally for the first time how the degree of synchronisation of the flagellar pair of a single Chlamydomonas cell is affected by their length, and shown that the results are compatible with the hypothesis that the basic mechanism behind synchronisation is an interplay between the direct hydrodynamic interaction between neighbouring undulipodia and the flexibility of these filaments. In the study I showed that a simple model of interacting flagella captures the essential aspects of the phenomenon. 



I then studied the collective flagellar dynamics of Volvox carteri, a multicellular species from the Volvocales, where I discovered that thousands of flagellated somatic cells display metachronal coordination despite being relatively far from each other. Working with collaborators, I showed that these metachronal waves can be monitored easily under the microscope, and these detailed observations revealed recurrent perturbations of the metachronal state, reminiscent of defects in liquid crystals. There has been no previous report of similar perturbations to metachronal waves, and their origin is currently being investigated. 

We proposed a simple model for the interacting flagella in Volvox, which generalises the single cell model mentioned previously. The model is compatible with our experimental observations and offers a simple mechanism to explain how the direction of propagation for the metachronal wave is selected. 

We are now planning further experiments to investigate the properties of Volvox metachronal waves (e.g. how collective synchronisation emerges as flagella re-grow after deflagellation) and provide a more stringent test of the proposed model. 



During the Fellowship I worked on two side-projects related to flagellar motility, derived from the main research themes of the proposal. The first aimed at clarifying what is the principal mechanism by which eukaryotic cells interact with solid boundaries. Together with collaborators I discovered that these cells interact with boundaries primarily by direct ciliary contact interactions. This is fundamentally different from the bacterial case, where the interactions are dominated by hydrodynamic effects. Understanding this difference allows the design of structures whose shape can modify predictably the motility of microorganisms, offering potentially interesting technological applications. The second project looked at interflagellar synchronisation in a flagellar dominance mutant of Chlamydomonas. We discovered that this mutant switches randomly between two different shapes of flagellar beating, and that these changes are associated to changes in the state of synchronisation: from breaststroke-like during normal beating to freestyle-like during the modified gait. Further investigation of how this synchrony switch happens promise to shed more light on the influence of beating shape on synchronisation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings on flagellar dynamics and synchronisation have been very well received from the community. Besides directly citing our papers, we had several requests for data, which we have shared. The methodology of flagellar analysis is powerful and not particularly diffocult to realise, and it has already been picked up by other groups (e.g Daniel Tam's)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>44C6F76C-DE05-431D-A9F4-1F2A19E60C4C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2258480835.946724477718862</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6B184E43-A80E-4780-B045-7A39968351DC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Emergence of synchronized beating during the regrowth of eukaryotic flagella.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7779c4544a6f686d3623696b0f0f5a20"><gtr:id>7779c4544a6f686d3623696b0f0f5a20</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Goldstein RE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d053053c01e9d7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2E68CE6B-FBBB-4C69-99F6-D0A873B2E162</gtr:id><gtr:title>Antiphase synchronization in a flagellar-dominance mutant of Chlamydomonas.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b4601d7dd0328b0829ad4b793943d36a"><gtr:id>b4601d7dd0328b0829ad4b793943d36a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Leptos KC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54636e8921a502.16387902</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2E931FCF-CDC0-408A-A101-42E2AD982DA9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hydrodynamic synchronization and metachronal waves on the surface of the colonial alga Volvox carteri.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/599837a1c5de026a82bb08a80d8a684f"><gtr:id>599837a1c5de026a82bb08a80d8a684f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brumley DR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d054054308c7cc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DC6BECA2-21AD-4C44-BCCF-1D6DAD12FF84</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ciliary contact interactions dominate surface scattering of swimming eukaryotes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/48eca91656b3ce6c8797bfd2ea6b07ab"><gtr:id>48eca91656b3ce6c8797bfd2ea6b07ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kantsler V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03a03a9324fb7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EF2FE18D-14A7-4125-BB75-5149244A32D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Flagellar synchronization through direct hydrodynamic interactions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>eLife</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/599837a1c5de026a82bb08a80d8a684f"><gtr:id>599837a1c5de026a82bb08a80d8a684f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brumley DR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2050-084X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54636e8948e549.35703430</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H028862/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A6E5CEB-ACA3-4301-98AD-C7EC310948FD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theoretical biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
