The Mahabharata, composed in Sanskrit - likely between 400 BCE and 400 CE - is a long, narrative poem that chronicles the history of the Indian people within the context of a divine struggle between good and evil. Throughout India's history, the Mahabharata has continued to be of central cultural and religious significance.

In addition to shedding new light on the Mahabharata itself, the project will demonstrate the contemporary relevance of the text in relation to a number of current debates in philosophy, politics, ethics, and religion. We will analyze all the frame dialogues, all the main discussions and debates among the central characters, and the major dialogues embedded within the main story, while at the same time examining the relationship between different dialogues with each other. Examining structural features, intertextual relationships amongst dialogues in the text, and potential avenues for a meaningful engagement with interlocutors beyond the text, this project will be both a comprehensive and programmatic study of dialogue in the Mahabharata. We will conduct our analysis by focusing on four distinct, yet interconnected, types of dialogue in the Mahabharata: 
(1) dilemmas and debates: we will analyze dialogues that address a conflict or dilemma. We will relate these dialogues to the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Dmitri Nikulin, with the following questions in mind: To what extent do dialogues in the Mahabharata offer a meaningful exploration of the nature of dialogue itself? What does the dialogical presentation of knowledge say about the nature of knowledge? 
(2) dialogues with kings: we will analyze dialogues that feature a king. We will relate these dialogues to the work of Ashis Nandy, Amartya Sen, Rajeev Bhargava,and Charles Taylor, with these particular questions in mind: To what degree does the Mahabharata offer a precedent for Indian secularism? To what extent are the ethics of the king, as offered by the Mahabharata, compatible with more secular models of governance? 
(3) dialogues with 'others': we will look at how dialogues construct social identities and negotiate the differences between such identities, whether those differences are defined along the lines of caste, race, religious tradition, or gender. We will relate these dialogues to the work of Martin Buber, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida with the following questions in mind: To what degree is an encounter with the other a starting point for ethical enquiry? To what degree does dialogue offer the possibility for growth or change through an encounter? To what degree do these dialogues provide an ethical framework for dealing with diversity and difference? 
(4) dialogues with God: we will look at dialogues that feature a divine interlocutor, with a particular focus on Krishna. We will relate these dialogues to the work of John Hick, Rowan Williams, and Bhikku Parekh as we consider the following questions: To what extent does dialogue in the Mahabharata convey a religious pluralism? What are the theological justifications for including multiple religious views?

Throughout the project we will approach the Mahabharata as a work that has retained its cognitive value and that can therefore make important contributions, interventions, and shifts in perspective to debates going on today. Similar to the way that scholars today still fruitfully draw upon the works of classical Greek and Roman thinkers when discussing contemporary issues related to philosophy, politics, ethics, and religion, we will engage with the Mahabharata as a living and relevant work with valuable insights into the human condition.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact is a core feature throughout the project, as one of the aims is to open up ways of engaging with the Mahabharata to explore its contemporary relevance. In terms of impact beyond academic communities, the project will work with teachers of RE throughout the UK to develop a teaching resource to supplement and enhance the teaching of Hinduism at AS and A levels. At the end of the project, we will host a teaching workshop at Lancaster University with a focus on the teaching of Asian religions. In addition to providing the occasion for launching the teaching resource, the workshop will stage a dialogue between university lecturers and professors of Asian religions, with AS and A level teachers of Asian religions. Through both the resource and the workshop, the project will make a positive and sustained contribution to the teaching of Asian traditions that prepares students for life in multicultural Britain. 

The teaching resource will draw upon examples from the Mahabharata to teach topics on Hinduism from the AS level and A level syllabi. Based on years of using the Mahabharata as a way of illustrating Hindu ideas and practices to first year university students, the PI will work together with RE teachers to devise a teaching resource that draws on the approachability of the main story, the exhaustive range of ideas that are articulated within the text, and the complex, yet accessible ways in which conflicting doctrines are brought together. Because it is available through so many mediums - from retellings and translations, to two TV series, to a range of comic books and storybooks, as well as a number of films and novels through its allegorical representations - the Mahabharata offers a unique opportunity to capture the imagination of students unfamiliar with the Hindu tradition, as well as to continue to engage and to challenge those with some degree of background with Hinduism. 

The teaching resource will be in the form of an electronic slideshow, like a Keynote or Power Point presentation. It will introduce the main story and its main characters, and provide a context for the Mahabharata in relation to Hinduism and to South Asian religious and cultural traditions more generally. It will contain links to translations, retellings, articles, and the Mahabharata podcast. It will also be beautifully designed, containing vivid depictions of the Mahabharata itself, images from a range of mediums within South Asian material cultures, as well as modern images to help set a number of issues and debates explored in the text within a modern context.

The teaching resource will be aimed at year 11, 12 and 13 students and will be designed to be used by teachers and students throughout all three years. There are three main areas (out of four) of the A-level syllabus that the resource will address: 
1) Belief and Sources of Authority: within this area, it will specifically address the following topics: religious pluralism; the four aims of life; concepts of karma and samsara; and the Bhagavad Gita.
2) Worship: within this area, it will address: various forms of worship.
3) Personal Deities and Family Relations: within this area, it will specifically address: the four stages of life; the caste system; diet; the means of attaining moksha; and rites of passage. 

When addressing these topics, the resource will direct students to a variety of sources to examine a particular episode or group of episodes that in one way or another address the topic. It will not attempt to summarize or interpret such episodes for students, but rather encourage an engagement with these episodes by asking students to consider a number of questions. Through engaging stories, vivid characters, and vexing ethical dilemmas, the resource will help teachers explore many of the themes they already teach in concrete and creative ways.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90229</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As outlined in our Pathways to Impact, we have established a working relationship with six schools that teach Hinduism at GCSE and/or A Level. We have already visited three of these schools this academic year and have scheduled visits to the others three. At each visit we have given a talk and led an exercise on the Mahabharata and our particular approach to it. We have also begun piloting the teaching resources through the school visits and have collected feedback forms from our visits. We know that our findings are being used because the teachers are already using the draft resources we are making. In addition to meeting the objective we set out in our Pathway to Impact, we have expanded our initial plans for impact activities by getting further financial support from Lancaster University. This further funding is allowing us enhance our impact activities in the following ways: 1) hire teaching assistants to accompany the PI on the school visits: this makes the group work more interactive and dynamic; 2) hire teaching assistants to contribute to making the teaching resources: the PI is still making the main resources, but by getting others involved, this project will now have a higher number and wider range of teaching resources; 3) pay for additional teachers' conferences: the AHRC grant only pays for one teachers' conference at the end of the project, but by getting money from our university, we are likely to have one every year during the project, which means that we are working with teachers even more closely than we had originally plans and also helps our impact have a wider reach; 4) pay for podcasts to be included as part of the resources: in addition to providing power points and worksheets (as envisaged on our application), our teaching resources will now include podcasts, which should enhance the reach of the overall impact; 5) pay for digital photography of a Mahabharata manuscript; since receiving the award, the research team has become aware of a manuscript at Edinburgh University library with beautiful illustrations of the story; we now have the funds from our university and permission from Edinburgh University library to have professional digital photos of the illustrations and to include those photos in the teaching resources.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CFD44E63-C691-486A-BE51-A3BA04D5BD5C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58b5544ad168e2.61173139</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The major milestones on the project thus far (after one year) have been: 1) reading the Mahabharata in its entirely, while taking extensive notes; 2) mapping out a detailed structure of the monograph; 3) and beginning drafts of several of the chapters. This meets the objectives we set out in our proposal for our progress after one year. 

We have also have met our objective concerning the conference in the following ways: 1) we have set a date for the conference (to take place 5, 6, and 7 July 2017); 2) we have a lineup of 18 speakers who have committed to attending the conference; 3) we have paper titles and abstracts from all but one of our contributors; 4) we have verbal commitments from the 18 speakers to contribute their final papers to our edited book.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will be taken forward by making further progress on the monograph.
