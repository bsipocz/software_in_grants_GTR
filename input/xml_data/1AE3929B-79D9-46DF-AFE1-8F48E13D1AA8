It is a collaboration between the MRC Clinical Trials Unit and NHS Blood and Transplant, a Special Health Authority with the remit to provide a reliable, efficient supply of blood, organs and associated services to the NHS.|Summary of Studies Currently Open to Recruitment:|TOPPS - Trial of Prophylactic Platelets |Platelet transfusions are given prophylactically to reduce the risk of bleeding in thrombocytopenia. This RCT compares prophylactic vs no prophylactic platelet transfusions in patients with haematological malignancies, &amp;amp; aims to demonstrate that a policy of not giving prophylactic transfusions is not inferior to the standard prophylactic policy, with respect to the proportion of patients developing moderate or severe bleeding.|TAPS - Transfusion Alternatives Pre-operatively in Sickle cell disease |Currently, people with Sickle-cell disease are routinely given a top-up blood transfusion before they undergo surgery in the belief that this helps recovery. However, there is no evidence that this practice is of benefit. This RCT aims to compares pre-operative transfusion vs no transfusion in sickle cell patients undergoing low/medium risk elective surgery. The total number of patients (from the UK and the US) to be recruited to this trial is approximately 400. |PPIP - Platelet Process Improvement Project |The current shelf-life of platelets is 5 days and this short shelf life can cause difficulties with stock control and availability of platelets. As long as no bacterial contamination can be identified, platelet packs can be kept for 7 days. Evidence from laboratory studies show that 7 day platelets function adequately. This trial aims to show that this result is corroborated when platelets are transfused to prevent and treat haemorrhage in thrombocytopenic patients. |PRISM - Trial of Prion-Filtered vs. Standard Red cells in Surgical and Multi-transfused patients |Study A: A non-randomised controlled trial aims to assess the safety of blood that has been passed through a filter to reduce prions (proteins) thought to cause vCJD. |Study B: This double blind RCT that will test the safety of filtered blood in 340 haematology/oncology patients who require regular transfusions for their medical care.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_12023/13</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>939798CA-B6AE-4C12-9DCC-A0F88F84E6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Blood</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>9A8BEDCC-D902-4C9A-8CCF-C974265EA3FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.4  Surveillance and distribution</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>046212FE-8853-46F0-B1E7-3CBA4770A15F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.4  Surgery</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
