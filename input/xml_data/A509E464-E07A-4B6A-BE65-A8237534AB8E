Analysis of these repeated measurements can be used to predict the onset or reoccurrence of a disease, predict disease progression in individuals or in groups of patients, and aid the monitoring of patients' responses to treatments. Disease progression refers to the change in the disease over time (i.e. if the disease is improving or worsening). However, these analyses can be difficult to achieve if (1) subjects leave the study before their planned sequence of measurements is complete, (2) measurements of the biomarker are below the detection limit of the measuring device, (3) consecutive measurements on the same subject are recorded close together in time, (4) the amount of error in measuring the biomarker changes with its size (magnitude) and (5) the pattern of change of the biomarker over time cannot be described by a simple straight line. Further, a disease may be monitored by more than one biomarker and the patterns of change in one biomarker may be affected by a related biomarker. Currently, non-specialist statisticians and epidemiologists do not have access to statistical methods and software that can address all of the aforementioned complications in their data.

The proposed research will be conducted by me, a statistician at the School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, and in collaboration with several experts in the project's research area. The project will develop statistical methods to address the aforementioned complications. These methods will be accompanied by guidelines and implemented in statistical software that is widely used by non-specialist statisticians and epidemiologists. The utility of the methods in answering applied research questions will be illustrated through analyses of example datasets from three ongoing studies. (1) The UK Collaborative HIV Cohort study collates information that is collected during routine care for HIV-positive patients. (2) The University Hospital of Wales is the major tertiary referral centre for neurology in Wales and provides a network of MS clinics across South East Wales. Approximately 1000 patient contacts are documented annually and clinical data are collected routinely at presentation. (3) The Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial is comparing active monitoring with radical treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) in men with localised prostate cancer. Men who refused to participate in the trial and opted for monitoring form the UK AM cohort. I will analyse data from the UK AM cohort.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aim
To develop longitudinal statistical methods for disease prediction in individuals, which are accessible to applied statisticians and epidemiologists.

Objectives
1. To develop, evaluate and apply statistical methods that allow for complex within individual correlation structures, non-ignorable dropout, left censoring of measurements, non-linear trends and temporal changes in correlation between multiple biomarker trends. 
2. To generate guidelines for conducting analyses, and produce accessible software implementing the developed methods that can be used by applied statisticians and epidemiologists.

Methodology
The proposal concerns the development of statistical methods to model one or more biomarkers whilst accounting for the issues stated in objective 1 that can complicate longitudinal analysis. The inclusion of non-stationary stochastic random terms, such as the integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process will be used to model the within-individual correlation structure. Joint modelling of the longitudinal data and one or more dropout processes will account for informative dropout. Maximum likelihood methods will be used to analyse linear mixed models with left censoring. Non-linear trends in one or more biomarkers will be modelled by fractional polynomials. All developed methods will be applied to datasets collected on patients with progressive diseases: HIV, prostate cancer and multiple sclerosis. Developed methods will be implemented as freely available routines in widely used statistical packages Stata and R. 

Scientific/medical opportunities
The developed methods will be used to answer important clinical research questions of disease prediction in individuals in three medical research areas. The provision of methods, guidelines and software for use by applied statisticians and epidemiologists will also result in clinical advancement in other areas too.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The methods that will be developed during the proposed research will be applicable to situations in which repeated measurements of one or more biomarkers are used to assess prognosis and hence choose appropriate treatment and management strategies. For example, repeated measurements of CD4 count and HIV-1 viral load are key components of the management and monitoring of HIV-positive people treated with antiretroviral therapy, while sequential PSA measurements are used to monitor men with localised prostate cancer who have chosen to delay surgery or radiotherapy. Therefore the potential non-academic beneficiaries, directly or indirectly, of the proposed research project are patients with long-term chronic diseases, and clinicians caring for such patients.

My research plan includes development of statistical software that implements the new methods. Such software will be freely available as routines for the widely used Stata and R statistical software packages. Its availability will be promoted via articles for users of this software, on local web pages, and through inclusion in well-attended short courses run in the School of Social and Medicine, such as our new course on analysis of repeated measures 
(http://www.bris.ac.uk/social-community-medicine/shortcourse/scanrepmeas.html).

The utility of the methods in answering applied research questions will be illustrated through analyses of the example datasets described in my case for support, in the diverse areas of HIV, prostate cancer and multiple sclerosis. As well as publishing academic journal articles describing the novel insights obtained, I and colleagues will present the results of these analyses at specialist conferences attended by experts in the diseases. Such presentations are attended by patient groups and can lead to patient-focussed presentations: for example I presented a poster at the 11th European AIDS Conference 2007, which was subsequently reported in &amp;quot;AIDS Treatment Update&amp;quot;, an information magazine for patients. 

I intend to seek the advice from the University of Bristol's Centre for Public Engagement. The course Plain English for Research Communications will assist me in communicating my research to a non-academic audience. The HIV cohort that I propose to analyse is part of a project (Databases for HIV: Integration, Collaboration, Engagement) which aims to raise the profile of HIV research in the HIV community. Therefore, there are mechanisms in place to communicate directly to the HIV community the contribution my research proposal will make to HIV research.

Also, I would expect patients and clinicians in other areas of medical research to benefit from my proposed research. I intend to provide statistical methods, guidelines and software for use by technical statisticians and epidemiologists in many different areas of medical research. Therefore, my proposal should result in clinical advancement in other areas too.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>350435</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have jointly developed a model to predict viral suppression in HIV-positive patients on treatment.
