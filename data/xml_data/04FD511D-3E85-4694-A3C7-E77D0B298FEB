At the same time, there has been substantial research effort into the development of computer-based simulators of human biology. Future risk assessments should be able to combine advanced biology simulators with relevant non-animal experiments to help risk assessors make predictions about adverse health effects without the use of animals.

Currently, toxicologists are far from having the same confidence in these computer-based risk assessments as they do in traditional animal-based assessments. This is partially due to most investigations of the use of the computer models focussing on just a small aspect of the risk problem. We consider the complete risk assessment process to provide more scientifically relevant information for human safety assessment. In our research, we build a coherent framework with which the non-animal experiments and simulators can be harnessed to develop new approaches for safety assessment. These approaches could give a better prediction of potential effects in humans, reduce the time and monetary costs of reliable risk assessment, and reduce the reliance on animals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Over the past decade, there has been substantial research effort into the development and utilisation of systems biology models for a range of applications. At the same time, there has been increasing pressure to end the overreliance on animal experiments within toxicology and to consider the information from non-animal alternatives when making decisions about human safety. A key challenge is to understand how the different proposed elements of a pathways-based toxicological risk assessment (e.g. chemical characterisation, human exposure information, in vitro toxicity testing data on compounds and metabolites from potentially diverse test systems, dose response modelling, population-based modelling and risk contexts) can be integrated to enable robust safety decisions.

Our objectives are to answer how mathematical models could fit into a risk assessment alongside relevant in vitro data sources and to give toxicological risk assessors more confidence in using mathematical models. To achieve this, we must understand what the key input parameters of the models are and how existing in vivo and in vitro assays can be used to validate and parameterise the models. Using data sets (e.g. ToxCast, EPA) and models, which are publicly available or provided by Unilever, and working closely with expert toxicologists and risk assessors at Unilever, we will demonstrate the potential of existing uncertainty analysis techniques to evaluate the confidence in a toxicological risk assessment decision using non-animal data. This will take the form of prototype risk assessments based on in vitro data interpreted through a systems biology model and compared to human exposure concentrations estimated using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. The approach therefore requires the linking of models at different scales and the determination of the contributions of experimental and model uncertainty to assess the confidence in the resultant risk assessment.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81195</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/K001280/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
