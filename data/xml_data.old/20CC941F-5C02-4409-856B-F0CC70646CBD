The project will support Sheffield City Council and Sheffield Homes in addressing a pressing policy need to increase digital engagement among social housing tenants.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Providers of social and community services currently face major constraints. Digital technology solutions, such as online payments, have been proposed as routes to major cost savings. Users of social and community services include the bulk of citizens who are currently digitally excluded. Moving services online may further disadvantage these groups. Lack of uptake of digital services by these communities may limit the benefits of digital services.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will apply knowledge gained from previously funded RC and community projects. The SHU team has a strong knowledge base in the issues of digital exclusion, digital engagement and community collaboration. The collaboration will focus on case studies in target social housing areas with the following stages: &lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>a survey and review of the current levels of digital exclusion;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>analysis of the data to determine which available strategies might have greatest impact; implementation of one or more interventions;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>action research based review of the interventions;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>report to partners on the effectiveness of interventions and community impacts.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This intervention project is designed to impact directly on three end user groups:

1. Sheffield City Council and Sheffield Homes - and more broadly through dissemination of the outcomes to other public sector organisations facing similar challenges.
2. Residents and users of Sheffield City Council social and housing services - and more broadly through dissemination of the outcomes to other communities facing similar challenges.
3. Other academic and public sector organisations undertaking or developing similar engagements - through providing a case study in the inter-disciplinary application and co-production of social science knowledge with end users.

The project is in and of itself an impact activity. The project will support Sheffield City Council and Sheffield Homes in addressing a well-defined and pressing policy need to increase digital engagement among social housing tenants. The project is designed to apply learning from a set of recent ESRC, EPSRC, AHRC and EU funded projects in the areas of digital inclusion, digital engagement and user centred software and service design. The project has three impact objectives. First, support for the end users, both in the public sector and community members, in meeting digital engagement targets. Second, the embedding of this knowledge base within Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Homes and the target communities. Third, the project will provide an opportunity for the academic partners to gain greater knowledge of the specific context of social housing, access to data and technologies, and develop closer working relationships with end users. 

The impact benefits are intended to be direct. The project itself is specifically designed to engender documentable impact from the application of an accumulated social science knowledge base. The project interventions will be practical and lead to the validation of digital inclusion activities to be carried forward by Sheffield City Council and Sheffield Homes over the following period. The impact will derive from:

1. The interventions themselves - be they technology or community based, though likely a combination of both
2. The three way knowledge exchange between academic, public sector and community partners
3. The dissemination of outcomes through end user workshops, policy decisions by public sector partners and academic outputs

At the close of the project it is hoped that a significant knowledge base will have been exchanged between partners to ensure high quality results from following interventions and policy decisions. Overall the project will contribute to meeting the need to support digital inclusion within communities. Such support opens up the possibility of addressing reductions in service resources through online provision, and therefore maintaining front line delivery.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59889</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tinder Foundation (Previously UK Online)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>On going collaboration with Tinder Foundation (Previously UK Online)</gtr:description><gtr:id>81F3A3D1-ADF0-4227-9459-3C8A16220679</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Continued development of research opportunities</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5466223ee65698.66825857-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided access to research context, practitioners and Social Digital Research Network</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provided access to research findings</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Go ON It's Liverpool</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>On going collaboration with GO ON its Liverpool</gtr:description><gtr:id>37B13A4C-299E-46B9-B7DC-DF829188F73A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Best practice exchange between project, Go On Its Liverpool and Sheffield City Council</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546620cf2ed2c9.35883491-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided access to practitioners and research contexts</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provided access to research results and other practitioners</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Addressing the Social in Order to Deliver the Digital' Conference/Workshop at University of Sheffield</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E226BB36-9A5E-450A-8376-139E2A46E7E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Addressing the Social in Order to Deliver the Digital', a conference organised by Sheffield University's Research Exchange for the Social Sciences (RESS) and Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Socio-Digital worlds (IRiS).

During the course of the project the Sheffield Homes was reincorporated into SCC.

There are four levels upon which the project has directly impacted the work of SH/SCC. First, the project established action research interventions in two social housing areas of Sheffield. These included the establishment of local provision co-designed by tenants, tenants reps, SH/SCC and the project. The evaluation of these, as well as national data sets provided a basis for a model of DI intervention. Second, support for the development of strategy by SH/SCC based on findings from the research. Third, knowledge exchange to allow both research and practice developments by SH/SCC and the research team. Fourth, contribution to national debates on DI issues and engagement with national networks.

Taking each in turn. The local action research projects had immediate local impact with the establishment in one case of a new ICT facility and training support in Stannington, Sheffield for older residents where no such facility had existed before. In Parson Cross work with residents led to recommendations of IT system development by the council and establishment of Job clubs to support residents engagement with new DWP job seeking &amp;quot;digital by default&amp;quot; systems. The research developed a model for intervention that had three key elements: 1] assessment of interventions against client context; 2] hyper local delivery and co-design; 3] individual engagement and assessment to link clients with appropriate support. This model has been implemented in the work of Sheffield Homes who have developed a number of Hyper local interventions and are rolling these out across relevant community centres. This model has also been taken on board by South Yorkshire Homes (Housing Association) and Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council - and has been proposed for local NHS community support (evidence base, reports, correspondence, interviews with John Lovibond and Jane Lyon SCC). Work by tenant volunteers on the SCC implementation of the recommendations has led to employment opportunities for 11 of the 40 volunteers and has provided over 1000 sessions and supported over 200 residents to date (evidence base correspondence, interviews and report from Maxine Bowler Healy Development Trust).

The Knowledge Exchange can be evidenced by continued partnership between SCC and the research team (now based across Sheffield Hallam, Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores Universities). It has underpinned bids to the &amp;quot;Digital Deal&amp;quot; and the implementation of the above policy interventions. The work has underpinned the establishment of Sheffield and Region Digital Housing Network that has run three one-day knowledge exchange events. The close of the project included a Digital Inclusion Event and conference at SCC to highlight the inclusion of DI issues in SCC ICT policy. Future support is to be given for bids to the Fairness Commission by SCC. The project has also supported a one day best-practice and knowledge exchange trip for SCC staff and a cabinet councillor (Cllr Cllr Mazher Iqbal) to meet the GO ON ITs Liverpool network led by Cllr Laura Robertson Collins - GO ON Its Liverpool is a national touchstone for best integrated multi agency practice in the DI field. These interactions have led to additional research actions including the re-assessment of the evidence base for DI benefits (CI: Kirby and PI:Yates) and a case study of digital channel shift in SCC (CI: Kirby).

The national international agenda has been influenced by the involvement of the PI (Yates) in a range of national and international networks. Yates has presented the work to key relevant major stakeholders including: Department for Work and Pensions; Government Digital Service; BT; at an SAS.com sponsored Westminster event with senior civil servants; Chartered Institute of Housing; and GO ON Its Liverpool. Additionally the PI is an active member of the UK Digital Leaders programme and has presented the finding at national and regional Digital Leaders events. The PI is currently working with Digital Leaders to establish a research forum within the network. The project developed from the start an on-going relationship with Tinder Foundation (Previously UK online) - event helping UK online find new office space - and has regularly contributed to the Tinder foundations Social and Digital research symposia. Most recently the project has been asked to contribute to the Social Policy Associations publication &amp;quot;In defence of Welfare (II)&amp;quot; intended to promote policy debate prior to the 2015 general election.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>92872F93-289F-4305-A3D2-C4BF38E4B5AB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5465e1adcd0115.81357542</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Digital exclusion is an element of contemporary social exclusion whereby citizens have no access, or limited access, to the Internet and where they lack the skills or resources to make full use of online systems and services.

Both nationally and locally in Sheffield social housing tenants are more likely than other community members to be digitally excluded.

National and local policies are now orientated towards &amp;quot;digital by default&amp;quot; approaches to the provision of services.

Digital by default assumes that online interaction will be the primary method for undertaking transactions with government both locally and nationally.

Digital transactions have the potential to make savings of the order of &amp;pound;5 to &amp;pound;10 per transaction, as compared to face-to-face or telephone transactions.

Digital by default has the potential to directly impact those who make extensive use of local and national services - especially those in social housing, on lower incomes and in marginalised communities.

Older social housing residents are more likely to be fully digitally excluded (have no access at home or elsewhere) than younger resident.

Even those social housing residents with access are likely to be low or &amp;quot;narrow&amp;quot; users of the Internet.

Those social housing residents currently off-line indicate that they are not motivated to get on online or to develop digital skills.

A failure of social housing residents to take up digital government services will prevent the major cost savings of digital by default from being realised.

Research has demonstrated substantive quantifiable educational, financial, cultural, civic, and health benefits are derived by citizens with Internet access and digital skills.

Research in the UK and the work of this project in Sheffield has identified three levels of digital inclusion/exclusion to which policy has to respond.

Engagement with community groups, and external partners has identified five areas of work needed to develop a strong digital inclusion strategy for Sheffield City Council: Branding and leadership; Access; Engagement and training; Policy support; Service design.

Practical intervention strategies suggested by residents included: Community Wi-Fi; Community broadband

Access to low cost devices; Pop-up or mobile &amp;quot;UK online centres&amp;quot;; Mobile rather than office based SCC staff

Better mobile applications; Online chat based web support; More use of SMS or email to communicate; A &amp;quot;face-book like page/account&amp;quot; for a tenants interactions with services; User centred and community co-design of services; Leadership and branding; Forced channel shift; Sheffield City Council as a Community ISP; Don't engage in digital by default - but better by digital.

Solutions rejected by tenants included: Free laptops; Set top boxes/smart TVs; Public kiosks; Mobile apps for all services

The project identified that community preferences for interventions and the potential effectiveness of interventions were not always aligned.

The project concluded that SCC needed to develop a clear digital inclusion policy that addresses the five areas of work and the engages with seven core strategic elements: Evidence based and tenant supported interventions; Proactive support and &amp;quot;triage&amp;quot; of digital exclusion for non-users and hard to reach groups; Location and community appropriate access and training &amp;quot;one-stop-shops&amp;quot;; Mapping resources regionally and locally; Collaborative networks; Specific support for key social groups; Data use and risk management.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This collaborative work was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) as a Knowledge Exchange project with Sheffield Homes (SH) and Sheffield City Council (SCC). The results of the work were intended to be directly applicable to non-academic contexts. The work was conducted by collaborative team with staff from Sheffield Homes, Sheffield Hallam and Liverpool Universities. The project sought to examine and understand digital exclusion and develop potential interventions to support inclusion. The project was designed to support SCC/SH in addressing a well-defined and pressing policy need to increase digital engagement among social housing tenants. The project was also designed to apply learning from recent academic research in the areas of digital inclusion, digital engagement and user centred software and service design.

At the close of the project a significant knowledge base has been developed between the partners that will support current and future interventions and policy decisions. Such support opens up the possibility of addressing reductions in service resources through online provision, and the possibility of joining up services across functions to therefore maintain quality of front line delivery. As noted above the project work has been directly applied to policy making by SCC and will be of relevance to other local councils and social housing providers. Constant knowledge exchange and impact on SH/SCC work was driven by the joint programme board which included senior SH staff, the SCC Director of Customer Services, the SCC Director of Business Information Solutions, the Chief Executive of UK Online/Tinder Foundation, Heeley Development Trust, the research team and invited tenant or SCC staff. This allowed the work of the project to be regularly disseminated to key partners.



Direct impacts

The following interventions were supported by the project:

 ? Community based training and support:

 o A computer club and WiFi access were provided by in Stannignton. The club has run weekly since spring 2013.

 o A &amp;quot;Job club&amp;quot; was established in Parson Cross to support local residents who needed to engage with the &amp;quot;digital only&amp;quot; Universal Job Match

 ? Service design:

 o Workshops were undertaken in Parson Cross to provide SCC with insight into user centred digital service design

 ? The intervention infrastructure and facilities for the will remain in place supported by Heeley Development Trust.



As a result of the joint work of the project board the following have been established:

 ? Sheffield Housing Digital Inclusion Network - including non-SCC social housing providers, Tinder Foundation, regional DWP and community groups (27/6/13; 16/12/13).

 ? SCC Digital Inclusion Conference (11/11/13)- meeting to establish Digital Inclusion Strategy for SCC. The work of the project has directly fed into the digital inclusion strategy for SCC through the work of the project board chair.

 ? Project informed follow-up survey work by SCC on digital exclusion for those 1,719 social housing tenants directly affected by recent Welfare Reform ('bedroom tax')

Other engagements

The team has undertaken regular engagements to ensure the broadest engagement and impact from the project, including:

 ? Project and findings presented to Chartered Institute of Housing (Leeds, 13/8/13)

 ? Project staff, data and issues discussed as part of UK Online Centre's 7th Social Digital Research Symposium (OfCom, 4/9/13)

 ? Work presented to Go On ITs Liverpool Steering Group (5/9/13)

 ? Yates (PI) and Liverpool ICC colleagues joined and supporting Go On ITs Liverpool Steering Group

 ? Invited to present project and findings presented to DWP Cross-cutting Delivery Analysis staff and Government Digital Service staff (Caxton House, London, 17/10/13)

 ? Invited to present project and findings at SAS (www.sas.com) Digital Government Breakfast Briefing (Church House, Westminster, 24/9/13)

? Project organised a best-practice exchange visit by SH/SCC senior staff and SCC cabinet member (Cllr Mazher Iqbal) to Liverpool City Council (Cllr Laura Robertson-Collins) and Go On ITs Liverpool partners (4/10/13)

The project team is now based in two locations, Sheffield and Liverpool. The team will continue to work with colleagues in key stakeholder organisations - in particular SCC, Go On ITs Liverpool and Tinder Foundation. SHU is continuing to support the work of Dr. Kirby who is undertaking in depth qualitative work with staff at SCC. Prof. Yates is working with colleagues in Liverpool and Sheffield to explore the role of the CDI sector in addressing digital and social exclusion. Using final report to SCC the team intends to continue disseminating the findings to key stakeholders. A comparative analysis of the projects hyper-local data with national data (OfCom and OxIS) has allowed the development of a model of digital exclusion that the team is currently preparing for publication. More broadly the team will continue to engage the national stakeholders already identified above (DWP, Government Digital Service, Chartered Institute of Housing) as well as those who have recently expressed an interest in the work, such as charities (Shelter), major telecoms providers (BT, EE) and political actors (Labour Party). Through these engagements the team hope to continue to contribute to the debate on digital exclusion and digital government services.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>22098513-24F8-45C3-87DE-2B44BB880729</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3604942554.2400613775e8212</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://iccliverpool.ac.uk/publications/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Direct input into the development of Digital Inclusion policy by Sheffield City Council</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9600353-5B43-405F-A31A-6A2A28E3C7AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The local action research projects had immediate local impact with the establishment in one case of a new ICT facility and training support in Stannington, Sheffield for older residents where no such facility had existed before.

This knowledge exchange project was a collaborative intervention in the area of digital inclusion. The project supported Sheffield City Council and Sheffield Homes in addressing a pressing policy need to increase digital engagement among social housing tenants. Providers of social and community services currently face major constraints. Digital technology solutions, such as online payments, have been proposed as routes to major cost savings. Users of social and community services include the bulk of citizens who are currently digitally excluded. Moving services online may further disadvantage these groups. Lack of uptake of digital services by these communities may limit the benefits of digital services. This project will apply knowledge gained from previously funded RC and community projects. The SHU team has a strong knowledge base in the issues of digital exclusion, digital engagement and community collaboration. The collaboration will focus on case studies in target social housing areas with the following stages: a survey and review of the current levels of digital exclusion; analysis of the data to determine which available strategies might have greatest impact; implementation of one or more interventions; action research based review of the interventions; report to partners on the effectiveness of interventions and community impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>75251072-2442-4C36-8835-4694EF960027</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None known to date</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546617936750a8.82300901</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Survey of interest use and attitudes across two social housing areas in Sheffield</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=851165&amp;type=Data%20catalogue</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1211C307-6AD1-4E9D-9304-CDA27E78AF33</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digital Media Use: Differences and Inequalities in Relation to Class and Age</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociological Research Online</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1f3aa2aedeb712870d475a4737c2d2a1"><gtr:id>1f3aa2aedeb712870d475a4737c2d2a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yates S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56de7941a9b292.88079467</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F10AB5C3-453D-4E04-8E76-12F17233A833</gtr:id><gtr:title>Supporting Digital Engagement: A final report to Sheffield City Council</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/039ae8ca08acf3987ea8ca777898e262"><gtr:id>039ae8ca08acf3987ea8ca777898e262</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yates SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464730b7e0e89.75875193</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>35747E03-9616-4165-A94A-27416B52A90E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Citizen Participation and Political Communication in a Digital World</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cc4a6bbcfccd97c87b478beaf0bafd6e"><gtr:id>cc4a6bbcfccd97c87b478beaf0bafd6e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yates, S.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-13-893503-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56de7da382dda2.37116500</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3E997A24-6DAE-4C8C-A9A5-7F7C9B6EDCFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>In Defence of Welfare II</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cc4a6bbcfccd97c87b478beaf0bafd6e"><gtr:id>cc4a6bbcfccd97c87b478beaf0bafd6e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yates, S.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781447327929</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56de7c3f4df7d8.82203579</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A9FA7EA0-D17D-45EE-92AC-5A200AB95E7A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digital inclusion and exclusion: The social challenges of a networked society</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/039ae8ca08acf3987ea8ca777898e262"><gtr:id>039ae8ca08acf3987ea8ca777898e262</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yates SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:isbn>TBC</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>546471b3650f92.78376567</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J020869/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2968C870-0FF4-4AE9-A670-9B0161C83B37</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>New Media/Web-Based Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
