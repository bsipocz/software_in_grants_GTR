Such 'editing' by ADARs results in adenosine, one of the building blocks that make up RNA, being converted to inosine (I). When such changes are made at many positions ('hyper-editing') within a double-stranded RNA molecule (dsRNA), there are various functional consequences. Our research is focused on understanding one important role of hyper-edited inosine-containing dsRNA (IU-dsRNA) in mammalian cells.

Analysis of mice in which ADAR genes have been deleted highlights the importance of RNA editing in mammalian cells. Deletion of one family member, ADAR1, results in embryonic lethality. Moreover, death of ADAR1 mutants results from inappropriate production of interferon, a molecule produced during immune responses, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Our previous data provides an explanation for this observation. We have shown that IU-dsRNA, the product of editing by ADARs, directly inhibits interferon production and apoptosis. Conversely, in the absence of ADAR1, the interferon response is upregulated, presumably due to the lack of IU-dsRNA. Our current research proposal aims to determine precisely how IU-dsRNA inhibits the pathway leading to interferon production and apoptosis. 

When mammalian cells are treated with poly(IC), a long dsRNA that mimics viral infection, signaling pathways are triggered that result in production of interferon and apoptosis. We have previously demonstrated that IU-dsRNA interferes with the recognition of poly(IC) by two dsRNA sensors, RIG-I and MDA5. By interfering with poly(IC) recognition, RIG-I and MDA5 are not activated, the pathway that results in interferon production remains switched off, and interferon levels remain low. We now plan to carry out experiments that aim to understand the interaction that occurs between IU-dsRNA and RIG-I or MDA5. This will lead to a better understanding of how IU-dsRNA functions in this pathway, and how it is regulated. We additionally plan to directly test the effect of IU-dsRNA on viral infection. In particular, we will test whether the presence of IU-dsRNA in mammalian cells affects infection by influenza A virus. Use of influenza A constitutes an ideal model system as it triggers interferon production by activating RIG-I. In addition, influenza virus A RNA undergoes hyper-editing by ADAR1. We will thus apply our previous findings to examine the effects of editing and IU-dsRNA in a broader biological context. Our experiments so far have made use of short synthetic IU-dsRNAs as a model system to mimic editing in cells. While these have been invaluable for illuminating the roles of ADARs in mammalian cells, we will now undertake experiments to identify cellular IU-dsRNAs that are similarly able to suppress interferon production. This will be an important undertaking in order to better understand how hyper-editing targets cellular RNAs in order to downregulate IFN.

The finding that ADAR1 is essential for suppressing interferon signaling suggests it may protect organisms from the deleterious effects of interferon activation associated with many pathological processes, including chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and cancer. By carrying out our proposed project to investigate how IU-dsRNA suppresses interferon and apoptosis, we will be closer to understanding the function of ADAR1 in mammalian cells that make it critical for survival.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We have previously shown that the presence of inosine-containing dsRNA (IU-dsRNA) in mammalian cells suppressed interferon (IFN) induction and apoptosis in response to long dsRNA. Moreover, both effects could be accounted for by our observation that IU-dsRNA inhibited activation of IRF3 (IFN regulatory factor 3), a key component in the pathway by which long dsRNA induces IFN and apoptosis. In addition, our data suggested that IU-dsRNA acts at an early step in the pathway by inhibiting MDA5 (melanoma differentiation association protein 5) or RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), which act as cytosolic sensors for dsRNA. These observations together lead us to propose that any IU-dsRNA generated by ADAR1 can directly inhibit IFN induction and apoptosis.

We now aim to examine the molecular mechanism underlying the observation that IU-dsRNA suppresses IFN induction and apoptosis. We will use a combination of cell biology, molecular biology and biochemistry to investigate the specific interaction between IU-dsRNA and RIG-I or MDA5. Structural analyses will also be used to examine the molecular detail of this interaction. We will use quantitative proteomics to determine whether IU-dsRNA interacts with additional components of the IFN pathway, which may also be important for inhibiting IFN. The observation that IU-dsRNA inhibits IFN suggests editing may be pro-viral in mammalian cells. We will explore this idea using influenza A virus (IAV) as a model system. IAV triggers an IFN response via activation of RIG-I, and undergoes hyper-editing by ADARs. Finally, we aim to identify cellular IU-dsRNA(s) that suppress IFN induction and apoptosis. CLIP-Seq (Cross-Linking/Immunoprecipitation/Sequencing) will be used to identify edited RNAs interacting with RIG-I or MDA5, and the effect of these RNAs on IFN induction in mammalian cells will be validated using qPCR. In undertaking this analysis we will better understand the critical role(s) of RNA editing in mammalian cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The project described constitutes basic research that aims to understand a fundamental cellular process that potentially plays an important role in innate immunity and disease. The immediate impact of the proposed work will largely be academic, in that it will contribute to scientific advancement and provide training opportunities for researchers in an important field of research. This research will thus generate expertise that will potentially benefit the wider scientific community. Moreover, in the longer term, scientific advances in this field has the potential to be exploited by the life sciences industry, which draws on knowledge generated by pure biological sciences. This research may thus contribute to the development of therapies or drugs related to immune defense. In addition, this research might be used to improve the methodology for creating pluripotent stem cells. This research may therefore also benefit the wider public by having an impact on health and disease. 

How will they benefit from this research?

(a) Training and development: As the research project described includes a number of specialized experimental approaches, it will provide a rich training ground for the post-doctoral researcher. The researcher will thus develop a vast range of experimental skills and knowledge that will have long-term implications for further career opportunities. Highly trained and motivated research scientists are invaluable within both the academic and commercial sectors, so will have a wide pool of potential beneficiaries. 

(b) Understanding disease and immune defence mechanisms: Deletion of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 in mice is lethal. Moreover, lethality results from inappropriate interferon (IFN) signalling and apoptosis. The finding that ADAR1 is essential for suppressing IFN induction suggests it may protect organisms from the deleterious effects of IFN activation associated with many pathological processes, including chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and cancer. Dysregulation of RNA editing has also been linked to various diseases, including neurological disorders and tumourigenesis. 
The project described aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which edited RNA (IU-dsRNA) downregulates IFN induction and apoptosis. In so doing, we will be closer to understanding the essential function of ADAR1 in mammalian cells. In understanding how ADAR1 functions in immune responses and disease, potential commercial opportunities for exploiting these findings may become apparent. In particular, development of drugs and therapies to combat disease and infections might be made possible by understanding the role of RNA editing in these processes.

(c) Development of pluripotent stem cells: The reprogramming of differentiated cells to pluripotency holds great promise as a tool for studying normal development, while offering hope that patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells could be used to model disease or to generate clinically useful cell types for autologous therapies aimed at repairing deficits arising from injury, illness, and aging. 
A novel method was recently described for reprogramming differentiated cells to pluripotency, which involved transfection of RNAs encoding essential proteins. However, various tricks were necessary to prevent the cells' innate antiviral defenses from attacking the foreign RNA and triggering apoptosis. 
We have identified an IU-dsRNA that suppressed IFN induction in response to transfected RNAs. This finding could thus be useful in refining the technologies used to produce the RNA-induced pluripotent stem cells. Co-transfection of cells with the short IU-dsRNA and the RNAs required for reprogramming would improve the efficiency of the existing method. Our research would thus make a considerable commercial impact on the development of cell-based therapies and regenerative medicine.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>376863</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Fair, University of Cambridge</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>314B49D1-5D02-4001-A8F6-3A1DA6688312</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Science Fair is held annually within the University of Cambridge, and our Department (Dept of Biochemistry) provided a focussed activity with hands on opportunities to join in with some science.

We have characterized the specific binding of RIG-I with inosine-containing (IU-dsRNA). This analysis entailed the preparation of a large number of plasmids expressing epitope-tagged full-length RIG-I or fragments of RIG-I, which were subsequently expressed in HeLa cells. In vitro pull-down assays using biotinylated IU-dsRNA were then used to show that IU-dsRNA interacts specifically with the helicase and C-terminal region of RIG-I. Competition experiments were subsequently used to show that binding of IU-dsRNA with RIG-I competed with substrate binding (E.g. poly(IC)). These data therefore are important for understanding how IU-dsRNA can interfere with the cellular interferon response triggered by long dsRNA.
? We have carried out experiments to elucidate the structure of RIG-I in a complex with IU-dsRNA. This analysis was performed in collaboration with Professor Ben Luisi, Dept of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge. Whilst we have so far been unable to grow stable crystals of RIG-I and IU-dsRNA, we have generated a significant number of crystals of IU-dsRNA alone that have yielded high-resolution data sets. We are currently carrying out experiments with modified IU-dsRNA (E.g. bromine) in order to refine and solve the structure of IU-dsRNA. An understanding of the structure of IU-dsRNA will provide important insights into its unexpected role in immune pathways, and contribute to understanding its mode of recognition by specific proteins in mammalian cells. These data will also provide insights into how the editing pathways may interact with other important cellular pathways involving dsRNA (E.g. RNAi). 
? A collaboration with the lab of Mary O'Connell was established, and we made a significant contribution to a study that also aimed to understand the role of ADAR1 in innate immunity. Previous work had shown that ADAR1 null mice have aberrant interferon induction and die by embryonic day 12.5. The O'Connell lab went on to demonstrate that the ADAR1 embryonic lethality was rescued to live birth in ADAR1;MAVS double mutants in which the antiviral interferon induction response to cytoplasmic dsRNA was prevented. In keeping with our findings, they proposed that inosine in cellular RNA inhibits antiviral inflammatory and interferon responses by altering interactions with RIG-I or MDA5. Experiments were subsequently performed using reagents developed in my lab; we thus showed that transfection of dsRNA oligonucleotides containing IU pairs into ADAR1 mutant mouse embryo fibroblasts reduces the aberrant innate immune response. These findings therefore made a significant contribution to understanding the fundamental role of ADAR1 in immune pathways. These data were published in Cell Reports (Mannion et al., 2014, Cell Reports 9, 1482-1494).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Reagents generated during the course of the project will be key for future investigations. For example, many plasmids expressing full length or mutant epitope-tagged proteins (E.g. RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS) have been generated and will be important for future work. In addition, we have developed robust purification schemes to generate large quantities of recombinant RIG-I that will enable in vitro studies to be performed (E.g. structural analyses, binding studies etc).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7A2D91FD-7CA4-4D59-80A4-C6CD92152C16</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cf29b71947b5.04448067</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>52D5E84E-4345-4D84-B155-6057AB57B3AE</gtr:id><gtr:title>The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 controls innate immune responses to RNA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cell reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0c81e36f4ff995ae0509b3fc01eba363"><gtr:id>0c81e36f4ff995ae0509b3fc01eba363</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mannion NM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cf256ea45433.68967018</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/J007935/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73EF98E1-3FA8-46A0-BE46-00AE16C7D999</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Communication &amp; signalling</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CC10CC12-1D16-48BD-8F66-6A64A651DEAB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gene action &amp; regulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1163A5D2-CE35-4C7E-904E-6FB2B5FA0C2A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Multiprotein complexes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
