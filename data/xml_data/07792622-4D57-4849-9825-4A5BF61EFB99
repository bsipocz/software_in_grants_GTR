In detail the relationship between secularism and the rise of sexual liberation over the course of les Trent gloriousness and afterwards. 
In particular, I analyse how the Catholicism reacted to sexual freedom and modernity, both ethically and theologically.

The polarisation of the church and secularism over this period confirmed an emerging consensus that modernity was commensurate with secular ideas of individualism, freedom, and sexual liberation. Progress, in short, was on the side of secularism; religion was synonymous with pre-modernity and sexual repression. This consensus was challenged most notably by Marcel Gauchet in his seminal work Le Desenchantement du monde (i 985) which heralded the return to religion because of a perceived disenchantment with secularism and modernity. For Gauchet, this return did not mean a return to orthodoxy but a return to religion rekindled in the light of social and progressive democratic values and in tune with individual aspirations.

This return to religion has ushered in the beginning of a post-secular age. On the one hand, post-secularism represents a challenge to orthodox Catholicism and democratic republicanism by privileging individual will, autonomy and private interest over divine law and collective interest. On the other hand, it has brought religion in from the cold of modernity, made it matter, and offered a new dimension to citizens' lives which they now want reflected in their wider claims to citizenship. The critical issue for my book is the interface between sexual difference and religion in this post-secular context. If secularism paved the way for a greater accommodation between sexual difference and social democracy, post-secularism offers a potentially new but problematic accommodation between sexuality and religion

Aims and Objectives:

The historical context of this monograph is the tension between the Church's theological discourse of resistance to gay sexuality (60s/70s), and a secular culture characterised by sexual liberation and increasing gay visibility. The analysis will focus on the shifting secular and religious perceptions of sexuality in French society in the 80s and 90s, the recent debates on a 'retour du religieux' and the emergence of religion as a new player in debates on citizenship. 1 aim to show how Catholic theology (traditionally resistant to gay sexuality) has been reinforced under recent pontificates, but also challenged in a post-secular France by alternative and radical theological thinking inflected by social diversity, and political and sexual democratisation. To achieve this over-arching aim, I intend to:

 evaluate the historical relationship between Christian theology and gay sexuality in the context of secular modernity in France
 engage with traditional theological discourses on gay sexuality
 establish the key elements of the 'post-secular' debate
 analyse the effects of post secularism
 explore the emergence of alternative theological discourses in the construction of gay sexuality
 evaluate the reception and contribution of theological debates on gay sexuality in the contexts of French republicanism, democracy and citizenship
 engage critically with debates on sexual ethics in France

Potential Applications and Benefits:

The originality of this research lies in its location at a critical juncture of theological and philosophical change, in the critical contribution of theology to the currency of lesbian and gay sexuality, and in the implications for gay sexual ethics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-01-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19813</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D500117/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6C41006C-514B-4763-BE82-812123897818</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
