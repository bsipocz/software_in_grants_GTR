The project showcases the artwork made by research participants (people living with dementia), trains other artists and care staff using the creative approach developed during the project, and raises awareness of dementia and of the D&amp;amp;I findings with a wide and varied audience, extending beyond the geographical focus of the original research. 

The project tours a specially commissioned art installation (The Imagination Caf&amp;eacute;) to 3 locations, Llandudno, Edinburgh and London (the venues are MOSTYN, Edinburgh College of Art and the Menier gallery respectively). They have been selected for their interest in developing new skills and collaborations to promote working creatively with people living with dementia. The installation is in the form of a pop-up caf&amp;eacute;, displaying artwork made during D&amp;amp;I on its walls. A prototype caf&amp;eacute; will be designed, installed and tested in Nottingham before the tour begins (as part of D&amp;amp;I dissemination activities). The Imagination Caf&amp;eacute; will be tailored for each touring location as part of the proposed project, in conjunction with collaborators in Llandudno, Edinburgh and London.

The immersive, experiential space will feature artwork made by people living with dementia during D&amp;amp;I, offering specially created refreshments for people living with dementia, devised by nutritional consultant Jane Clarke. The caf&amp;eacute; will staffed by volunteers on each site for up to a week, and will offer creative activities, led by artists involved in the D&amp;amp;I project. Supported by host collaborators in each location, the team will engage with local organisations including schools, community groups and healthcare professionals to ensure a wide network of people visit and benefit from the activity. This includes offering events focussing on art and music, and Admiral Nurse and Alzheimer's Society drop-in sessions. ation and materials related to dementia will be available for the public to consider and read. Attendees will be invited to leave comments in a diary room. 

Artists from D&amp;amp;I will offer training to other artists and social care staff in each area via a full day workshop. This will share the creative approach developed during D&amp;amp;I and will facilitate the impact and legacy of the project in the longer term. 

The project aims to test the feasibility of an accessible, inclusive and touring art installation, bespoke to each location, to create awareness of dementia and to showcase creative activities that are being developed and tested in the field. It builds on existing collaborations and develops new ones across a wide geographical area, to ensure that the value of the original research is maximised and to develop skill and expertise in arts and dementia with new collaborators from a variety of sectors, alongside raising public awareness about dementia more generally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will build on interdisciplinary relationships developed with artists, cultural organisations, community groups and people living with dementia during D&amp;amp;I in the following ways:

Economic
The project aims to empower charities and cultural sector organisations to offer services in accessible, and often free, public spaces, reaching more people and potentially making cost savings in the way that services are delivered. 

The wider provision of evidence-based creative activities offers potential cost benefits in terms of reducing the need for other interventions e.g. staff monitoring of people living with dementia. 

Social 
The project is likely to benefit people living with dementia, as it will showcase their creative abilities, allowing their artwork to be viewed by a wider and more diverse audience than it was during D&amp;amp;I. 

The project aims to challenge and change public perceptions about the condition and should stimulate discussion and engagement with this serious health issue, potentially lessening stigma and fear associated with the condition.

We will build new networks of people interested in creative approaches to dementia care, over a wider geographical area, thus ensuring that learning from D&amp;amp;I is shared and disseminated effectively, beyond academic outputs. 

The project should benefit the wider community of people impacted by dementia as it will provide training for a new group of artists and social care staff to enable them to deliver and commission evidence-based approaches to the use of visual arts in dementia care settings. 

The project will develop new collaborative relationships with cultural, academic, commercial and community stakeholders working alongside people living with dementia and their carers, e.g. MOSTYN is a new collaborator, keen to extend its work with people living with dementia after an initial project with a community group and an artist in Conwy in 2016, and Jane Clarke is a nutritional consultant who has devised a special menu to nourish people living with dementia. She worked previously as a consultant on the Jamie's School Dinners project and has similarly ambitious plans to influence policy and practice in dementia care nutrition and catering. PS/Y is an art and curatorial organisation with excellent links to the contemporary art sector and a track record of working on mental health topics such as hysteria. The Dementia, Arts and Wellbeing Network are funded by the AHRC and are a group of academics, clinicians and arts practitioners who have been involved in a consultation about the prototype Imagination Caf&amp;eacute; installation developed in Nottingham. They are keen to continue to provide input and expertise to the proposed touring project. 

Involving doctoral students from TAnDEM (Alzheimer's Society's Arts and Dementia doctoral training centre, University's of Nottingham and Worcester) gives them valuable experience of stakeholder consultation, working with artists and senior researchers, and engaging with the community as a public engagement exercise. 

Cultural
The artist training will provide an opportunity to test the toolkit developed as part of D&amp;amp;I. 

Artists from the D&amp;amp;I study will be involved in developing and delivering the training thus equipping them with valuable skills for their career development and enabling a new generation of artists and care staff to engage with the approach developed, delivered and evaluated during D&amp;amp;I. This promotes knowledge transfer from D&amp;amp;I and will assist the artists with disseminating their skills and knowledge beyond D&amp;amp;I. 

Policy
The project aims to empower charities and cultural sector organisations to reach new audiences and alter working practices by using an innovative 'pop up' format that addresses a serious health issue. 

The project aims to empower a range of artists and care staff to build skills in delivering artistic activities specially designed for people living with dementia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79860</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R004900/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0A51EF84-2B22-45D2-B583-F65878427D68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gerontology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
