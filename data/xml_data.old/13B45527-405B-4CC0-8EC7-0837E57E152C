Working-class women's activism during the miners' strike was unprecedented in scope and key to keeping the strike going. The time is right for a major oral history project on the strike, using it as a lens to examine working-class experiences and subjectivities more broadly in postwar Britain.

We will address the project's overarching aim via the following research objectives:

1. We will co-produce with women from coalfield communities a major new oral history project: the first major study of women's activism in coalfields during the miners' strike, examining the causes, forms, and consequences of activism. This will involve 75 new oral history life-story interviews, 10 group interviews and one reminiscence day.
2. The research will be co-produced throughout through single and group oral histories. Findings will be shared and debated with interviewees and communities through 10 public workshops. The project website and monthly e-newsletter for all project associates (interviewees and other interested parties) will be another route for sharing findings. Research will also be shared with communities through the temporary exhibition at the National Coal Mining Museum (NCMM) and online exhibition. Understanding one's own history is key to the vitality of communities, and the project aims to significantly impact coalfield communities' understandings of their own recent history.
3. Our monograph (written in the 2 years after project) will be the first major historical analysis of women's activism in the miners' strike.
4. It will also, however, encompass a wider study of working-class women in coalfield communities' lives since 1945: their experiences, identities and subjectivities. Our interviews will be life-story interviews, allowing us to examine continuity and change over the long-term. We will hone in on questions about 'feminism' in interviews, to develop important new understandings of the impact of 'Second Wave' feminism on British society after 1968, and of the 'vernacular' discourses of gender equality which circulated in post-1945 British society; the latter have been largely overlooked thus far in existing historiography.
5. We will enhance public understanding of women's activism during the strike, working-class women's lives, and feminism, through our temporary exhibition at the NCMM and the permanent exhibition on the project website. Tapping into significant popular interest in the miners' strike and the history of 'ordinary' people, the project will highlight the importance of women's political activism (histories of activism and politics often focus on men). We also aim to provoke people to think about what different meanings 'feminism' can have. A workshop with feminist groups and History Acts will impact on contemporary feminist groups' understandings of feminist history and intersectionality. 2 complete lesson plans for Key Stage 3 history teachers (also on the project website) will enable school students to grapple with the sources and issues.
6. Our work will transform the research landscape, significantly impacting on the historiography of postwar Britain, including theoretical and methodological debates, and gender and feminist studies. We will present at 2 international conferences and disseminate our findings to academic audiences through a monograph and 3 peer-reviewed journal articles.
7. We will produce a major new collection of life-story oral history interviews with working-class women, to be archived at the National Coal Mining Museum (along with new physical archival collections relating to the strike). This will create a major new resource for historians to further develop understandings of working-class life in postwar Britain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will impact:

- women in coalfield communities with whom we will co-produce the research;
- coalfield communities more broadly, via community groups, local history societies and family history networks;
- National Coal Mining Museum of England (project partner);
- general public, particularly those interested in history of mining, 'ordinary people', and women; 
- school students/education;
- feminist activist groups.

The new oral histories and archival collections will benefit the NCMM, giving them new resources to use in future research and exhibitions, in particular on women, and expanding their holdings relating to coalfields outside of Yorkshire (which they are keen to do). In a time of reduced funding for heritage, we will produce a temporary exhibition with the museum and impact positively on their long term resourcing.

We will significantly impact on the women from coalfield communities with whom we will co-produce this new history. Many of these women were involved in a unique and highly significant moment of history; their activism helped to sustain the miners' strike for an entire year. Co-producing new narratives and understandings of the strike, women's place in it, and women's changing lives across the postwar era will reconstitute networks of women which generally disintegrated after the strike. Women will have the chance to reflect, singly and together, on the strike and on their lives more broadly. It is important that the voices of women, particularly working-class women, should be heard, valorised and recorded for posterity; this still happens too rarely.

We will hold public workshops to debate findings, inviting local history societies, family history networks and community groups. This will provide a chance for communities to feed into the research and reflect on their recent history, change and continuity over time, and changing gender roles and activism. A community's sense of itself rests on an understanding of its past; participating in commemorating and analysing history can be a powerful experience for communities, generating shared understandings of place, history and politics.

The general public, particularly those interested in the strike and in the social and cultural history of women, the working class, and 'ordinary people', will be able to access the research through the temporary exhibition at the NCMM (listening posts will remain up for 5 years in the museum), and the online version of the exhibition. There is much public interest in these themes, as suggested by films like Pride (2014), and Billy Elliott (2000); and by the success of popular history books written by academics - such as Selina Todd's The People (2014). The project has the opportunity to significantly impact on popular understandings; the temporary exhibition at the NCMM plus permanent exhibition on the project website will make people rethink the importance of women to the winning of the strike, and think more broadly about social change and gender.

School students will be provoked to think about the importance of women's activism, and about activism, trade unionism, gender, and local history, via the dedicated educational resources that will be produced. Two lesson plans will be developed in conjunction with the NCMM's existing teachers' networks, plus Holy Trinity school in Barnsley (another project partner). Our project partner in Barnsley will trial these resources; links made in the other coalfield communities will be used to publicise the resources to schools there, giving students in these areas the chance to learn about their own local history, engaging them with their own past.

We will work with History Acts, a radical history forum run by Birkbeck which brings together historians and activist groups; we will jointly run a 2 hour workshop bringing together three contemporary feminist activist groups to discuss our research findings and their significance for activism today.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200871</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R003521/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B3EEA164-1D93-42E8-8073-95FEBCFA2519</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mining &amp; Minerals Extraction</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
