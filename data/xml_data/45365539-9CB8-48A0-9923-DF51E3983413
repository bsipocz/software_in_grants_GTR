Some have argued that this implies that children are born with some kind of innate bias to map the agent (i.e. ?doer?) of the action onto the first noun in a sentence.&amp;nbsp;However, previous studies have not clarified whether successful comprehension by 2-year-olds is driven by a ?first noun = agent? bias or whether their comprehension is driven by other sentential cues.&amp;nbsp;This project investigates this issue by measuring both eye-gaze and pointing preferences of 25-month-olds, 41-month-olds and adults to one of two video clips (e.g. girl acts on boy on one side of the screen and boy acts on girl on the other side of the screen) whilst listening to either active transitive sentences (such as ?the girl is glorping the boy?) or passive sentences (such as ?the boy is being glorped by the girl?). If participants do show a ?first noun = agent? bias, they should prefer to look at the clip in which the first-mentioned noun is the agent, but only whilst they hear the initial part of the sentence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79814</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project assessed how we develop the parsing strategies that are required to interpret English sentences successfully. This is an important question because the answer tells us whether we learn these parsing strategies via experience or whether they are built into the architecture of the brain's language learning mechanism. Ours was the first project to assess this question in children as young as 2 years of age using eye gaze data, which allows us to follow children's developing interpretation of a sentence in real time and shows us how their parsing strategies change as the sentence unfolds. We assessed whether 2- and 3-year-olds prefer to interpret the first noun in a sentence as the agent of an action, even when such a strategy is misleading (as in the case of passive sentences such as 'the baby is being saved by the fireman'). Our findings support the view that both 2- and 3-year-olds process sentences incrementally, having different biases at different structural positions. Neither age group has a whole-sentence first-noun-as-agent bias, but they do show this bias whilst processing the first noun phrase. Another finding is that 3-year-olds are able to override this bias in order to correctly map both active and passive sentences onto appropriate meanings. This contrasts with previous findings that even 5-year-olds are unable to override initial sentence misinterpretations. In sum, this research has led to a deeper understanding of how first language learning mechanisms are intertwined with the sentence processing mechanisms seen in adults.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Directly: Preferential-looking research into the first language acquisition of active transitive sentences is a relatively large field which has attracted much attention from academics in the USA, Canada, Germany, France, Australia and UK. The primary beneficiaries will be these scholars and researchers in the international and national language development community, as well as researchers who model this development and researchers in sentence processing in adults looking to inform models of sentence processing with models of language acquisition. 
Indirectly: Although the impact of our grant will primarily be scientific, there are two findings which could have impact on early years' professionals and speech and language therapists (SLTS). Firstly, these groups (particularly SLTS) are often taught that passive sentences are a complex area of grammar which typically developing children do not learn until they reach school age. Our results indicate that this is not the case. 3&amp;frac12;-year-olds were clearly able to demonstrate correct understanding of full passive sentences, even with novel verbs, with both measures. This is relevant in terms of what SLTs should expect children with language impairments to be able to do.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9045A48E-E8E4-46B1-A60C-308EAC63FE7C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54635e89863876.61501756</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0D0334D9-29CD-4DE9-927D-8B04990D86B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Multiple syntactic processing biases that change over development.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/69429c5925bc408af7bd63a61b465b04"><gtr:id>69429c5925bc408af7bd63a61b465b04</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbot-Smith K F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546363bf12ee12.42938914</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A420ACF-4D42-4A35-A95F-40841C1FAF15</gtr:id><gtr:title>Two and three year old children use an incremental first-NP-as-agent bias to process transitive sentences</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>currently under review since 23rd December 2016</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/69429c5925bc408af7bd63a61b465b04"><gtr:id>69429c5925bc408af7bd63a61b465b04</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbot-Smith K F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546366dab91576.20173481</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DFDFA054-EE0E-426E-93FB-EAD161236E4A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identifying the agent: How children learn and use semantic roles</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/41ac8011720409c82ac41027164e099a"><gtr:id>41ac8011720409c82ac41027164e099a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Caroline  Rowland</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_7545982458cb415466</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C5EE3DE3-B6D1-4569-97CE-24FF75E6DAFA</gtr:id><gtr:title>First NP-as-agent bias does not prevent active from passive discrimination in 25-month-olds.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/69429c5925bc408af7bd63a61b465b04"><gtr:id>69429c5925bc408af7bd63a61b465b04</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbot-Smith K F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5628e8bef12f99.30133496</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E14C6477-9DA7-4832-95CF-60669975A77B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comprehension of passive sentences with novel verbs by 25- and 42-month-olds.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/69429c5925bc408af7bd63a61b465b04"><gtr:id>69429c5925bc408af7bd63a61b465b04</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abbot-Smith K F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5628e942077273.80020682</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3968</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/H031863/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
