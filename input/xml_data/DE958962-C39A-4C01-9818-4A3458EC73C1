The main focus of this is 'personalisation', a strategy to enable people to control their own individual budgets so that they can choose the services that they need. Although individual budgets have operated successfully for disabled people, early evidence suggests older people may be less comfortable with this. Older people do want to have their say about services and the importance of enabling older people have a voice has been recognised.This project will contribute to effective and ethical ways to enable older people to have a voice in the changes that are taking place in welfare services, as well as their own support services. &lt;br />&lt;br />The project will develop a knowledge exchange between researchers, practitioners and older people.The aim is to build understanding of how to involve older people in decision making in ways that can contribute to well-being. It is based on both findings and practice experience of working with older people as co-researchers in studying well-being.

Between January 2013, when the resources were launched at AgeUK headquarters, and July 2013, the 6 films (CS 4) were accessed a total of 486 times and the accompanying handbook downloaded 696 times. 100 DVD versions have been distributed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8465881336.9142659c9f137a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Older people, well-being and participation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://about.brighton.ac.uk/sass/older-people-wellbeing-and-participation/resources/?PageId=25</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Age UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Age UK Brighton &amp; Hove</gtr:department><gtr:description>Older people, well-being and participation</gtr:description><gtr:id>E9582D22-499F-4F9A-90EF-CB1C1916B9DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has resulted in the production of filmed learning resources and handbook for social care practice with older people, conference presentations and publications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b955f604b955f618-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Age UK Brighton and Hove provided practitioner expertise, support and facilitation to the older people who took part in this project as members of the knowledge exchange team.

The research has directly impacted practitioners and practice developments in services for older people, with learning resources (co-designed with practitioners and older people) being used in professional education and training across the UK and in New Zealand. The innovative participatory methodology has both enhanced older people's participation locally and been adopted more widely by university-community research collaborators working to enhance older people's citizenship and well-being (e.g. in Netherlands). Research has directly informed policy concerning the older people's needs assessments by recognising the centrality of relationships to well-being in older age. Locally it has informed policy, as indicated in Brighton &amp;amp;Hove's Joint Strategic Needs Assessment, where sections on both 'Ageing well' and 'Older People- Social Care' make explicit reference to the importance of the well-being research and the centrality of relationships to well-being in older age.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>36FAD968-4464-4298-814F-8FE3AB084A24</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5458b0e20820c3.20934557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project did not involve new research as it was a Follow On project designed to apply existing research findings to practice. The research on which it was based was participatory research to explore what well-being means to older people and how it is generated. 



The FO project involved a knowledge exchange between researchers, social care practitioners from statutory and voluntary sectors and older people. The aim was to build understanding of how to involve older people in decision making in ways that can contribute to well-being. It was based on both findings and practice experience of working with older people as co-researchers. Some of the older people involved in the research were also involved in the knowledge exchange. Research findings highlighted the importance of relationships to well-being. Both findings and participatory research practice were considered through the lens of the ethic of care. Discussions within the working group led to the identification of three key issues as the focus for the development of learning resources based on this work. These were: adjusting to change, care and caring relationships and making difficult decisions. Working with a professional production company we produced scripted scenarios based on research findings that were performed by professional actors. Together with films of the research team discussing the project and experiences of working together, these have been used in creating six linked films and an accompanying handbook that can be used in learning and teaching for those working with older people. 



We are reflecting on the learning coming from the experience of working with older people and practitioners in this knowledge exchange process and are in the process of producing an analysis of this experience. As envisaged, the experience of working with a 'mixed' group was a different one from our experience of working with older people in the collaborative research on well-being. One impact was that some older people felt that they needed to draw more from former professional identities (some had worked in social care before retirement), than on their experiential knowledge of growing older. Practitioner members of the group experienced considerable benefit from close collaboration with older people and researchers over what for them was an extended period. They reported insights into the possibilities of working with older people that they would take into their practice. Both their responses and the feedback on learning resources received so far support the value of the ethic of care framework for practice with older people.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As above. Plus experiences and findings are being shared with older people and in contexts in which policy and service development focussed on older people's well-being is being pursued. One such example is in the context of Brighton and Hove's bid to become an age friendly city. Learning resources are being used in training social care practitioners in statutory and voluntary settings, as well as in university contexts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>87DAC309-04D7-491C-BF35-F9209F659E35</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6183461971.751844b2f381aa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.brighton.ac.uk/sass/older-people-wellbeing-and-participation/resources/?PageId=25</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>772F076E-6298-4258-90E5-882C3B84E3F9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transforming Practice with Older People through an Ethic of Care.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British journal of social work</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ee34b53ea1ff1b9e6475bc8d0444dfa8"><gtr:id>ee34b53ea1ff1b9e6475bc8d0444dfa8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ward L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0045-3102</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56c31c640e5563.91343086</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6561BD95-314F-4706-AD5D-6A6DB326EBBC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Being well enough in old age</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Critical Social Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9faee99e5b9bd5dae5d47afc3e57eb56"><gtr:id>9faee99e5b9bd5dae5d47afc3e57eb56</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barnes M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfa9fa961494a4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-189-25-0330</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J001058/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
