It will focus in particular on British writers of South Asian Muslim heritage, engaging substantially with debates and controversies concerning the place of Muslims in contemporary multicultural Britain, as well as with the historical presence and practices of Muslims in Britain from the early years of the twentieth century.\n\nSince the controversy sparked by Salman Rushdie's 1988 novel The Satanic Verses, British Muslims have been placed increasingly at the centre of tensions and urgent debate concerning multiculturalism by a series of events. These include the 1991 Gulf war; the July 2001 'race riots' in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham; the 9/11 attacks and 'war on terror' waged by Britain in Afghanistan and Iraq; and the 2005 bombings on London transport by British Muslim men. The research will demonstrate the dominance in political debate and national broadcast and broadsheet media of liberal constructions of this minority which represent 'culture' (encompassing religion) as the main factor in identity formation and the primary source of the perceived ills of the 'community', erasing or at best marginalising the social and cultural exclusion experienced by a significant proportion of British Muslims. In such constructions, Britain's male Muslim youth becomes hyper-masculinized through a discourse that identifies it with disaffection, criminality, violence and terror, and leaves little space for alternative subjectivities. In debate about forced marriage, 'honour killings' and the wearing of the hijab, Muslim women are frequently represented either as submissive to patriarchal religious culture or, conversely, as 'liberated' from it. Islam and Muslims have come to figure increasingly as secular modernity's fundamentalist 'other'.\n\nSouth Asian Muslim Britons have engaged with these events, controversies and discourses - not just in the media and the political sphere but also in the arts and fiction. The project will offer close readings of a selection of novels, short stories and autobiographical accounts by a number of authors including Tariq Mehmood, Salman Rushdie, Hanif Kureishi, Monica Ali, Nadeem Aslam, Sarfraz Manzoor, Ed Hussain, Yasmin Hai and Shelina Zahra Janmohamed. It will explore the ways in which the texts reproduce, debate or destabilize normative ideological constructions of British Muslim culture, and how they might inform current debates about contemporary multicultural Britain. These concern, for example, the place of religious faith within a largely secular public sphere; the intersection of class, gender and generation with religion in the formation of identities, affiliations and practices; and protests by Muslims against creative work and the questions they raise about the politics of representation. By focusing on the silences and contradictions of the primary texts, the study will shed light on social contradictions that are normatively obscured by ideology and demonstrate the centrality of the role of class in shaping Muslim minority identities and practices. It will thereby challenge liberal binaries of secularism, modernity and individual freedom versus religiosity, tradition and communal constraint, and advocate an understanding of multiculturalism and anti-racism which valorises subaltern formations and minority rights.\n\nWhile its primary focus is on the last 25 years, the project will also incorporate an exploration of the South Asian Muslim presence in Britain for the past 100 years in order to historicise their contemporary presence, practices and reception. Further, while its key concern is with Britain, the research will necessarily take in a wider, global context, incorporating discussion of how the writers have responded to events and debates relating to 'terror' and the 'war on terror' which have impacted profoundly on British Muslims.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond academia, my research project will benefit literary festivals (i.e., the Birmingham Book Festival) and the general reading public who attend them; creative arts organisations (i.e., Sampad and the Writers' Centre, Norwich) and the audiences of their events; the broadsheet press (i.e., the Guardian) and its readership; members of British Asian communities; and secondary schools, further education colleges and their pupils. All of these organisations or groups of people will benefit from the opportunity to engage with writing by Muslim authors and/or current debates concerning Muslims in Britain and/or evidence of the historical presence of Muslims in Britain. The introduction of 'British Muslim' writing into a literary event or school will diversify the programme or curriculum, bringing new stories and perspectives into these forums. It will also engage participants with topical debates via the literary voices of Muslims which have the potential to offer new, critical angles for considering current events and controversies. Evidence of the long historical presence of Muslims in Britain, showcased through the 'Making Britain' database (see below), will emphasise to members of British Asian communities as well as to the general British public the depth as well as the breadth of the Muslim contribution to British life, thereby challenging normative discourses that position Muslims on the margins of the nation. \n\nThese benefits will be ensured in the following ways: \n\n1. Building on previous collaboration with the Birmingham Book Festival and the South Asian arts organisation Sampad, I will lead a seminar on 'British Muslim' writing as well as a series of readings by 'British Muslim' writers at the 2010 Birmingham Book Festival. Existing connections with a number of authors through my 2004 anthology of British Asian short stories Walking a Tightrope will enable me to secure writers for such an event. \n\n2. I will propose to the Writers' Centre, Norwich, a series of workshops in schools and further education colleges. This organisation has substantial experience of liaising between writers and schools to orchestrate educational events. While pitched at a younger audience, the workshops will similarly comprise readings by writers of Muslim heritage and debate based around the questions and issues raised by the readings. This kind of workshop would fit well into the compulsory curriculum subjects of English or citizenship while introducing new material and providing alternative perspectives. \n\n3. I will propose a series of topical discussion pieces relating to my research project to the Guardian's online 'Comment is Free'. Examples of themes for these pieces include: the tension between artistic freedom and minority religious rights; the place of faith in the public sphere; and how current legislation responds to Islamophobia. This forum gives readers the opportunity to respond to and thus actively engage with the discussion pieces, thereby providing greater benefit to the reader than a conventional newspaper column. \n\n4. As Research Associate on the 3-year AHRC-funded project 'Making Britain: South Asian Visions of Home and Abroad, 1870-1950', I have contributed to the production of a fully searchable and interactive online database of several hundred entries on South Asian writers, artists and political activists in Britain between 1870 and 1950. While the database will be launched in September 2010, its authors will continue to create additional entries after this date. I plan to contribute a number of entries relating to South Asian Muslim individuals, organisations and events in Britain during the period in question, thereby drawing on the archival element of my proposed research. With a strong design and interactive features, this database will be fully accessible and attractive to the general public and therefore</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48062</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Writing from a Muslim Perspective: Selma Dabbagh, Aamer Hussein, Mirza Waheed (festival reading and discussion panel)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9701D391-6C82-408E-A985-71ABF4498395</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I convened and chaired this panel of writers of Muslim heritage for the Durham Book Festival 2012 in collaboration with New Writing North. The event featured three highly acclaimed writers: Selma Dabbagh, author of Out of It (Bloomsbury, 2011); Aamer Hussein, author of several short-story collections and, most recently, the novel The Cloud Messenger (Telegram, 2011); and Mirza Waheed, author of The Collaborator (Viking, 2011). Readings from the writers' work were followed by panel discussion then audience Q&amp;amp;A. Discussion focused on how the writers' cultural heritage informed their work, and on the role played by contemporary fiction in making sense of a world where Muslims are so often at the centre of political tensions, conflict and negative stereotype. The event increased the cultural diversity of the festival programme and enhanced intercultural understanding.

The event increased the cultural diversity of the festival programme and enhanced intercultural understanding. Rebecca Wilkie (Programme Manager, Festivals and Events; New Writing North) said this of the event: &amp;quot;Drawing upon Rehana's expertise to programme this event at the [Durham Book] festival, helped us to bring a range of new authors to the festival and hopefully allowed us to introduce their work to new readers as well as existing fans of their work. The event, which was for an audience of 30 people, sold-out very quickly, demonstrating the high-level of interest it generated in our festival visitors; anecdotal feedback from audience members was also positive. The popularity of this event means that New Writing North will certainly consider programming events with a similar theme in future.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1615178633.12287120c0ed18a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Beyond the Frame: Writing from Art with John Siddique (writing workshop)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2757F65B-4399-4ED7-8428-878375C9E9C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This writing workshop was held in collaboration with the Middlesbrough Literary Festival and mima (Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art).

It explores a number of literary controversies that followed the Rushdie affair: the disputes triggered by Monica Ali's novel Brick Lane and its filming (2003, 2006), the performance of Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti's play Bezhti at the Birmingham Rep (2004) and Sherry Jones's romantic novel The Jewel of Medina (2008), as well as English PEN's mobilisation against proposed incitement to religous hatred legislation. Highlighting the role of class and race in these disputes, the article breaks down the assumed binary between freedom of speech and a censorious religion, and interrogates the sacralisation of free speech that followed the Rushdie affair and that has re-emerged more recently with the New Atheist movement.

This article has been widely disseminated and, as a result, will have provoked thought and discussion about literary controversies and religious offence.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8265242230.394150c1ad5ca</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-claire-chambers/rushdie-muslims-books-controversy_b_1895954.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Muslims Protest Against H.

It looks backwards in time from the Satanic Verses controversy to a remarkable and little-known historical precedent dating from August 1938. Members of the Jamiat-ul-Muslimin, a London based organisation whose members were predominantly working-class South Asians, protested against H. G. Wells' A Short History of the World because of references to the Prophet Muhammad which they considered to be offensive. The article explores the protest and responses to it, and raises questions regarding freedom of speech, offence, faith, race and class which are especially pertinent today, in the wake of a number of high-profile controversies involving creative works and religious offence. As well as unsettling the perception that the Rushdie affair was the first in a series of challenges to creative freedom in Britain, this example adds historical depth and complexity to debates which have become increasingly polarised in public discourse.

My organisation of this performance - and the associated conference (recorded separately) - developed from the research I conducted during my AHRC-funded fellowship. Originally from Blackburn, Avaes began writing after 9/11 and the 2001 race riots in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham, and his work continues to explore multiculturalism in Britain.

Discussion after the event was very animated. It focused on current issues concerning British Muslims and multiculturalism.

Drawing on a range of written accounts - from fiction to oral histories to newspaper reports - it provided a window into the lives of ayahs and anarchists, sailors and seamstresses, and revealed how migrant East Enders lived, worked, worshipped, and mobilised for their rights as British citizens in this iconic space.

The exhibition toured to several public libraries in 2010-11. Keen for it to reach the North East, I organised the final leg of its tour, to Middlesbrough Central Library, as part of my fellowship. The exhibition, displayed in October and November 2011 to coincide with Black History Month, focused on a wide range of South Asian-British networks and interactions in the spheres of sport, the arts, domestic, cultural and intellectual life, resistance and activism, and national and global politics. By revealing the long presence of Asians in Britain, and their multifarious impact on British life, it unsettled perceptions of British Asians being newcomers to and on the margins of the nation. I gave a curator talk (25 October 2011) focusing in particular on the Muslim South Asian presence in Britain, to reflect the aims of my research fellowship and to engage the significant proportion of British Pakistanis in the town in particular. See below also.

The audience Q&amp;amp;A was lively, with several audience members offering information about the early twentieth century South Asian presence in Middlesbrough. As a result, I was able to add new data to the Making Britain Database, an output of the AHRC-funded project 'Making Britain: South Asian Visions of Home and Abroad, 1870-1950' (2007-10) (http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/). An audience questionnaire following my talk recorded comments including: &amp;quot;Very useful information&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Interesting snapshots of research&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;The website is going to be a good research source&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Very interesting and informative.

Prior to this, the service had only been able to promote the month with limited activities, such as displays and book lists, however Rehana's touring panel exhibition and talk, generated a lot of interest within the local community, and we know that people visited the library, specifically to see the display, and listen to the talk - some of whom had not previously visited the library.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5933608241.3174290bd8e976</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://marshtowers.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/making-britain.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wendy Meddour, Children's Author (author visit to primary schools)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>82AE0E09-2327-42CB-9C50-BB9893B03133</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I organised a mini-tour of Wendy Meddour, author and illustrator of children's fiction, to two primary schools in County Durham in association with the Durham Book Festival and New Writing North. Wendy Meddour is the author of A Hen in the Wardrobe and The Black Cat Detectives (Frances Lincoln, 2012), two books in the Cinammon Grove series which feature British Muslim families. Wendy visited South Hetton Primary School and Stanley Burnside Primary School, where the large majority of pupils are from majority white working-class backgrounds. She read from her books, and did various writing and drawing activities with the children who had researched the author and her books in advance of her visit. In a region with very little cultural diversity, the children's engagement with both the author and her fiction was significant for its ability to foster awareness and understanding of multiculturalism and Muslim culture - especially at a time when British Muslims have been subjected to distorting stereotypes in media and political discourses.

The teachers were incredibly enthusiastic about Wendy's visit. The children had read her books and done research about her. They asked lots of questions and were very interested in the Muslim cultures depicted in her fiction. Wendy Meddour said of her visit: &amp;quot;My trip to Durham - and the school visits organised by Rehana Ahmed - gave me a wonderful opportunity to meet (and enthuse) children from very deprived areas. Many of them had never met an author, and it was touching to experience their excitement. It was also great fun to help them realise their own creative potential. As it was a predominantly white area, the school visits were also an opportunity to introduce the children to the other cultures (largely Muslim) presented in my books (A Hen in the Wardrobe and The Black Cat Detectives). They responded extremely well and we had a lot of fun discussing characters, playing with plot and hopefully dismantling prejudice!&amp;quot; One of the children at Burnside School made the following comment in response to Wendy's visit: &amp;quot;I am very grateful that you could come and visit me and my friends at Burnside School. I was very excited to know that I was going to meet a real life author! I hope I can be an author like you one day.&amp;quot; (see: http://newwritingnorth.com/text_downloads/files/sponsorship_leaflet_jan_2013.pdf).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4447496835.5591380c11106c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.newwritingnorth.com/news_details-early-events-in-libraries-and-schools-for-durham-book-festival-details-2008.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Three Poets of Muslim Heritage: Moniza Alvi, John Siddique, Shamshad Khan (festival reading and discussion panel)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E6B7D4C3-FA22-4B2B-80F9-AF07BCD8B29D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event, which was part of the Middlesbrough Literary Festival 2012, brought together three very different and highly acclaimed poets of Muslim heritage: Moniza Alvi, John Siddique and Shamshad Khan. The poets performed their work - which explores themes as diverse as love, loss, belonging, war, race, multiculturalism, faith and migration - then participated in a chaired discussion and a Q&amp;amp;A session with the audience. The poets' work offered an interesting counterpoint to challenge some of the stereotypes that circulate about British Muslims, especially since the 2001 race riots in Bradford, Burnely and Oldham, 9/11, and 7/7. This is important in the context of Middlesbrough, home to a substantial South Asian Muslim population (Pakistanis form the town's largest minority group, currently estimated at around 4% of the population, a figure which is thought to be growing) and with a long history of South Asian Muslim immigration. Members of the audience were from both majority white backgrounds and minority Muslim and/or Asian backgrounds. Discussion focused on issues including the category of 'Muslim' writing, cultural and literary influences, the role that faith plays in the poets' work, and the impact of 9/11 and 7/7 on their poetry. The event enhanced intercultural dialogue and understanding, and encouraged audiences from minority ethnic backgrounds to access the arts.

The event initiated an ongoing collaboration between Teesside University and the Middlesbrough Literary Festival. I planned to convene a similar event, dedicated to work by writers of Muslim or other minority ethnic background, each year, in order to enhance the festival's diversity. Because of my institutional move (to Queen Mary University of London), I was unable to do this - but I am hopeful it will happen in my absence.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2215405462.510330c0f1e38</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.visitmiddlesbrough.com/whats-on/event/319/three-british-poets-of-muslim-heritage</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Please see under 'Key Findings' - 'In what ways might your findings be taken forward or put to use by others': 

Events at two literary festivals in the North East - the Middlesbrough Literary Festival and the Durham Book Festival - engaged members of the public with the work of poets and novelists of Muslim heritage and enabled them to participate in debate triggered by the writers' work. The touring of a children's author to two schools in County Durham gave schoolchildren the opportuntiy to read fiction featuring British Muslim characters and engage in discussion about Muslim cultures with the author. Two co-authored articles on British Muslims and literary controversies in the online Huffington Post brought core aspects of the research into the public domain. Eight additional entries on Muslims in Britain for an online database, as well as a talk at Middlesbrough Central Library on the early, pre-Second World War presence of South Asians in Britain, and a public walk focusing on the shared historical presence of Muslim and Jewish communities in Whitechapel, east London, enhanced public knowledge of the historical depth of Muslim and South Asian contributions to British life. The introduction of 'British Muslim' writing into literary festivals and schools diversified their programmes or curricula, bringing new stories and perspectives into these forums. The literary voices of Muslims offered new, critical angles for considering current events and controversies whose representations in the media so often construct Muslim communities as problems to be solved. Evidence of the long historical presence of Muslims in Britain, showcased through the 'Making Britain' database, emphasised to members of British Muslim and British Asian communities as well as to the general British public the depth as well as the breadth of the Muslim contribution to British life, thereby challenging discourses that position Muslims on the margins of the nation. In short, these outputs, some of which will be ongoing or annual events, helped to enhance intercultural understanding, thereby impacting positively on society.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>44307F72-404F-419D-AB40-51B778909625</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d370132bdae3.56986726</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project explored contemporary literary representations of Muslim cultures and identities, with a particular focus on British writers of South Asian Muslim heritage. It engaged closely with debates and controversies concerning the place of Muslims in contemporary multicultural Britain, as well as illuminating the historical presence and practices of Muslims in Britain over the last one hundred years. 



The adoption of an interdisciplinary and materialist approach to the literary texts, which drew on sociology, social geography and cultural anthropology as well as Marxist literary theory, highlighted the significance of class in shaping British Muslim identities and multicultural politics. An emphasis on the centrality of class when exploring the texts and their contexts exposed the limits of a liberal multiculturalism which individualizes and equalizes subjects belonging to different religious or ethnic groups, and enabled a deconstruction of the polarisation of secularism, modernity and individual freedom versus religiosity, tradition and communal constraint. This in turn helped to challenge constructions of British Muslim communities as oppressive and illiberal, and, drawing on the work of Tariq Modood, enabled an approach to multiculturalism which recognizes subaltern formations and rethinks multicultural equality in terms of a positive accommodation of difference in the public sphere rather than in terms of individualism and cultural assimilation. 



A key focus of the project was on literary controversies, in particular those surrounding Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses (1988) and Monica Ali's Brick Lane (2003). The project revealed the importance of reading literary controversies alongside and against the texts that trigger them, demonstrating how such a reading practice can productively illuminate tensions and complexities both in the textual representations of multicultural Britain and in multicultural Britain itself. A focus on the reception of the texts - both by the communities they engage with and by the literary establishment - revealed the differences in cultural and economic capital that underpin these differing responses, thereby breaking down the binary of secular free speech versus religious censure and censorship. An exploration of a much earlier controversy - a 1938 protest by members of the working-class London-based Jamiat-ul-Muslimin against H. G. Wells' A Short History of the World - enabled a historicisation of contemporary disputes. This, alongside other historical material, emphasised the significance of the role of class as well as faith for Muslims in early twentieth century Britain, unsettling contemporary claims about multiculturalism and its 'failure'.



Another key concern of the project was gender, in particular the identification of male Muslim youth with disaffection, criminality, violence and terror, and representation of Muslim women either as submissive to patriarchal religious culture or, conversely, as 'liberated' from it. Close examination of the literary texts revealed both the presence and the disturbance of such discourses, as well as, in some cases, a tension between feminism and multiculturalism which illuminated the presence of this tension in the social sphere, where feminism and multiculturalism are often represented as antithetical (e.g. in discussion of so-called 'honour crimes', forced marriages, veiling practices, and so on).



In summary, the project highlighted the importance of a focus on literary and other cultural texts for an exploration of debates and issues concerning Muslims and multiculturalism. It revealed how the contradictions and complexities of literary texts can advance our understanding and potentially open up ways of understanding these issues that push beyond stereotypes and conventional discourses and frameworks for thinking about them.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Several project outputs sought to engage the general public with the research and its findings.
