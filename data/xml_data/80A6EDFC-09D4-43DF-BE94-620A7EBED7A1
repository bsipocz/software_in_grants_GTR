During the same period around 27,000 disappearances occurred, and approximately 15,000 bodies remain unidentified, as there are no national databases in the country. In Mexico, distrust in governmental authorities is the norm, since the practice of forensic science has been opaque, and has sometimes been used to cover the tracks of the perpetrators of grave crimes. The inimical response of the government to this humanitarian crisis, has repeatedly shown that the problem is not one that can simply be solved by the construction or strengthening of forensic technical capacities, but rather the absence of due investigation and diligence that is related to the existing ties between public institutions and organised crime, as well as other normalised practices of corruption.

Our project will explore new forms of citizenship related to the use of forensic science in the search for the missing in Mexico, and will also provide invaluable insights into the disruptive dimensions of Forensic Science and DNA profiling. Through Participatory Action Research (PAR), we wish to explore what would happen if forensic techniques (including DNA) were to be placed in the hands of the relatives of the disappeared, or in non-governmental forensic experts, and/or in interested citizens in Mexico. The project aims to create the first citizen-led Forensic DNA database as a way of positively intervening in the humanitarian crisis currently lived in Mexico.The citizen-led Forensic database will be designed as a mobile and PAR device, articulated through civil society organisations of relatives of the disappeared, already partnered with the project. The project will make DNA swab kits available for 1,500 people (approx. 500 Mexican families), accompanied by a clear set of instructions on how to collect DNA from cheek swabbing, as well as from the personal belongings of the missing person. In the same DNA Kit we would ask the participating families to include written accounts of their case, their experience with forensic investigations (if any), and personal narratives of what they have gone through since their relative(s) disappeared.

Academic literature, mostly centred in EU and the US, solely links the use of forensic databases with state surveillance and issues of privacy. In this project we aim to move the debate beyond these common tropes to explore how citizen-led forensic databases can become a tool for reparation and truth finding. Our project breaks with traditional (state-centric) ways of researching about violence and disappearance, since it surpasses the boundaries between victims' claims for justice and the experts in charge of providing 'truth' about the missing. It is also innovative as it brings together biogenetic and social research; thus providing a tool to open novel avenues of academic inquiry, as well as grounded insights for humanitarian and political intervention. Regardless if our citizen-led forensic project succeeds or fails, our research has the potential to have a truly transformative and global impact, considering the fact that we can help to provide new pathways for forensic research and intervention, in the mass atrocities of today and of the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Local and international non-governmental organisations constituted by relatives of the disappeared in Latin America will certainly be interested in our research. Our activities will be of relevance for all those agencies and groups that are interested in aiding and understanding the scientific and social processes of forensic identification in post-disaster and complex violence scenarios.
These users will benefit from our activities in two ways: first, through engagement in our meetings and workshops, where their views and concerns will be constantly included in an ongoing research design and execution. Second, through the bilingual (English/Spanish) project web pages that will include summaries of our research findings, useful links and debate forums on the progress of the citizen-led DNA database. This information could be used to address questions of forensic interest in the search for truth and justice, as well as informative resources for relevant policymakers. The various NGOs collaborating with our research efforts, such as NAR (Nuestra Aparente Rendici&amp;oacute;n), which tracks the death toll in Mexico, and organisations of relatives of the disappeared such as Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa, FUNDEM, FUUNDEC, NAR, CADHAC,and Movimento por la Justicia y Dignidad, will be directly involved and benefitted by the citizen-led forensic database and the research project. The PI has already secured agreements for cooperating with a number of NGOs dealing with the question of violence and disappearance in Mexico, in order to build the citizen-led biobank for victim identification. 
Governments and international specialist agencies such as the International Commission of Missing Persons (ICMP), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Europe-Aid, US-Aid, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, will also benefit from our independent exploration of forensic science, the experiment to create a citizen-led DNA and case database, as well as its impact on the delivery oftruth and reparation for the victims of violence.
The media (especially science-oriented media), that have a direct interest in educating and exploring the public impact of science in the identification of victims, are likely to be interested in our research findings. The same applies to forensic investigators (e.g. Mexican Institutes of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences), who have interests in links between genetics law and the public. Our aim in communicating with these target audiences is to raise the profile of the project and to feed into debates about how forensic science might relate to notions of reparation and truth finding regarding the identification of missing persons. We seek to raise awareness of the ways science can shape ideas about these matters and to serve as an observatory of scientific, legal and forensic practice in victim identification and nation building processes in Mexico and Colombia.
Our strategy to assure that we can make the most of our project, is to create a free access executive summary of our main findings to be distributed in social networks, policy making institutes and in our bilingual webpage through electronic means. In addition, a wide variety of people will be invited to these open sessions, press releases will also be prepared prior to the workshops and, whenever possible, team members will seek to publish brief pieces, interviews, etc. in local media outlets. We plan to design a specific section of our project website in which key documents that contain useful and theoretical information will be available; for example, summaries of findings, discussions of relevant themes, useful resources and links, etc.The strategic direction of impact is the responsibility of the PI and the COI, but the project workshops, planning meetings, and executive summaries will also be facilitated by the hired Staff in the local contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>198143</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A brief history of the way in which forensics and citizens have fought repressive governments and organised crime in Latin America in their search for truth.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D7EDACCF-D30E-49BD-9A56-007CF1815B5D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I still don't know if this has any wider impact in policy of practice, but has been widely distributed by NGOS and the people participating in Citizen-Led Forensics</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16f5bd40629.02433674</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>A history of Disappearance in 3 act</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGrXTyrdDck&amp;feature=youtu.be</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A song based on the experiences of the relatives of disappeared persons in Mexico.</gtr:description><gtr:id>281BD56B-87FB-4D67-8846-6A3B1B2FE5D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The song was downloaded more than 750 times the first month, since it was released and has become the anthem for many organisations looking for their disappeared relatives in Mexico.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16e3a01d959.65235636</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Promise: A song for the disappeared</gtr:title><gtr:type>Composition/Score</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://cienciaforenseciudadana.org/escucha-la-cancion-promesa/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>It is a didactic video explaining why it is important to take your own DNA sample and participate in Citizen-Led Forensics</gtr:description><gtr:id>57002B64-A829-4589-AE10-7DE538FDE5AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It taught hundred of relatives of disappeared persons how to take their own DNA sample to build an independent forensic biobank</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e17057ed4a06.36419145</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Didactic videos to learn how to collect your own DNA sample</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cienciaforenseciudadana.org/video-galeria</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>It was the video that explained the motives, funding and purposes of Citizen-Led Forensics</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E373063-0554-4055-8444-AA1E4B8AD641</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It was a tool for the people that invested resources and time in our project to convince other relatives of the disappeared to participate and collaborate in the creation of the forensic database and DNA repository, available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljQvB14nISg</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e17213280445.92812412</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Introduction and explanation of Citizen-Led Forensics</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Metropolitan Autonomous University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Mexico, United Mexican States</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration Agreement with UAM Xochimilco</gtr:description><gtr:id>D79EB84B-484C-4907-8D24-02102021F59E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A description of the events and conferences is available in their webpage as well as a report on the</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e15fc8e8cc52.71755792-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>They provided transport, infrastructure, printing costs and installations to conduct the event.

I directed a team of 5 researchers, and together with relatives of the disappeared in Mexico, we formed a pioneering citizen-led organisation in charge of governing and managing DNA samples and a forensic database. My research has attracted vast public attention since Mexicans are currently dealing with more than 27,000 disappearances in a context characterised by the complicity of authorities and organised crime; evidenced by the 869 families registered in our database, and the 440 DNA collection kits that have been distributed all around Mexico. The 123 media pieces covering our project around the world through the BBC, Al Jazeera, and CNN (amongst others), provide an audio- visual testimony of the momentum our participatory action research activities gained in 2014-15: for a brief example watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj2JS5kamQk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be. The impact of my work is shown by its influence in shaping legislation in the Mexican congress, but it is also evidenced by the hundreds of families of the disappeared that are still making their forensic DNA database grow each month despite the fact that the project ended a year ago. NGOS are now opening new technologies spheres of independent citizen-science such as drone flights to look for mass graves, as well as new grass root techniques to locate bodies, on top of this the grass root organisation in our project are now making deal with the Mexican state to compare their databases.

 The first Citizen-Led Exhumation, The Case of Brenda Damaris Solis in Monterrey Nuevo Leon- a snapshot of one of our participatory research highlights :

 The recurrent narrative of the authorities in Mexico - reported to us via the relatives of the disappeared - criminalises the disappeared: 'if something happened to him/her, they must had been involved in something' or 'who knows who they were working with?' Our interviews repeatedly reveal cases in which the abuse of authority - commonly in the form of relatives being asked for briberies in order to be told basic things about the their loved one's case (something that is already part of their legal rights) or to examine evidence - is the norm. For example, Juany (mother) and the Solis family had been looking for Brenda Damaris Solis (daughter) for more than two years following a car accident. The car was left on the side of the road and, although it presented various bullet holes, no blood or other biological samples were visible, and the only trace that human bodies were once riding the car was a bump on the front window. The lack of both evidence and information led the family to believe there was something suspicious about the case. Desperate and looking for answers, Juany threw herself into a hunt for information regarding her daughter, and when visiting the mass grave the federal police almost put her and the Solis family in jail; a er keeping them captive for some hours she was warned not to snoop in mass graves, but a week later she was handed the human remains of her daughter. However, Brenda had disappeared just three months ago, and the skeletal remains that appeared in the le had no so tissue and, according to the pathologist, instead corresponded to the traits of someone nine to twelve months dead. 

On 10 September 2014, Juany and a group of activists, journalists and fellow relatives of disappeared persons were witnesses to the exhumation of what the Mexican State and the Nuevo Leon Government claimed were the human remains of Brenda Damaris Solis. In light of such events, a communication campaign was produced by FUNDENL, one of the most important CSOs comprising relatives of the disappeared.The Solis family - with the help of other mothers and Letty 'Roy Rivera' Hidalgo, the leader of FUNDENL - devised a plan to break the Mexican State's monopoly over forensic knowledge and the governance of human remains. Using a legal figure contained in the new law that each family would be allowed access to independent peritos (forensic experts) if they pay the costs themselves. FUNDENL organised a high profile event with media personnel, forensic experts (independent teams from Peru and Mexico) and professionals coming from the Mexican NGO Gobernanza Forense Ciudadana and the ESRC funded project 'Citizen-Led Forensics', to create a new type of forum: the country's first structure for citizen led exhumations, as well as the first case of an independent forensic DNA database in Mexico - governed, created and managed by relatives of the disappeared. Sadly, a couple of months afterward the DNA results confirmed Brenda was dead, however since it seems that police men killed her, and there is no will from authorities to search for them, and bring them to justice, the Solis family is now in a journey, accompanied them by other relatives of the disappeared, searching for justice and trying to make those responsible to pay for the crimes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AE0C8120-AFE8-4005-B233-CEDF7F42A5E0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dfa4e6807a73.76494457</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>It is possible and desirable to innovate in the field of forensics and citizen science, however the governance mechanisms need to be strengthen to allow for radical participation as well as sustainability, amidst a scenarios that does not favor and even combat, efforts to improve transparency and strengthen citizen participation.

Nowadays they are lobbying a law to regulate forensic biobank in Mexico, including their own which is the only forensic database and DNA biobank governed by the relatives of the disappeared.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16d56cd5f54.44866307</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>It is a database created by the relatives of the disappeared with basic forensic data, economic data related to disappearance and also includes the perpetrators of crime if known by the relatives of the disappeared.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D2D70AFF-7C4A-4DF5-84EB-116FE29A4D2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It has been used to produce descriptive statistics used by the victims of warfare to better understand and gain and independent knowledge about the disappeared in Mexico.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e172fa676958.77160891</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Citizen Led registry  of the disappeared</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://apps.dur.ac.uk/esrc/index.php?p=0</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6D583BDD-AEB3-4373-A956-8C243DC75278</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pure Corpses, Dangerous Citizens: transgressing the boundaries between mourners and experts in the search for the disappeared in Mexico.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Research: International Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b66bce44d181e48ea4015f29b437c2e2"><gtr:id>b66bce44d181e48ea4015f29b437c2e2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schwartz-Marin Ernesto</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56dfa2992f73c8.76695661</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD8866F6-4316-4BD6-B5B3-3192AF2FB8C8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Forensic Civism: Articulating Science, DNA and Kinship in Mexico and Colombia</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Human  Remains and Violence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b66bce44d181e48ea4015f29b437c2e2"><gtr:id>b66bce44d181e48ea4015f29b437c2e2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schwartz-Marin Ernesto</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56dffcecdcd914.96066070</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M00063X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04B7A494-75A7-4241-9AA9-A7791BD4328A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic &amp; Latin American Stud</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
