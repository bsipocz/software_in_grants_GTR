But it was a bumpy ride. The emperors were ready to give considerable wealth and power to the leaders of the true church; but how, when the Christian communities were so riven with factions, could one tell which church, or which of its leaders, was true? \n\nThe bitter theological debates of the fourth century we know as the Arian controversy result in part, at least, from the emperors' forcing of issues which in earlier days bishops might have been left to gnash their teeth over in impotence. But however disedifying we might today find their squabbles, the Christians of the fourth century did do a lot of important work in clarifying what could and should be said about Christ. \n\nIs it work we want to stick by, though? One of the great tasks of the ancient historian (including the church historian) is to think the thoughts of the past again. But having thought them, many modern scholars have concluded the fourth-century Church came up with the wrong answer. Arius should have won the Arian controversy, with his doctrine of a Son who was not like the Father, but like us: an ancient hero, not an utterly transcendent God. This is certainly a doctrine tacitly embraced by many Christians today. Arius the heretic should really be a saint.\n\nSuch has been the thrust of at least one strand of the English-speaking scholarship of the Arian Controversy over the last twenty-five years. Others have fiercely opposed it, often from a Roman Catholic or an Orthodox perspective. But all parties seem agreed on one villain: Marcellus of Ancyra, at whose see the Council of Nicaea was originally scheduled to be held, who attacked the supporters of Arius at Nicaea, and wrote against them in the years that followed, only to be deposed in his turn for supposedly teaching that 'the Word first had a beginning from Mary'. He did indeed teach this, of course, because he taught that the Word was eternal.\n\nMarcellus, for all his importance, is very under-studied in the English-speaking world. There is currently no published English translation of his works, for instance. As a result, he is known by students, and even by more established scholars, entirely through the eyes of the following generation of theologians, particularly Basil the Great, who abominated him. Even those who look to the original Greek find first of all the Greek of Eusebius of Caesaera, in whose anti-Marcellan writings the fragments are embedded. Eusebius' Marcellus, like Athanasius' Arius, is mad, bad, and dangerous to know. Even some of the most important recent works on Marcellus, Joseph Lienhard's Contra Marcellum and Markus Vinzent's edition of the fragments, are still to some extent bound by the anti-Marcellan tradition.\n\nMarcellus deserves a serious, deep attempt to reconstuct his text and present what he was actually trying to say, not what Eusebius wished us to think he was saying. I want to make Marcellus' authentic voice accessible to undergraduates and those with a general interest in the history of doctrine, who know Marcellus only as the heretic who taught that Christ's Kingdom would have an end. Marcellus' theology- and above all, his exegesis- is sometimes strange, but it is fresh and alive. It has striking parallels at times with the thought of Thomas Aquinas, for example. More study of Marcellus' own words and a serious attempt to think his thoughts after him would show us that the old doctrinal disputes we believe we know so well are richer than we think, even after all the work that has been done. A serious, full edition, using the best of the new scholarship to establish the text, but also making available some of Marcellus' liveliness and wit in an accessible translation, would forever change the way we see the Arian controversy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23689</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F015097/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FED118D3-C8D1-42BF-829F-C2CD1390FF49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>61B990B8-E8CF-4876-B8AE-E00F07CCE8C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Church &amp; Theology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B3A6F504-CFE6-4113-BBAE-292550B98DEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy, Thought &amp; Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
