I began work on this book six years ago, with the intention of writing a succinct synthesis on the period, one in which I would make a modest historiographical contribution by trying to assert the importance of grassroots politics. But over time, as my research deepened, and as more and more scholars began to write about the same period, two things became apparent: first, that most scholars' tendency to emphasize national political trends was producing a skewed interpretation of the period; second (and related), that although some issues - particularly the so-called 'culture wars' - had been well-covered by scholars, many other issues and movements had been almost entirely overlooked. As a result, the book's scope grew and deepened. It is now a much more ambitious project aimed at completely overturning the prevailing interpretations of post-1960s American history. \n\nTo date, I have written drafts of the first seven chapters - more than 400 typescript pages. In the last year, my progress has stalled, mostly owing to my (and my family's) move from New York to Sheffield, and adjusting to a new job and a new country. Therefore, this application seeks support to buy the time I need to write the last two chapters of the book, revise the entire manuscript (in coordination with my editor and other scholars), and to research and acquire the rights to reprint the photographs that will accompany the text. At a 60% buy-out, I will be able to keep my commitment to teach my special subject (one of only two to be offered in American history at Sheffield next year), and still be able to complete the book by the end of the 2010-2011 academic year. \n\nIn all of the most influential monographs on the period, post-1960s America is presented as a bland sequel to two decades in which the nation experienced tremendous social upheaval. The tumult arising from the civil rights movement, the student movement, countercultural challenges, the women's liberation movement, and the impassioned debate and demonstrations over the Vietnam War were, we are told, replaced with a new post-Vietnam consensus. Richard Nixon's 'great silent majority' rejected the liberalism and radicalism of the 1960s, moved to the right politically - leading, ultimately, to the 'Reagan Revolution' - and simultaneously turned inward, away from civic engagement and social protest. \n\nChallenging the conventional view that Americans were passive in this period, Life during Wartime examines how citizenship was exercised and reconfigured. Alert to discontinuities between local and national trends, it probes the ways in which politically engaged Americans shaped an era of dynamic grassroots activism, in order to present a more nuanced and accurate account of US political culture from 1970 to the 1990s. By the end of the 1960s, an ethos of organized protest pervaded American society to such an extent that people of all political persuasions took to grassroots organizing. The key factor, I argue, is that in harsh economic times, Americans mobilized at the grassroots in defense of home and family. I call this 'front porch politics.' That is, as Americans looked at their country and their lives from the vantage point of their own front porches (or, in the city, from their front stoops), they saw threats to their individual and family security. Regardless of the cause - the economically-driven withdrawal of services, busing children to force integration, calls for and against equal rights for women and gays, the loss of jobs and farms, toxic waste discoveries, etc.- Americans mobilized in communities large and small, from one end of the country to the other to defend themselves and their families. This may not have been the 'Sixties' activism, but, in some ways, the 1970s and 1980s were more like &amp;quot;the Sixties&amp;quot; than were the 1960s themselves.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Life during Wartime will not only aim to engage scholars across multiple disciplines; as a monograph written for a trade press, it will be aimed at a much wider public audience. To that end, the publisher, Hill &amp;amp; Wang, will organize a book tour in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition, I will give public lectures organized by both the Centre for Peace History (of which I am co-director) and the new Centre for Democratic Cultures. In addition, through other contacts in the UK, I plan to give lectures in other parts of the country beyond Sheffield. \n\nBeyond these traditional book promotion efforts, I am negotiating with the Showroom Cinema in Sheffield to host a 1970s-1980s film series that will either show American films related to some of the political issues raised in the book or pair American and British films according to some of those same themes. I will give opening remarks and lead a question and answer session at selected viewings, with the idea that if the series is successful, Showroom may run the series at some of its cinemas elsewhere in the UK. If we are able to agree on a US-UK film series, the point would be to demonstrate both similarities and differences in the American and British political experience in this period. Some of the films under consideration are:\n\nNetwork (on cynical political mood)\nHarlan County, USA (on battles over labor unions)\nNorma Rae (on labor and feminism)\nThe Times of Harvey Milk (on gay rights)\nThe China Syndrome (on battles over nuclear energy)\nCountry (on 1980s farm crisis)\n9 to 5 (on feminism)\nWhen We Were Kings (on race)\n\nIn addition, my long-term hope is to produce a documentary series on America in the 1970s and 1980s, based on Life during Wartime. I have some experience in this area, having served as historical advisor on the award-winning film, The Camden 28 (First Run Films, 2007), directed by Anthony Giacchino. There are never guarantees in bringing the substance of a book to film or television, but given the relevance of the subject matter to today's political scene and the growing fascination with the 1970s and 1980s, it is a reasonable and realistic goal. \n\nThe most likely beneficiaries outside of academia are American citizens interested in how the political process works at the grassroots or in how the current United States political landscape was shaped in the 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, however, other beneficiaries would include British citizens. The similarities between the American and British experience in the 1970s and 1980s are not insignificant. Moreover, in a country where American current affairs and policy are followed so closely, an understanding of how American life is today shaped so much by the historical forces at play a generation ago is important . British and other international policymakers may also find much that is useful in the book, particularly as they need to understand the wider American political culture and its effect on the White House.\n\nTo reach that British audience, I plan to write an essay for possible publication in the BBC's History Magazine or perhaps produce a radio series for BBC Radio 4. \n\nFinally, given the encouragement we are getting at the moment about Knowledge Transfer, I plan to apply for funding to hold a series of grassroots activist workshops at which American and British organizers of various campaigns could meet and share strategies. The workshops would be organized around a particular theme (e.g., antinuclear; civil rights, etc.), and panels held for activists from both countries to relate their experiences working on the same issues. Historians, including those whose work informs my own, will serve as keynote speakers - each charged with relating the lessons of their work to an audience of activists.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41813</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I001328/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
