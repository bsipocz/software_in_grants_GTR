Life in Britain, c.1900-2000</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/H039864/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In 2009 the majority of Britons are fortunate to live their lives in relative safety - relative to other countries, and relative to the past. Despite this, many people perceive danger all around - whether from the threat of crime and terrorism, or from the risk of a road traffic accident or occupational injury. One of the techniques used to minimise danger is safety education, in which the media convey messages that try to persuade people to change their behaviour and adopt 'safe' habits. We see safety education every Christmas, for example, with the anti-drink/driving campaign on TV and radio, in cinemas, on posters and in newspapers. Social commentators complain that these campaigns represent the extension of the 'nanny state.' Yet, for all that it surrounds us everyday, no-one has stopped to examine the origins of safety education in Britain. This project does just that.\n\nIt explores how and why safety education started, and what techniques were employed to prevent accidents. Rather than the characteristically Victorian approach of stern warnings, using dense text and unfamiliar language, early in the twentieth century a new method was adopted: visually attractive, using photographs to show people what to and what not to do, it also used a friendly, persuasive tone of address. Accordingly, this project makes use of a range of appealing sources: films, posters, leaflets, booklets, badges, games, cigarette cards, and more. One of the aims of the project is to analyse how messages have been conveyed, something of particular importance given the continued use of safety education in today's Britain. It also sheds light on the role of the government in producing advisory messages for its citizens. This research will show how the state extended its influence into virtually all areas of life for many - if not all - people during the twentieth century.\n\nThe project concentrates on three areas: work safety, public safety, and home safety. For each, detailed case studies will be carried out to address the general issues noted above. Safety education started and was shaped in the workplace, so it is here that it took on characteristics now familiar to us all: the research will examine why employers tried to improve worker safety by using posters, films, pamphlets and the like (such as the Great Western Railway's 1914 'Safety Movement' booklet or the National Coal Board's 1978 'Do it the safety way' record, sung by Max Bygraves). By looking at public safety - specifically road safety - it will be possible to see how and why safety education reached audiences outside the workplace. This part of the research will draw on material such as the 'Tufty' and 'Green Cross Code' campaigns; it will explore how safety and safety education started to become part of everyday life. Finally, examining safety education intended for use at home (such as the 1962 'Safety in your Home' booklet) will show the extent to which the state tried to influence the most private areas of peoples' lives, and how there came to be no hiding place from safety education.\n\nThrough articles in the local and national press, media interviews and public lectures this research will make the origins of contemporary safety culture widely known. It will provide critical historical perspective on 'health and safety gone mad' stories, whilst enhancing people's ability to decode safety education's messages. Consultations with policy-makers and safety professionals (for example, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) will raise awareness of past efforts and might suggest new approaches to improving safety. In the longer-term, there will be a public exhibition on the history of safety education; and it is hoped that the insights from this project will produce a larger, international collaborative research programme on the history of safety, stretching back earlier than the twentieth century, and involving specialists from disciplines beyond history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>* Who will benefit from this research?\nBeyond the academic beneficiaries and outputs, this project will have significant impact on two broad groups: the public and professionals/ policy-makers.\n\nAs virtually everyone has encountered safety education at some point in their daily life, research examining the origins of this phenomenon will attract public interest. The Impact Plan outlines in greater detail how I will ensure that public interest is generated and realised.\n\nOrganisations responsible for safety policy and producing safety education will also be interested in this research. This includes state bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Central Office of Information, and quasi-autonomous bodies such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), and the British Safety Council (BSC). Again, the Impact Plan provides further detail.\n\n\n* How will they benefit from this research?\nTo the public, this research will explain the origins of contemporary safety culture. It will provide historical perspective and allow the public to come to an informed and critical perspective on 'health and safety gone mad' stories, whilst enhancing their ability to decode safety education's messages.\n\nFor professionals and policy-makers this research will add historical perspective that is often lacking. Although safety (and health) education has now been deployed in Britain for nearly 100 years, amongst professionals and policy-makers very little is known about educative efforts before the last twenty or thirty years. My findings will offer an opportunity to extend critically this limited institutional memory and to contribute to a longer-term assessment of the validity and success of educative techniques. This is particularly important in relation to the project's exploration of the ways in which the state interacts with its citizens. At the introduction of new educative techniques it is commonplace to hear comments about the 'nanny state' - despite the fact that education is advisory and the state (in general) cannot force people to follow it. My research allows insight into this trend and could offer alternative techniques for producing educative material palatable to the target audiences.\n\n\n* What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research?\n- I will seek dialogue with policy-makers (for example the HSE) and organisations producing safety education (for example, RoSPA and the BSC), providing expert comment on safety and safety education\n- To reach as many policy-makers as possible, I will work with the History and Policy network, an organisation connecting historians and policy-makers\n- Through an exhibition, I will communicate my findings with a general audience. I have discussed staging an exhibition in 2013 with the National Railway Museum, to mark the 100th anniversary of the introduction of safety education in Britain, and am preparing the second stage of the proposal\n- I will approach national and local newspapers, offering illustrated features emphasising those aspects of my research that are most relevant to the readerships\n- I will seek opportunities to present my findings to lay audiences in person (for example, through local history groups)\n- I will publish my findings in the newsletters and journals of these lay groups\n- I will seek opportunities to discuss my findings with professional audiences (for example, IOSH or the BSC, with whom I have established relationships)\n- I will present my findings in the publications of these professional groups\n- Through Oxford Brookes' press office, I will provide press releases when my research yields findings and conclusions\n- I will add my details to Oxford Brookes' consultancy list, ensuring availability for comment\n- I will take advice from the Centre for Hea</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60780</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of New England</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Interaction with Jennifer Clark</gtr:description><gtr:id>6F5BCA3D-37E1-4F7A-AC97-AAA68C6A1531</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95917e4b9591802-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Following publicity for the 'Road Safety in History' symposium (detailed elsewhere), I was contacted by Dr Jennifer Clark (University of New England, Australia) as she was unable to attend the symposium.

I have had a number of meetings with Safety Improvement Specialists within Network Rail, to discuss future collaboration and to work on marking the 100th anniversary. This has involved discussion of my research and exploration of past safety initiatives and materials in relation to contemporary safety needs. 



This has led to my contribution to the Network Rail stand at the STEAM museum (detailed elsewhere on ROS) and my ongoing work with Network Rail to produce a new safety campaign, informed by past initiatives (currently 'in progress' on ROS).



The AHRC has been credited throughout.



Comments from one of Network Rail's Safety Improvement Specialists support the impact that my research has had. According to Becky Ray (10/10/13), my contributions to Network Rail's work on the 100th anniversary were 'invaluable': 'We were grateful that your research and knowledge into this topic has helped us run and exhibit a successful project as well as combining aspects of it with our overall Safety message to achieve a holistic approach.' She continued: 'I have been actively sending the resources we have produced out to the wider business and our Supply chain and I have had nothing but great feedback', and ends: 'this has a great impact on our safety community.'</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Railway Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>'Railway Work, Life &amp;amp; Death' crowd-sourcing project</gtr:description><gtr:id>DBB1B96B-6ED8-49C1-B3BA-1856EECBB0FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As the project is still in the data entry phase, there have been no formal outputs as yet.

I invited Roger to my public lecture (December 2011, detailed elsewhere), which he attended (and described as 'really excellent', and asked me to let him know when the Podcast was available). 



He subsequently invited me to attend the February meeting of the National Occupational Safety and Health Committee of RoSPA, a valuable link into the world of policy/ practice. He has also asked me to join the History of Safety and Health Working Group, a national group currently being formed to make the history of safety and health at work more visible and more easily accessible to practitioners and the public. I am continuing to work with this group, and with Roger, in order to bring project findings to the widest possible audience, and will look for ways to collaborate with RoSPA in the future.



In addition, I invited Roger to represent RoSPA in the concluding 'History &amp;amp; Policy' roundtable at the September 2013 'Accidents and Emergencies' conference. This session brought together practitioners, policy-makers and academics to explore the value of history in informing current debates. Roger was unable to attend, but David Eves (former HSE, now working with RoSPA) attended in his place.

Although this application was unsuccessful, it was valuable in bringing me into greater contact with practitioners and in helping me to consider how to bring historical insight to bear on contemporary problems.

At this meeting, Oliver Carsten (a member of PACTS, and Professor of Transport Safety at the Institute of Transport Studies, University of Leeds) also participated. I believe the exchange was useful for all concerned ? I was able to provide an historical perspective to some contemporary problems, and I was given a much greater insight into the ways in which contemporary transport safety issues are being examined and dealt with. 



Robert Gifford suggested that I put together a position paper, drawing on some of the things we discussed, and when this was done, I come to a PACTS members meeting to discuss with a wider, practice-based, audience. Although I have yet to do this, I will be putting a position paper together in the future.

As a result, the establishment of an H-Net Group dedicated to the history of safety and risk was suggested; since then I have been working with the editors (particularly Dr Amy Gangloff) and advisory board to develop the Group.



Although progress through H-Net's validation procedures was extremely slow going (for reasons beyond my/ our control at H-Net), we have been validated and launched (in May 2013) as 'H-Risk-and-Safety' - http://www.h-net.org/~risk/



Since then I have been working with the editorial and advisory team to sign up those who have expressed interest (approximately 90 academics, based in North America, Australia, and Europe) and to kick-start the group.

One of the resources used on the unit from the 2013-14 session onwards is the podcast of my public lecture at Portsmouth (6 November 2013), both detailed elsewhere on ROS. This unit has helped expose students to a new area of research, producing lively debate across the 12-week term in each of the years the unit has run.

Delivered for the first time in 2012-13, some of the feedback from students included:

Attended by over 40 people (including public, postgrad students, former railway workers, current railway industry safety professionals), it featured a short introductory talk to contextualise the films and use of safety education in Britain, the films and then a lively question-and-answer session. 

In addition to the screening, comments were received from India and Australia noting that the films were of interest and there was an international audience. However, I was unable to webcast the films (both for reasons of technology and permission to use).


54% of impact questionnaire respondents stated their opinion of the topic had been changed by the screening; 90% said they learned something new.

Comments from the questionnaire included:

* 'I am inspired to view more videos and explore opportunities to use other materials'
* One respondent (a safety manager in the rail industry) stated that he would 'look more at historical accidents and look at lessons learnt'

One indication of the impact value of the film screening comes from one of Network Rail's Safety Improvement Specialists, Becky Ray, who said (10/10/13): 'This can be used as a CPD opportunity for those of us who need to record and maintain our professional safety statuses. So this has had a great impact on our safety community.'

Your work ... [was] informative and we wanted to make use of your insights in the programme.

I am also starting a dialogue with the TRL's Head of Transport Psychology about collaborative work on road safety education, including potential funding bids for joint research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>556875f0810834.98491525</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newcomen Society (Southern Branch) invited paper - '&quot;Is it safe?&quot; Technology, education, and workplace accidents on Britain's railways, c.1875-1948'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>726EFB89-6C80-497F-B450-7DD17CC3BF5C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited paper, the audience numbered 16 people and generated some discussion around the themes of the project research and introduced engineering historians to some of the 'softer' approaches to parts of their topics.

The direct impacts are, at this stage, often intangible, although the frequent requests for help, collaboration or assistance that I have received over the years from people and groups beyond the academic community suggests that my research has had an impact. Evidence gathered from events I have hosted suggests that my research changes people's opinions of health and safety.

In the 2016-17 submission year, particular impacts have been seen on three counts. Firstly, my work with the British Safety Council (BSC) on its 60th anniversary, including production of an illustrated book for the BSC's members (health and safety professionals) and the wider public, and providing general advice about digitising and making available its archive. Secondly, I was consulted by the London Road Safety Council on its centenary, and invited to give a presentation about using the past to understand the present at its centenary conference, held in January 2017 at London Guildhall. Thirdly, I am continuing to work with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) on its centenary, including specific consultation over historical content and provision of content for the forthcoming exhibition at the Library of Birmingham.

I have also just been invited, as part of the 'History &amp;amp; Policy' network, to discuss my findings with the Department for Transport in the coming academic year.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C4D58FFE-9701-4D54-B38C-938EE9C1C8B5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df622cdb5b19.60763198</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has revealed the origins of Britain's modern safety culture: not the current obsession with 'elf 'n safety', but a more subtle concern with preventing accidents in daily life. Starting just before the First World War, it made use of safety education: the attempt to persuade people to change their behaviour and act safely.



Focusing on accidents at work, on the roads and in the home, the project has looked at the huge range of items conveying safety advice: from photographs, leaflets and posters, to messages on milk bottle tops, bars of soap and even on Christmas paper! One key finding has been just how widespread and inventive these accident prevention materials were. Tens, if not hundreds, of millions of items were produced and shared: at times it must have been hard to avoid safety education. Importantly, they tried to engage people's attention; they relied on psychological methods, and new technologies were used at an early stage - for example, safety films were made from 1916.



The range of people involved has also been astonishing: this was the 'big society' of its time. Safety activities were initially undertaken by private companies, for the benefit of their employees. With the coming of the motor car and the increase in road deaths, concerned individuals formed 'Safety First' groups to distribute road safety messages; these eventually became the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. With the Second World War, the Government stepped in, forming the Ministry of Information (later the Central Office of Information) to produce and disseminate important messages to British citizens - including about safety. So, it can be seen that concern about safety and accident prevention was spread throughout British society for much of the twentieth century.



Another part of the project's findings has concentrated on the advice given in safety education. The messages have been remarkably consistent, stressing the individual's personal responsibility for safety. The messages were, unsurprisingly, highly gendered: for much of the period, women were shown as responsible for home safety and child safety, whereas men were responsible for safety at work and whilst driving. Young children - or their mothers - were also a major focus of accident prevention advice, particularly road safety material. Whilst all of these messages might have appeared to be neutral 'common sense,' they reflected the values of the day; so, in terms of road safety, until the end of the twentieth century roads were claimed to be places first and foremost for motorised vehicles and not for pedestrians or cyclists. These were not neutral messages; instead, they offered particular views on safety.



How did people respond to accident prevention activities? Initial findings suggest that many simply ignored safety education, and continued to do things as they wanted.



This brief project has only scraped the surface of accident prevention in Britain during the twentieth century. The topic has great potential for future research - particularly as it is something that continues to affect every person in the country to this day.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Project research - into safety education and accident prevention in twentieth-century Britain - has great potential use outside academic history. For example, working with safety/ accident prevention organisations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the British Safety Council may provide pathways to impact - I am currently working with both these organisations to explore the possibilities.



Perhaps most immediately, this would be in the worlds of policy and practice. My research has the potential to show what has been tried in the past to prevent accidents, and how these methods have fared. In meetings with practitioners carried out during the project lifespan I was able to demonstrate how some techniques currently being promoted as new ideas had been tried in the past - some as early as the 1920s. This would apply most directly in workplace safety and road safety, with groups including accident prevention charities, government committees of enquiry, and safety professionals (such as Road Safety Officers).



There is also great potential for public interest, capitalising on interest in and concern about the spread of 'health and safety culture,' as well as on the nostalgia factor, with campaigns such as the 'Green Cross Code', 'Charley Says', or Tufty the road safety squirrel fondly remembered by many people. This has been demonstrated in my 'BBC History Magazine' article on this topic (August 2011), and in my online exhibition produced for the National Railway Museum and focusing on railway safety (went live in November 2014). Public exhibition, therefore, seems to be an important potential use of this research.



Where possible I have started to make all of these links, although this has been a long-term process and is ongoing.



One of the problems the project has suffered from has been a fortunate one: an overabundance of sources. Safety education and accident prevention materials were so commonplace and widespread - tens, if not hundreds, of millions of items were produced and shared - that even though only a fraction of these items have survived, this has still represented a huge challenge. As a result, this project and its findings can only be considered a first look at a massive area. The scope for further research is enormous, and more detailed analytical work needs to be carried out - particularly in relating historical findings to contemporary concerns and to the needs of practitioners/ policy-makers, as well as in bringing this area to the attention of the public.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D796C8F2-F2CF-4567-930F-BA9FBA07E7AC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5366014601.0723095775e916c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>45EF9BFA-5404-40DC-99BF-F7AC79C03DF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regulating Health and Safety in the British Mining Industries, 1800-1914.
