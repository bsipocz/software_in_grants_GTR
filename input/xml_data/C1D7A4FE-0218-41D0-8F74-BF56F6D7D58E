If diagnosed at an early stage, the great majority of patients will be cured. Even those with very advanced disease have a relatively high chance of cure, however this may require them to undergo intensive and toxic treatment, and they will potentially live a long time with any adverse effects of otherwise successful treatment. The MRC CTUs research in patients with testicular cancer has two main aims; to improve the cure rates of those with the poorest prognosis disease and to maintain cure rates while reducing the short and long term side effects of treatment in those with a good prognosis. This is done through the conduct of clinical trials, often involving international partners to ensure the trials are large enough to provide definitive answers. These can then guide the treatment of future patients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Testicular cancer is relatively rare - c1900 new cases per annum in the UK - but is the most common malignancy in young men, and one which has doubled in incidence in the UK over the last 30 years. Diagnosed early, the chances of cure are now excellent, but the age of the typical patient means testicular cancer rates highly in terms of potential years of life lost while surviving patients will live a long time with the side effects of successful treatment. Goals for MRC CTU research into this area are therefore (a) in the poorer prognosis patients, improving survival rates, (b) in the good prognosis patients, minimising the impact of treatment on working status, fertility and general health in the short and long term - without compromising the high cure rates. In December 2009 we successfully completed accrual to the first randomised trial of a novel chemotherapy regimen (CBOP/BEP) for poor prognosis metastatic germ cell tumours. The results will be available in 2010 and will inform decisions on an international strategy for these patients. Updated results of two trials will inform the management of patients with stage I disease. In seminoma, the TE19 trial (in press, Journal of Clinical Oncology) showed that a single dose of carboplatin achieved clinically equivalent results to 2-3 weeks of radiotherapy in terms of relapse-free survival, and reduced the incidence of contralateral testis tumours. In non-seminoma, low risk patients are typically managed by post-operative surveillance, but the optimal surveillance schedule is unknown. The TE08 trial randomised patients between two different radiological surveillance schedules and updated results confirmed that stage at relapse was not compromised by carrying out less frequent CTs (presented at the NCRI conference, October 2009). Surveillance is of increasing interest in stage I seminoma patients, 80% of whom will be cured by surgery alone. However, there is a requirement to balance the need for effective post-operative monitoring to enable prompt detection of relapse with minimising excessive exposure to ionising radiation from current scanning modalities. Current surveillance schedules are based around frequent CT scanning, which has a non-ignorable level of radiation and associated cancer risk. This could be minimised by a reduction in CT scans frequency or by a switch from CT to MRI which uses no radiation. Our randomised phase III trial (TRISST) opened in 2008 and will establish whether a reduced imaging schedule or MRI could be used as a safe and effective alternative to standard CT-based surveillance.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1998-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1219034</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>National Cancer Research Network (NCRN)</gtr:department><gtr:description>TE19 trial</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D231C0C-F412-4249-8B37-A70D681CE8C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration enabled the TE19 trial to continue to collect long-term follow-up data and results from this mature data were presented at a plenary presentation at the American Society for Clinical Oncology in 2008.
