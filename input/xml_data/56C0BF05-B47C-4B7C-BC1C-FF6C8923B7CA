Imagination is surely one of the things that makes us human. It allows us to escape from the here and now, and to travel into the past and the future, the minds of others, the centre of the atom and the outer reaches of space. It allows us to envisage unrealised possibilities, and, sometimes, to bring them about. Our ability to 'visualise', the see things 'in the mind's eye' is a key part of our ability to imagine. This project will bring together researchers from the sciences and the arts to increase our knowledge of visual imagination. 

We will focus on three related areas of research. First, we will look systematically at the large body of research that has examined what happens in the brain when we imagine, searching for consistent patterns in the varied and sometimes conflicting results of previous studies. We will be alert to what these patterns may imply for the uses of visual imagination, from daydreaming to artistic creation. 

Second, we will review the insights and theories which artists, students of art, philosophers and others have proposed over the two and half thousand years since such thinking began. We will ask what questions are raised, by these insights and theories, for the science of imagination.

Finally, we will study individuals whose visual imagery lies at the extremes of the vividness spectrum. A small proportion of healthy individuals, perhaps two or three in a hundred, lack visual imagination completely. This occurrence has been recognised repeatedly but never studied carefully. We will recruit a group of thirty such people and compare them with thirty people who use imagery constantly in their work as visual artists. We will interview the members of both groups to find out how the absence or abundance of visual imagery affects their experience and everyday lives; we will use brain imaging techniques, and psychological tests, to learn more about the causes and consequences of these normal variations in the ability to imagine. 

Pursuing these questions will require a team including an art historian, a psychologist, a neurologist, a philosopher and an artist to meet regularly to exchange ideas and plan the work. We will recruit a young researcher to be the project's research fellow. We expect that he or she will have a background in the arts and an interest in the sciences. We will hold three workshops over the life of the project, which will allow all the researchers involved, and a growing group of collaborators to contribute to the work. The final workshop will be a larger conference at which we will report the findings of the project to experts in the area and interested members of the public. We will give two public lectures, designed to be widely accessible, alongside the conference. We will create a website at the start of the project, updating it as we proceed, providing easily understood information about the project and its findings, and offering opportunities for members of the public to become involved. 

In summary, the project will unite researchers who normally work in isolation from one another in a study of our distinctively human ability to imagine. It will highlight links between our experience, brain science and art. It will throw light on the wide variation in our capacity to 'visualise'. It will pave the way for further work, for example on imagery in other senses, in collaboration with another AHRC project, Rethinking the senses; on neurological and psychiatric disorders, like depression, which can reduce imagination; on how this might be remedied and the use of visual imagination by normal subjects enhanced.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary

Who will benefit?

The academic beneficiaries of this project are described separately, but we emphasise that they include a wide range of researcher in both the humanities and the sciences. Their involvement will help to propagate the wider benefits of the project. These wider benefits will accrue to members of several groups: i) around 25 individuals who have always lacked visual imagery ('aphantasia') have been in contact with us from around the world following our previous publication. They identify their lack of imagery as an important factor in their lives, which many of them would like to remedy if possible, and they are keenly interested in this research. Estimates suggest that 2-5% of individuals can visualise poorly or not at all, implying a large potential audience for our work among affected individuals; ii) as imagery is often used by educationalists and therapists outside the research community, the information that an appreciable proportion of people will find it very difficult to use techniques based on imagery will be important; iii) there is a wide public interest in work of the kind we propose, as attested by the intense press attention to related work (see Pathways to Impact) exploring the neural basis of cultural experience. 

How will they benefit? 

The academic community will benefit from the knowledge gains produced by our project which are described elsewhere. The community will also benefit from the opportunities created by the project workshops and conference for interaction across disciplines and the development of interdisciplinary approaches which will help to build research capacity. The project research fellow will receive a unique training in methods from both the humanities and the sciences of relevance to the study of imagination. 

Individuals with 'aphantasia' will benefit by gaining a fuller understanding of their condition, access to up-to-date information and contact with other individuals in the same situation (assuming appropriate consent). These opportunities will all be provided by our website. Their condition affects their quality of life, and several such individuals have told us that it is therapeutic simply to discover that others report a similar state and researchers are investigating the condition. We anticipate that the artists involved in the project will be stimulated by the realisation that their visual gifts have a partly neural basis.

Educationalists and therapists may be encouraged to screen their students and clients for aphantasia, and to adapt their methods if further research suggests that this would be advisable.

The general public has a keen interest in work bridging the divide between human experience - whether of emotion, thought, memory or imagination - and the processes in the brain that underlie it. This seems to be especially true when the experience in question has a cultural dimension. Through our website, closing conference, public lectures and subsequent educational events we will involve the general public in the excitement of this work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64169</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Eye's Mind: visual imagination, neuroscience and the humanities</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27E126B7-C85E-4BAE-826D-727075DE232B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This activity is the culminating conference of the Eye's Mind project: it occurred on 20-22 May 2016 at the Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts, University of East Anglia. Members of the Eye's Mind team presented the study's findings, Adam Zeman on his study of the extremes of visual imagery, Susan Aldworth on visual imagination in graduate art students, Crawford Winlove on his meta-analysis of brain imaging studies of visualization, Matthew MacKisack on his historical review of thinking about the visual imagination, John Onians on his analysis of the neuroscience of the imagination as it is relevant to the visual arts.. External keynote speakers included Joel Pearson (neuroscience of visual imagery), Michael Tye (philosophical approaches) and Paul Broks (psychology of imagination). There were additional papers from researchers and interested members of the public on topics that intersected with, complemented, expanded, and challenged the work of our project, relating to all aspects of the visual imagination: these included papers by Jools Simner on synaesthesia, Renate Brosch on imagery and reading, Maithilee Kunda on simulation of imagery using artificial intelligence, Nick Watkins on his personal experience of aphantasia. A special issue of the journal Cortex, edited by the Eye's Mind team, will contain papers related to this meeting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c3045874a870.80122138</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/research/neuroscience/theeyesmind/conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Special issue of journal Cortex dedicated to visual imagery, and partly based on our May 2016 conference, to be edited by the PI of our project (Zeman)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C70D00D-F15D-475E-9639-BA4BACDC613E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following our May 2016 conference, which was the culmination of our AHRC funded project, the PI and other members of the team agreed that we would aim to publish a special issue of an appropriate journal written by the speakers at the conference.

The publicity was remarkable, with articles in the NYT, Le Monde and many British papers and radio and TV coverage throughout the world. Following this publicity we have been contacted by over 6000 people, the majority of whom wished to describe their experience of aphantasia. The resulting data are described under 'data bases'.

Several artists and novelists have contacted us in relation to projects inspired by 'aphantasia'. A range of therapists has been in touch to discuss the implications of aphantasia for their clients: recognition of this variation of experience has implications for their practice. A number of educationalists have begun to explore the implications of 'aphantasia' (the absence of visual imagery) for their work with students and children. For example, a Professor of Maxillofacial surgery in London, two mathematics teachers in the US, and an EU funded group of teachers from several EU nations developing a curriculum in creativity are putting our description of aphantasia and related tools to use.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A086B52D-C173-4A0B-8763-B9026BB3A1A3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d5e08d2717f6.03523907</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our project had three threads:

In the first, we reviewed the history of thinking about imagery. We identified strikingly divergent attitudes to the role and importance of visual imagery in human cognition, reflecting, we believe, variations in the authors' individual experience of imagery. 

In the second, we pursued our recent observation (just predating the start of this one year project) that some individuals lack visual imagery entirely, a state we have described as 'aphantasia'. As a result of extensive publicity for this finding, since the Summer of 2015 we have accumulated an archive of over 10,000 contacts from members of the public, the majority with aphantasia. This variation of human experience appears to be both very important to those concerned and substantially more common that we thought at first. We have now obtained around 3000 completed sets of questionnaires from this participant group. 

In the third, we have brought together the existing evidence on the brain regions that become active when we summon images to the mind's eye. We have observed a consistent pattern of activation across studies. This adds to the understanding of the biological basis of visual imagery.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work on aphantasia has attracted wide interest from educationalists and psychotherapists, as 'visualisation' is a widely used technique in education and therapy. Several new collaborators in these fields have begun to explore the implications of aphantasia for their work. 

We anticipate that the work stemming from the other two threads of the subject (imagery in the history of thought; brain activations linked to visual imagery) will contribute to the understanding of these topics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3904AB92-C926-486F-B70F-49808E63CFAF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d5dc567e4151.69643432</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/research/neuroscience/theeyesmind/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Following the extensive publicity resulting from our paper on apantasia on the Summer of 2015 (Aphantasia - lives without imagery.
