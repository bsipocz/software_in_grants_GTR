Across the UK, many institutions carry out research in Computational Linguistics, in such diverse areas as (amongst many others) the automatic generation of natural language, the extraction of information from large collections of documents, or how computers can learn natural languages.Computational Linguistics UK (CLUK) is an organisation for UK researchers in computational linguistics. The aims are to provide support for research students and to ensure that researchers in different areas are aware of what the others are doing.The annual CLUK colloquium is a workshop aimed at research students, allowing them to exchange ideas and receive feedback of their work at an early stage in their PhD (typically the first or second year). The workshop provides an environment for students to submit and present their work and to establish themselves within the national Computational Linguistics community. The 2006 event is being held at the Open University in Milton Keynes, which has a large Computational Linguistics community, spread across different departments.The workshop is organised and run by research students, and submissions are reviewed by a programme committee of research students. In short, the workshop provides research students with experience of all aspects of a full workshop, with academic staff providing only the support as needed by the PhD students.This year, in order to make the workshop as accessible as possible, we intend to make the speaker presentations fully available via a webcast. This has not been attempted at previous CLUK workshops. Additionally, the technology will allow students who present to review their own performance at a later date (e.g., in order to improve their presentation skills).We have requested funding for the costs that this broadcast will require, and for the expenses for a visiting speaker. The workshop has a record of attracting high-quality visiting speakers from within the UK NLP community whose experience allows them to discuss the broad range of subject generally covered at the workshop.The annual workshop has proved extremely valuable, and is now in its ninth year. Students who present at CLUK have often gone on to present their work at major international conferences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-06-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-03-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1107</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/D078679/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
