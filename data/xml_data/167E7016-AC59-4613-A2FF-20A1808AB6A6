research to improve the treatment and survival of women with breast cancer by undertaking randomised controlled trials of new and existing treatments and systematically collecting and analysing the data from all breast cancer trials undertaken worldwide. This collaboration meets every few years and involves around 600 trialists. The published findings have had a major impact on cancer research, resulting in new trials to address important treatment questions that had yet to be reliably addressed. An example of such a trial is the ongoing ATLAS trial, which is run from CTSU and involves more than a 1,000 collaborating doctors in 38 countries, has randomised 13,000 women to either 5 or 10 years treatment with tamoxifen, and has shown that longer treatment improves 15 year survival. The published research findings of the collaboration have also had a major impact on the treatment of breast cancer. It has been referenced in evidence-based guidelines worldwide, including those published by the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence, NICE. While the long-term survival gains identified from the research of the collaboration are each only moderate, the combination of several of these moderate gains have resulted in a halving of breast cancer mortality in the UK for women aged 35-69.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The programme will continue the long-running Early Breast Cancer Triallists? Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) and the ATLAS trial follow-up to obtain large-scale randomised evidence about the long-term main effects and side-effects of local and systemic adjuvant breast cancer treatments, and influence the interpretation of past trials and the design of future trials of treatment and screening. About every 5 years, EBCTCG seeks data on each individual patients in all adjuvant breast trials, for checking and meta-analyses and has previously demonstrated effects on mortality not reliably demonstrable in separate trials. EBCTGCG reports (&amp;gt;14,000 citations) influence practice guidelines and change worldwide treatment patterns. The long-term survival gains identified are each only moderate, but, from the combination of several moderate gains, UK breast cancer mortality at age 35-69 has been halved. The collaboration has also shown that 5-year tamoxifen reduces 10-year and 15-year breast cancer mortality rates by 1/3. It was feared that continuing tamoxifen for more than 5 years might increase rather than decrease recurrence, but CTSU?s ATLAS trial (n=13,000) randomised 10-year vs 5-year tamoxifen and showed 10-year continuation moderately lowers 15-year mortality. Follow-up of ATLAS is continuing, as ER+ disease can recur throughout years 10-20.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1485260</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Nagoya Hospital</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:description>Adjuvant Tamoxifen Longer Against Shorter (ATLAS) Trial</gtr:description><gtr:id>69A8BA78-518E-4CD2-AF5D-BFA669C38B8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Although follow-up continues, interim findings from ATLAS have clearly shown that continuing tamoxifen treatment for 10 years instead of stopping after only 5 years had little effect on either recurrence rates or death rates during the period 5-9 years after diagnosis.

In the UK and US, the combined effects of successive improvements in early detection, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and other systemic treatment can be seen in the large decrease in national breast cancer death rates that started 25 years ago and is still continuing. Since the 1980s, the UK breast cancer death rate at ages 35-69 has halved, and it is still decreasing steeply despite incidence rates increasing over this period. The main reasons for the decrease in mortality are earlier detection and better treatment.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>TU9ZbFt4TVF-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaborators provide individual participant data and other supporting information from their own trials and through the regular meetings of the collaboration provide input to the questions to be addressed, preparation of analysis plans and discussion of results. Since 1983-5, when the EBCTCG was established by CTSU, all researchers who have ever done a randomised trial in early breast cancer have, every 5-6 years, been invited to send anonymised individual data to CTSU for collaborative meta-analyses of the long-term results. These meta-analyses involve statistical and graphical methods that have been developed in CTSU over the past few decades.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>CTSU coordinates the collection and analysis of individual participant data from all randomised trials on the treatment of any aspect of early (apparently operable) breast cancer or of carcinoma in situ of the breast.

Chemo's big boost: The Sun, p. 27, 06/12/11
&amp;quot;Modern chemotherapy drugs are cutting breast cancer deaths by about a third, a study has shown. Researchers at Oxford University looked at 100,000 cases over the past 40 years and found a significant drop in mortality rates. Chemotherapy is effective irrespective of how big the tumour is or if it has spread to lymph nodes.&amp;quot;

Radiation Therapy After Breast Cancer Surgery Cuts Recurrence, Study Says: New York Times, p A23, 20/10/2011
&amp;quot;Radiation treatment after surgery for breast cancer significantly lowers the risk that the disease will recur in the breast or spread lethally to other parts of the body over the next 10 to 15 years, Oxford researchers say. The new findings mean that radiation prevents recurrences for a longer time and saves more lives than was generally recognised, said Sarah Darby, a professor of medical statistics at the University of Oxford.&amp;quot;
