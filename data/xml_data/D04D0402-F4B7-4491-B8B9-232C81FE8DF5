While a certain amount of interest in the subject has been generated in diverse fields such as linguistics, literary criticism, and Deaf studies, no attempt has been made to put together the knowledge from these fields to form a coherent piece of academic research. Our project will centralise the issue of metaphor in creative sign language, bringing together a range of perspectives from different academic disciplines.\n\nThe main areas of research within the study will be:\n\n1. The formal properties of metaphors in creative signing \n\nWhat are the language elements which contribute to our metaphorical understanding of particular expressions and overall themes of the poems/stories?\nWe will specifically look at the following formal features in BSL: handshape, eyegaze, use of space, and blending.\n\n2. Iconicity and metaphor\n\nIconicity plays a crucial role in the formation of metaphors in creative signing. Many expressions in BSL poems and stories make use of metaphors based on visual iconicity to deliver intended message. We will investigate how iconicity and metaphor are interrelated to enhance the poetic effect.\n\n3. Embodiment in creative signing\n\nThe fact that signers use their body and face constrains and motivates certain metaphorical associations. Particularly, the phenomenon of anthropomorphism is salient in creative signing. This project will be the first piece of research which will fully investigate anthropomorphism in sign language literature.\n\n4. Neologisms\n\nIn studying creative signing, it is essential to understand the formation of new, original signs. The project will address the metaphorical motivations behind the mechanism of neologism.\n\nThe questions addressed in this project require multidisciplinary research methods (combining linguistic analysis of the collected data and textual analysis). \nThe research project will also aims at producing the large-scale corpus of signed poems and stories. The project will be conducted in conjunction with British Deaf poets.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243846</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A Twilight Event - run by the Graduate School of Education at Bristol University for public engagement with our research.

Some poets use less metaphor, using iconicity and visual motivation to prioritise realistic descriptions and narrative over metaphor; others used visual elements to blend real and imagined spaces, and create beautiful complex metaphors at conceptual, linguistic and thematic levels. 

We collected over 100 poems to make the world's largest annotated on-line sign language poetry anthology. The size of our anthology allowed us to make generalisations, and study unique individual metaphors. However, the strong visual and gestural elements of poetry made measurements or statistical analysis unreliable; while we could observe 'tendencies', fundamentals like 'lexical items' were hard to determine in the complex visual creations. 

The poems' themes and metaphors often related to deafness, deaf characters and deaf-related issues such as education, sign language and cochlear implants. General themes such as bravery or love also occurred, often revealed through deaf people's world experiences of sight and touch.

Poets frequently took on the role of human characters, creating strong emotions. This characterisation was also the key to anthropomorphism, which occurred extensively and was a dominant trope in the anthology, bringing the form of the human body to the forefront. Poets enjoyed creating it and audiences enjoyed watching it. We found degrees of anthropomorphism: just being a human who has taken on the character of a non-human is a form of anthropomorphism, but non-human objects were given increasingly human forms and behaviours. Animals were most popularly anthropomorphised and often given the power of language; inanimate objects were frequently shown to have emotions and desires; abstract concepts were usually treated as entirely human. Non-physical concepts were mapped onto physical space through blending (e.g. identity, shame or a nation took physical forms as people, animals or objects). Highly abstract ideas were usually expressed through extended metaphors throughout a poem.

Handshapes do contribute significantly to poetic effect. However, the effect is often specific to the poetic context; the same underlying metaphor can be realised by different handshapes (something positive could be shown by an open 'giving' hand or a closed 'solid, reliable' fist) and the same handshape can represent different metaphors (a fist can add a closed, hard, negative sense or a solid strength in a positive sense).

The spatial arrangement of signs often reflects orientational metaphor, at the individual sign level and at higher levels of direct metaphor. For example, contrasting up-down, and central-peripheral in the signing space gave connotations of GOOD IS UP, and CENTRAL IS EMOTIONALLY CLOSE. Left-right was not used metaphorically, as handedness and ease of articulation were more important. Gaze directions often promote positive and negative ideas, or show power relationships between two characters. Gaze also reveals other metaphors such as KNOWING IS SEEING or IMPORTANT IS VISIBLE.

The poems were rich in neologisms. Characterisation led to highly gestural signs never seen before, as they depended on the forms chosen for the character. Newly created 'entity' and 'size and shape' classifier signs were motivated by metaphor, although iconicity and the overall formal structure of the poem also motivated them.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research has enormous potential for impact within the Deaf community. The very existence of the anthology created as part of the project advances the status of the art-form and its content promotes and validates the work of under-appreciated artists. It can encourage other signing poets to produce their own work, nationally and internationally, inspired by this. It can inform and influence the work of spoken language poets and visual artists. It can be used in schools for deaf and hearing children to see the potential of sign language for creative expression. It can be used by language learners and also by sign language/spoken language interpreters.
