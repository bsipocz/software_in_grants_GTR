The cinematic techniques of the realist mise-en-scene and its corollary linear narrative as developed in the West, existed as a priori that were adopted and adapted to existing pre-modern Japanese storytelling paradigms. This, I argue, is an interactive, and not an externally imposed, process. The role of the benshi as 'photo-interpreter' in the exposition of the film experience for Japanese cinema-goers in the early twentieth century provides just one example of this process of accretion. In this companion volume, 1 turn to the iconoclastic filmmakers of Japan's dying Avant-garde who, since the early-1960s, in an attempt to shatter the conservative discourses of mainstream Japanese cinema, created a counter-cinema that not only attempted to address, but to create, a new audience. As part of this project 'truth', as defined through the narratives of mainstream cinema (history as collective memory and a social morality of consensus) had to be freed from the trap of 'realism'. Hence the desire to work back from established genres, studio house-styles and the star system to forms, techniques, styles and non-linear narrative patterns that openly disrupted and de-stabilised the accepted grammar of cinema. Historicity, as layers of time and the sexual and the criminal as constitutive elements in the expression of individual desire outside consensual morality, became the contested terrain of narrative, while 'realism' and reflexivity became the contested terrain of representation. This project brought cinema into the capital 'P' politics of Japanese life and cannot be separated from the student movements of the 1950s and 1960s. It also drew upon Italian Neo-Realism and was concomitant with, but not an imitation of, the French New Wave.

The book opens with an expository chapter in which I argue that the Japanese Avant-garde was a very specific response to WWII, defeat and the betrayal of the promises of 'democratic' politics under the exigencies of American Cold War foreign policy. In Japan in the 1950s, the screenings of films from the Italian Neo-Realist movement of the late-1940s provided the impetus and direction for the development of alternative cinematic representations. The subsequent chapters are organised around the following themes: chapter one, history and the representation of 'time'; here I draw on Deleuze's concept of the 'time-image' and its relation to representations of WWII and key incidents of the 1930s such as 26th February Incident of 1936. Chapter two, sexuality as an expression of individuation; there is a simplistic equation between
women and sexuality, however, women are also equated with a quintessential native Japanese essentialism. Chapter 3, focusing on the documentary film The Emperors Naked Army Marches On juxtaposed with a discussion of Battle Royale II and the challenge posed to Japanese society by the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult taken up in the documentaries A and A2, examines the legacies of the 1960s avant-garde in the challenge these films make to the identity of the nation built on myths of war, racial and cultural homogeneity. The book concludes with a chapter, tentatively titled 'The Last Avant-garde' which argues that, largely through changes in the film industry on the global scale, the Japanese movement represented one of the last true avant-garde film movements. As a contrastive example, I shall cite the Korean 'New Wave' of the
1980s which grew spontaneously out of the student and people's (minjung) movements only to be marginalised from world 'art house' cinema circuits by the government backed 'New Korean Cinema' of the late-1990s.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26242</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E504671/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
