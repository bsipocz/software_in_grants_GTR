The earliest dissenting academies were established after the Restoration as a result of the 1662 Act of Uniformity, and were intended to provide Protestant students dissenting from the Church of England with a higher education similar to that at Oxford and Cambridge, from which they were largely excluded. Their main purpose was to prepare candidates for the ministry, but many educated lay students as well. The tutors and students at the academies contributed in fundamental ways to the development of ideas, notably in the fields of theology, philosophy, literature, and science. In the course of the nineteenth century the academies' original purpose was largely superseded by the founding of London University and the provincial universities, which were open to dissenters, and by the eventual reform of Oxford and Cambridge. The surviving academies were transformed into denominational training colleges for ministerial candidates.
 The Dissenting Academies Project will have two outcomes: A History of the Dissenting Academies in the British Isles, 1660-1860, a multi-authored book in preparation, and Dissenting Academies Online, two fully searchable databases already published on the Dr Williams's Centre website. The second database, the AHRC-funded Virtual Library System, uses modern library software to recreate virtual historic libraries from surviving library catalogues and loan records. The libraries included are those of Bristol Baptist College, Manchester College (largely Unitarian) in Manchester and York, and the Congregational Colleges of Mile End and Homerton in London. Users can search for particular titles or authors; browse the shelves of an academy library; compare the holdings of different libraries; and browse, search, and sort students' loan records. They can learn about the acquisition and use of books in dissenting education, and the impact that books had on the students' intellectual formation. The VLS has already been recognised as an important and innovative resource, the first of its kind, which will transform our understanding of the circulation of books and ideas in dissenting education and establish a model for future work with historic libraries.
 In the course of the Library project far more archival material was uncovered than could be entered into the database. The VLS includes more data on the Baptist and Unitarian academies than on the Congregational ones, and only Congregational academies in the London area are represented. The aims of the follow-on project on the Northern Congregational College, Manchester, are to enlarge the original database to include the libraries of Congregational colleges in Yorkshire and Lancashire, to extend the date up to the twentieth century, and to enter provenance details of individual books for the first time. The project will show how a twentieth-century denominational library developed through a process of acquisition, donation, inheritance, and transfer from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries, and how books moved from private to educational use, thereby demonstrating the strength of Congregationalism in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Yorkshire and Lancashire. The project has a number of applications and benefits: it will engage those currently training Congregational ministers in their own heritage and educational history; it will provide a model for librarians and book historians for recovering information about dispersed and lost book collections; it will show contemporary private libraries how they can make their own historic library collections searchable online through the model of the VLS; and it will introduce religious, educational, social, library, and book historians to a new way of researching the history of reading.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Three main groups will benefit from the project on the Northern Congregational College library: libraries (public, university, and private); historical societies; and ministerial training organisations. 
 Manchester Central Library, owner of one of the two surviving copies of Catalogue of the Library of the Lancashire Independent College, Manchester (Manchester, 1885), will benefit from the entering of the titles in the Virtual Library System; the John Rylands University Library, Manchester, owner of the 2460 surviving books from the Northern Congregational College library, has given permission for and will benefit from the entering of the titles, together with provenance details and images of these, into the VLS, and has offered to hold a seminar at the end of the project; The Leeds Library, a proprietary subscription library originating in the eighteenth century and now a private charity, will benefit from seeing what the VLS model can offer institutions with early catalogues, borrowing records and surviving books and from the analysis of how the holdings of a major northern library came together, and has also offered to hold a seminar at the end of the project; the Congregational Library, housed in Dr Williams's Library, London, and the Congregational Memorial Hall Trust have expressed keen interest through the Congregational Library Committee, and one of its members is loaning the catalogue of the Rotherham Independent College Library; Dr Williams's Library, the Project Partner, will hold a seminar after the project is concluded. Two other early libraries in Manchester which are also charitable trusts, Chetham's Library and The Portico Library, have also expressed strong support for the project, as have two historical societies, the Chetham Society and Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society.
 The two main organisations for training ministers in the Congregational tradition are very interested in the way the project can be used to engage students in the educational history of their predecessors: Northern College (United Reformed and Congregational), Luther King House, Manchester, the direct modern descendant of the Congregational colleges of Yorkshire and Lancashire; and the Integrated Training Board of the Congregational Federation, Nottingham.
 Representatives of all these organisations will be invited to the seminars and encouraged to use the VLS and where relevant adopt its methods for their own institutions. The open access database is hosted on the website of the Dr Williams's Centre for Dissenting Studies at http://vls.english.qmul.ac.uk/ and can be used by members of the public for their own searches (statistics of users of the Centre's three databases are already being collected). In the longer term the timescale for the benefits to be realised will depend on interested libraries - whether those named above, or other charitable societies in the UK or the USA - taking steps to use the methods pioneered by the VLS to enter their own catalogues. The response from academics, librarians, and members of relevant organisations to the original Dissenting Academy Libraries project and the creation of the VLS has left no doubt: the VLS is a unique, innovative and pioneering resource which will in due course be imitated in the digital humanities world. The RAs working on the project will be able to use their bibliographical, data entering and analytical skills to develop similar projects elsewhere.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95820</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>John Rylands Library</gtr:department><gtr:description>The Northern Congregational College Library Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>2E3C9598-4E9D-43F2-9CD0-998D8616B058</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project will have two outcomes, one print and one online: A History of the Dissenting Academies in the British Isles, 1660-1860 (to be published by Cambridge University Press), and Dissenting Academies Online (http://www.qmulreligionandliterature.co.uk/research/the-dissenting-academies-project/dissenting-academies-online/).

In 1984 the Northern Congregational College became Northern College (United Reformed and Congregational). Most such libraries were founded on private collections and supplemented over generations through bequest and donation. Selected books were acquired in 1975/6 by the The John Rylands Library, Manchester. These books, dating from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, are unusually rich in provenance and evidence of use. Perhaps most interesting are the marks of ownership and use of the everyday reader - men and women who owned only a handful of books and whose annotations are the only evidence of their interaction with them. The details, including high-resolution images of bookplates, inscriptions and annotations, are now published on Dissenting Academies Online: Virtual Library System http://vls.english.qmul.ac.uk/, a union catalogue which represents the holdings and loans of selected Baptist, Congregational, and Presbyterian/Unitarian academies in England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Together with Dissenting Academies Online: Database and Encyclopedia http://dissacad.english.qmul.ac.uk/, the VLS forms part of the ongoing Dissenting Academies Project http://www.qmulreligionandliterature.co.uk/research/the-dissenting-academies-project/
