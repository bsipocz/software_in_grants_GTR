perception</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K011766/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The way that animals use visual information to move around and interact with objects involves a highly complex interaction between visual processing, neural representation and motor control. Understanding the mechanisms involved is of interest not only to neuroscientists but also to engineers who must solve similar problems when designing control systems for autonomous mobile robots and other visually guided devices.

Traditionally, neuroscientists have assumed that the representation delivered by the visual system and used by the motor system is something like a 3D model of the outside world, even if the reconstruction is a distorted version of reality. Recently, evidence against such a hypothesis has been mounting and an alternative type of theory has emerged. 'View-based' models propose that the brain stores and organises a large number of sensory contexts for potential actions. Instead of storing the 3D coordinates of objects, the brain creates a visual representation of a scene using 2D image parameters, such as widths or angles, and information about the way that these change as the observer moves. This project examines the human representation of three-dimensional scenes to help distinguish between these two opposing hypotheses.

To do this, we will use immersive virtual reality with freely-moving observers to test the predictions of the 3D reconstruction and 'view-based' models. Head-tracked virtual reality allows us to control the scene the observer sees and to track their movements accurately. Certain spatial abilities have been taken as evidence that the observer must create a 3D reconstruction of the scene in the brain. For example, people are able to view a scene, remember where objects are, walk to a new location and then point back to one of the objects they had seen originally even if it is no longer visible (i.e. people can update the visual direction of objects as they move). However, this capacity does not necessarily require that the brain generate a 3D model of the scene and, as evidence, we will extend view-based models to include this pointing task and others like it. We will then test the predictions of both view-based and 3D reconstruction models against the performance of human participants carrying out the same tasks. 

As well as predicting the pattern of errors in simple navigation and pointing tasks, we will also measure the effect of two types of stimulus change. 3D reconstruction uses 'corresponding points' which are points in an image that arise, for example, from the same physical object (or part of an object) as a camera or person moves around it. Using a novel stimulus, we will keep all of these 'corresponding points' in a scene constant yet, at the same time, changing the scene so that the images alter radically when the observer moves. This manipulation should have a dramatic effect on a view-based scheme but no effect at all on any system based only on corresponding points.

Overall, we will have a tight coupling between experimental observations and quantitative predictions of performance under two types of model. This will allow us to determine which of the two models most accurately reflects human behaviour in a 3D environment. One potential outcome of the project is that view-based models will provide a convincing account of performance in tasks that have previously been considered to require 3D reconstruction, opening up the possibility that a wide range of tasks can be explained within a view-based framework.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our experiments aim to deliver a more accurate model of human spatial representation and navigation behaviour than exists at present. There are clear industrial applications for this type of knowledge in several distinct areas. We have two existing collaborations that allow us to have a direct impact. First, we have a long-standing relationship with Microsoft Research Cambridge, who fund a current PhD student with us (since October 2011). Andrew Fitzgibbon, who co-supervises the project, and others at Microsoft (John Winn, Antonio Criminisi) are interested in algorithms that use non-Cartesian, view-based representations for applications that have traditionally relied on 3D metric models.

Second, we have a collaboration with the car manufacturer, Renault. They perform much of their car-interior prototyping in virtual reality, and are keenly interested in perception data coming from our lab in order to determine which types of scene manipulation will have a noticeable perceptual effect and which will not. They also have a strong interest in the calibration methods and high-quality virtual reality that we have available in our laboratory. Renault will fund a new PhD student in our lab starting in 2012.

Our laboratory is involved in a range of out-reach activities, including open days for the public and for school children from the Sutton Trust. Dr Glennerster has advertised the work of the lab giving plenary and other talks at 3DTV conferences, where producers and technologists alike are interested in problems with the way that 3DTV and 3D cinema is interpreted and perceived. Dr Glennerster has given public lectures (e.g. Royal College of Surgeons) and our laboratory has engaged the public in a demonstration at the Royal Society of the mutations involved in the potassium channel affected in neonatal diabetes: children could fly through a model of their own channel as it opened and closed and was 'mended' by the drug that cured their condition.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>419878</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Microsoft Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Microsoft Research Cambridge</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Microsoft Research, Cambridge</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB69A793-8C7C-47BD-BE0E-54728F489F7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Yes, this is multi-disciplinary (computer vision and human psychophysics).

This demonstrates that 'low-level cues' such as the range of slants people see, are not the only cause of adaptive changes in the visual system. We have also published a review paper on how to set up a high-fidelity virtual reality lab (at one point this was the most downloaded paper in Journal of Vision) and a theoretical paper on the problem of visual stability. A major review paper on the problem of spatial representation in a moving observer was published in Phil Trans B. This sets out a radical alternative to theories that suppose the brain builds 3D 'maps' or reconstructions of the scene. Another paper comparing view-based and reconstruction models as predictors of human navigation in a homing task has been reviewed and should be accepted for publication in Journal of Vision after minor revisions. Another paper will be submitted soon describing the errors that people make when they point at remembered objects after walking to a new location. We show that models based on an internal 3D reconstruction are poor at predicting human pointing in this task and describe a heuristic that predicts pointing more accurately.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are collaborating with engineers who are interested in adaptive control systems. These results have implications for the design of such systems. We are now developing a more extensive collaboration with Professor Phil Torr's group the Department of Engineering in Oxford and with Professor Abhinav Gupta's lab in the Robotics Group at Carnegie Mellon University.
