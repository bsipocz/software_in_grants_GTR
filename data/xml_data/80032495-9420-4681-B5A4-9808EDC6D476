This research helps inform policy and decision making bodies in their response to environmental and climate issues. Through NERC funded work, significant expertise and data has been built up which could be re-exploited in commercial sectors. 

The fellow aims to champion NERC science to the commercial service industry who are using satellite Earth Observation (EO) imagery to provide products and services in the domains of agriculture and land environment. To this end, the fellow will collaborate with the Satellite Applications Catapult; one of several innovation and technology centres set up by UK government to bring together scientists and businesses to support the development of new products and services. The fellow will work with the Catapult's partners in the EO commercial service sector to help identify where NERC science can overcome existing barriers to service provision in terms of technical knowledge, expertise or underpinning environmental information. By so doing, it is anticipated that NERC funded science can be translated into commercial products and services with strong socio-economic benefits to the wider world. 

The fellow will address a number of activities to stimulate joint projects and collaborative working. These will include presentations to industry meetings and academic groups as well as joint workshops where different parties can meet and discuss common interests. The work will seek not just to form new linkages, and strength existing ones, but will seek to translate those connections into collaborative activities such as joint projects or studentships. To this end, the fellow will actively support industrial-academic collaborations in terms of bidding, helping to lead proposals to turn novel ideas into real projects and service prototypes. 
The outcome of the fellow's activities will be a set of demonstration projects which will illustrate the potential use of EO data in collaboration with environmental science. The fellow will also demonstrate the impact of NERC research in terms of wider socio-economic benefit. 

This fellowship is strongly focused on the exploitation of environmental information over land, and will focus on issues such as biodiversity, environmental management, agricultural monitoring and insurance, precision farming, plantations monitoring and the impact of pests and diseases. The work is by no means limited to these topics and will consider the wider application of environmental science in terms of the energy sector (e.g. renewables and biofuels) as well as other sectors where strong potential for commercial services based on EO datasets are found.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>148462</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on Soil Moisture</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63ACE05C-FF43-49A2-9BC3-F8A388C0A273</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Planned, organised and ran a workshop, in collaboration with Satellite Applications Catapult and the Instiution for Environmental Analytics, to explore the UK's interests and expertise in soil moisture. This was aimed at UK academics working on topics related to soil moisture and industry users wanting to exploit the information. The workshop drew together specialists in satellite imaging, modelling and in-situ sensor networks. Government and third party organisations were also present. The workshop presented some of the state of the art from academics (including a number of NERC scientists) and then presented the challenges that industry are facing and why they need soil moisture information. The attendees then worked on identifying the UK's strengths and weaknesses in this area, and the next steps the community should take to move the issue forward. A report is currently being written for circulation with recommendations for future activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a72fa0db77e7.22396888</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://sa.catapult.org.uk/news-events-gallery/events/soil-moisture-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Local company presentation (at Leicester)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3CBD47A3-89FA-4D9D-A739-94E24C3C2A9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation by local company Sterling GEO to PG researchers and academic staff at University of Leicester on some of Sterling GEO's portfolio of software and what use researcher's could put this to.

This has involved engagement with around 50 companies to date, and around 70 NERC remit academics or researchers to help support and overcome barriers to collaborative working. As a result, 13 number of collaborative bids have been written to enable industry to work with academia or for industry focused academic bids associated with the use of satellite imagery for agricultural or related applications. Further work is on-going supporting the potential re-use of NERC datasets by industry. One training course to help both industry and academic researchers using particular types of satellite imagery has been established. A workshop on the topic of soil moisture has been run to explore the interest from industry in the topic and how their needs can be met by existing NERC science.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>10B55D90-9BD3-4636-826C-A82C893B5508</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bb17445d6a62.27073140</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contributed to the UK Innovation and Growth Strategy Updated Report on the Agri-Tech Sector</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>169EA063-C6A8-45D1-A147-E9303F81D3AE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58a731771d0a64.33762939</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/M020576/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>68D4AB6A-88C3-4368-8A94-2DADEEF21FF5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioenergy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>96F70ACB-D35F-416F-9360-4EFD402DFA6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Soil science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
