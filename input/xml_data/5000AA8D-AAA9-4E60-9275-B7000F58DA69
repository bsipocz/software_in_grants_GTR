&lt;p>The central aim of the project is to utilise fathers? narratives to deepen the evidence base and inform policy and practice. A key task is to conduct a literature review of interventions aimed at supporting men as fathers after divorce/separation. This will include working with local and national organisations and user groups, to gather insight about services and good practice. Such groups will include: One Plus One, Relate, National Association of Child Contact Centres, CAFCASS, Norfolk Family Mediation Service, Mancroft Advisory Project Norwich. A report will be produced to synthesise and evaluate the current evidence base, identify key findings, issues and existing good or innovative practice. This report will be launched at an event aimed at practitioners in third sector and statutory organisations, academics and policy makers, to be held in October 2012.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77413</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch event for final report</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A720774-6305-449B-8FF0-FC9FBFFD47E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Provoked useful cross-disciplinary discussion afterwards, and provided useful networking

The presentation combined research evidence with insights from professional practice, to consider ways in which men as fathers may be perceived and supported by family welfare services. I discussed and reviewed recent research which explores barriers to, and benefits of father-engagement and Andy presented a case study of a successful project working with young fathers in Norfolk.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589d9fb47abad4.77411358</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Practitioner seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3693FE80-6055-4A54-9887-4B81D5BD7295</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar prompted useful discussion among practitioners

In terms of social policy, individual and institutions alike are expected to 'Think Fathers' (DEF2010). Given proposals to reform legal aid in private family law (Ministry of Justice 2010) and the Coalition commitments to facilitate shared parenting and relationship support (HM Government 2010) enriching the evidenced base for such intervention is crucial. This is particularly the case with data of fathers' perspective. My research contributes to current debates on shared parenting and child welfare (Hunt, Masson &amp;amp; Trinder 2009, Lamb &amp;amp; Kelly 2009), emphasing the significance of the gendered and moral aspects of parenting identity and practice. It can be applied to a range of settings in which intervention's for separating families are offered, by highlighting ways in which some fathers have coped with maintaining parenting relationships.



My study explored experiences of divorced or separated fathers who felt they had maintained relationships with their children. The overall aim was to understand how fathers adjust to being a dad after divorce or separation, focusing on men's own views on their lives as fathers. It also offered important insights into what makes this easier or harder, about what kind of 'work' in involved in fathering beyond divorce, and about the ongoing influence of gender in shaping this process. The research showed that fathers see fathering after separation as occurring in connection with others, and as particularly interconnected with mothers. Trying to stay close to and spend time with children demanded more time and attention to how this happens and the 'relationship work' involved. This included changes such as thinking about the needs and feelings of children (biological or step) and mothers, trying to decide the 'right' thing to do, and trying to be fair to different people. The research highlights these ideas of 'relationship work' and dealing with normal questions or dilemmas It shows how both were an important part of being a father after divorce or separation and that working towards a 'bearable' solution was as difficult and ongoing process.



In line with the UEA CRCF's commitment to communicate new evidence to practitioners, policy makers and the public, across the statutory and voluntary sectors, this proposal will present my research finding to a range of audiences and use the analysis of fathers' narratives to inform practice guidance. One strand of the proposal is to disseminate the research through academic journals, presenting not only this substantive findings. But also methodological insights and broader theoretical arguments produced by the research. Another key strength of my work lies in its relevance for applied settings, including social work, family law, and providers of mediation, support or contact facilitation services for separating families. I will there engage with regional and national organisations (Norfolk Family Mediation Service, National Association of Child Contact Centres, CAFCASS, One Plus One, Relate) in order to discuss research findings and inform the practice guidance. As part of this broader dissemination, I will also build on contacts established with a key young fathers' group in Norfolk. This engagement will proved another important context for evaluating the impact of my research and will inform the development of practice guidance. The culmination of these dissemination activities will be the launch of practice guidance at an event for relevant individuals and organisation to be held at a UEA CRCF seminar at UEA London. The fellowship will thus enable me to contribute to academic debates, enrich practitioner knowledge and so inform support interventions, and to continue to engage with separated fathers as key beneficiaries of the research</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am giving a presentation to family support practitioners at an event entitled 'Working with fathers; Research evidence for practice' organised by Jonathan Scourfield in March 2015</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A0F3021E-1460-4B01-B083-AADF3F69F868</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-474008005.55386394779b7faa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CD810286-461C-4F83-910B-3D2FC7E20639</gtr:id><gtr:title>Are interventions supporting separated parents father-inclusive?
