Integrating environmental concerns into economic policy has assumed greater urgency due to the need for alternative development models to counter current global recession and also growing pressures from climate change and overconsumption.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While still largely just a normative ideal, the green economy concept is nonetheless beginning to emerge more forcefully in political discourses. However, some environmentalists remain cautious since this notion seemingly downplays existing political commitments to long term sustainability while promoting an underlying techno-centric economic agenda. Whether countries can transition towards viable green economies and therefore ensure long-term sustainability remain fundamental points of discussion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These issues will be addressed in the ESRC sponsored seminar series, which is based around three central themes of the green economy, namely green budgeting, green jobs and green equity. By drawing on the comparative national experience of multiple stakeholders, both academic and non-academic, the research will aim to identify both constraints and facilitators to the green economy transition and evaluate the sustainability of approaches adopted. Findings will be employed to develop normative recommendations for policy-makers on promoting greater integration of the environment into national economic objectives.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Research on the green economy is very much in its infancy. While a growing policy objective in political discourses, it remains both underdeveloped and poorly understood. It is consequently anticipated that there will be a number of stakeholders from the proposed seminar series, both academic and non-academic, who will benefit directly and indirectly through a variety of means. 

Firstly, as outlined in the 'Academic Beneficiaries' section of this application, the seminar series will directly benefit academic participants as it will provide a venue to present innovative research on the green economy issue with a view to disseminating findings further through academic publication and communication to non-academic stakeholders such as policy-makers. 

Secondly, the series will directly benefit other academics and students. The applicants will ensure that the research is publicised as widely as possible to an academic audience through publications, conference papers, university websites and will incorporate material into their undergraduate and postgraduate teaching programmes. 

Thirdly, the seminar series has obvious direct benefits for partner organisations. Both the EAC and EEAC perform a valuable advocacy and advisory role for EU national governments in relation to critical environmental issues. The Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) meanwhile is one of the leading environmental policy research bodies in the EU, providing input to policy processes at the EU and national levels. The research generated on the green economy will therefore have the potential to directly input into the development of political strategies at the EU and national government level. In addition, as the EEAC is currently developing its position, in conjunction with Member States, on the upcoming Rio+20 conference on global sustainable development, the research would be timely and potentially extremely valid. The Principal Investigator is also affiliated to several leading research groups, including the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, the Centre for Social and economic Research on the Global Environment and the Earth Systems governance network, all of whom will benefit from the seminar outputs. The co-investigators are also connected to a variety of partner organisations who will also gain from research generated on best practice within the green economy, most notably the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council, Pennine Prospects and Business in the Community.

Fourthly, the wider, indirect benefits of the seminar series research on the green economy are potentially high. Dissemination of outputs via different stakeholders and media pathways will ensure that ideas generated will be available to other environmental organisations and political bodies with the aim of stimulating further debate on the green economy. 

In summary, in terms of 'who' will benefit, the seminar series will engage both academic and non-academic users. When considering 'how' they will benefit, the programme will provide significant opportunities to develop 'impact' through generating research, stimulating debate on the green economy issue and providing policy relevant recommendations to partners.
