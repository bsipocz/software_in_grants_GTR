The reasons for this are unclear but may partly be due to physical illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes which are more common in this group. It is also though that African-Caribbean people with dementia are less likely to receive specialist medical care for this condition. This aim of this project is to compare memory problems between African-Caribbean and white, British born people over 60 years of age. As well as estimating the numbers of people suffering dementia I will be investigating how this condition is viewed and how help is sought. I plan to do this in the North London Borough of Haringey which has a large Caribbean population. People will be approached through their G.P practices and interviewed in their own homes. This will involve a short memory test and more detailed questions about their general health, social circumstances and perceptions of dementia. The results of this research will help us to understand more about dementia in the African-Caribbean population and lead to an improvement in the services and treatments offered.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: There is now evidence that older people of African-Caribbean origin may have a higher prevalence of dementia (up to 17% =60 yrs) and that they are less likely than their White UK-born counterparts to have their illness treated with an equitable level of resources. The reasons for these findings are largely unknown but socio-economic and environmental factors have been implicated as has the possibility that they are expressions of different cultural understandings of ageing and care for the elderly. A recent study has suggested that the higher prevalence of dementia may be related to the increased risk of hypertension and ineffective detection or treatment. The NSF for older people recognises this increased risk and stipulates that services should be culturally appropriate and accessible to minority groups.

Objectives: 
a) to test my hypothesis that the prevalence of dementia is higher in the African-Caribbean older population.
b) To determine whether dementia in this population is under recognised in primary care.
c) To examine pathways to care and barriers that obstruct access to equitable care.

Methods: 
1- Two stage Survey. 2- Qualitative study
In collaboration with Haringey tPCT, BEH Mental Health NHS Trust and the local primary care research network I will enlist GP practices within Haringey, North London. An estimated 1000 people of Caribbean origin aged =60 years live in Haringey. I plan to identify and screen 350 of these people, selected from general practice lists and through contacts in local voluntary organisations. I will also screen a randomly selected, matched comparison sample of white UK-born people. I will use a standardised interview in those that screen positive to make the diagnosis of dementia. I will then employ in-depth qualitative interviews to explore perceptions of dementia and identify barriers to best practice in a purposively selected sample of patients and carers. I will also investigate social networks and assess service usage. Finally, I will recruit a number of GPs and primary care staff from local practices. Using qualitative methods I will examine their confidence and competence in the detection and management of dementia in the African-Caribbean older population.

Opportunities: This project will enhance our knowledge about the scale of dementia and its subtypes in this population and what determines the care that patients may or may not receive. This could subsequently inform the development of culturally appropriate, equitable and accessible services for dementia both locally and nationwide.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-09-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>258686</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FCA1F399-2222-4EC8-BCC2-D68F56349B7A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prevalence of dementia in African-Caribbean compared with UK-born White older people: two-stage cross-sectional study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c7421cb2b692a233f6a614267eebda3"><gtr:id>7c7421cb2b692a233f6a614267eebda3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adelman S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0007-1250</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>g9CZNHTVxK2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4D605AB3-EADC-493E-9A2C-3F70D6526D67</gtr:id><gtr:title>A systematic review of the prevalence and covariates of dementia or relative cognitive impairment in the older African-Caribbean population in Britain.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International journal of geriatric psychiatry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c7421cb2b692a233f6a614267eebda3"><gtr:id>7c7421cb2b692a233f6a614267eebda3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adelman S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0885-6230</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>BDpjBFNHnyo</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G106/1246</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>2472941E-25F2-45EC-A735-3C0872CE6B26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.3  Psychological, social and economic factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>9A8BEDCC-D902-4C9A-8CCF-C974265EA3FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.4  Surveillance and distribution</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E4AF608A-CDB6-4CE6-AA10-95B3E043E22F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.1  Organisation and delivery of services</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
