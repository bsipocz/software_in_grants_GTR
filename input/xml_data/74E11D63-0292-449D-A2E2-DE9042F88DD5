The nutritional benefits of fish consumption have a positive link to increased food security and decreased poverty rates in developing countries. Fish, particularly produced through aquaculture, is commonly cheaper than other animal feed, and can be consumed by lower income individuals. Fish also contains much higher protein levels, as well as other important minerals and vitamins. Increased availability of fish can mean better health and a more diverse diet.
Undoubtedly promoting and maintaining fish health is paramount for enhancing fish production.
Extensive research has shown that microbes that reside in the intestine have important roles in maintaining and promoting the health of the host. They can breakdown some food materials to some essential nutrients and vitamins important to maintaining immunity, health and well-being of the host. The microbes also protect the gut from colonization by pathogenic bacteria. 
The identity of fish gut microbial composition and how they can be influenced by environmental, dietary and developmental factors is in its infancy. There are carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous fish which naturally select specific diets. We do not know if their digestive physiology can adapt to consume commercial feed. This knowledge is important of formulation of appropriate feed to avoid digestive problems.
In this project, a group of scientists knowledgeable in nutrition, intestinal physiology/microbiology and intestinal adaptation to dietary change aim to assess the impact of i) habitat (farms), ii) fish species of different dietary habits, iii) diet and iv) fish maturation, on the microbial populations that reside in the fish intestine.
The intestinal content of 1) adult carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous fish obtained from different locations (farms) and 2) fry of the same species, grown under controlled conditions and maintained on different defined diets, will be used. Using modern technologies, the precise composition of microbial populations, and the nutrients they produce, will be determined. Other bodily parameters such as growth, food conversion ratio, and gut morphology will be assessed.
Anticipated outcomes are: 
Proving information on microbial populations that reside in intestines of herbivorous, carnivorous and omnivorous fish.
Identifying contributions of environment, diet and fish species on the composition and activity of gut microbes.
Gaining knowledge on the responses of predominant microbial populations to environment, diet, host and developmental signals.
Impact: Characterization of gut microbiota during fish maturation and in fish with different dietary habits will allow scientifically-based feed (feed supplement) formulation to enhance selective gut microbial populations that promote fish growth, health and productivity.
Benefits from this research are to:
Fish: The correct diet will maintain and promote fish health and welfare, prevent disease and increase productivity.
The public: Increasing availability of fish means better health and more diverse diet.
Society and Economy: Contributing towards wealth creation and economic prosperity. Commercial aquaculture has the potential to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.

In addition to quantitatively determine the levels of microbial-derived metabolites within the intestinal tracts of the same fish.

Obtaining fish from different locations (farms) we aim to identify i) whether host type or habitat has the greater influence on intestinal microbiota and metabolites, within the same species, ii) inter-individual variation within the same species raised in the same habitat, and iii) differences in microbiota and metabolites between disparate species.

Growing fry under controlled conditions and maintained on defined diets we aim to determine influences of diet and/or ontogenetic signals on resident gut microbiota and metabolites during different maturation stages (fry; adolescent; adult).

Bacterial metabolites will be measured in intestinal contents.
Feed consumption rate, fish weight and gut morphology will be assessed during feeding trials.

Methodology: Bacterial DNA will be extracted from fish intestinal contents, purified and quantified. Next-generation sequencing will be used to analyze 16S rRNA gene sequences. Raw sequencing reads will be subjected to bioinfomatic analyses in order to provide the phylogenetic framework for describing community structure, allowing characterization of microbial ecosystems, its richness and diversity. Bacterial metabolites will be measured by gas chromatography and quantified in relation to an internal standard. Feed consumption rate, weight and gut morphology will be determined by measuring various body parameters and by morphometric analyses.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic Impact:
The outcome of this research will act as a platform for further studies in fish addressing issues such as the identification of safe and effective replacements for antibiotics, effect of environmental change and exposure to toxins and pollutants.
 
The outcome of this project will provide new knowledge that enhances scientific advancement nationally and internationally. It will offer valuable information for scientists and practitioners of diverse disciplines including physiologists, veterinarians, nutritionists, microbiologists, molecular biologists and geneticists. It will contribute to developing expertise and knowledge in multi-disciplinary areas.

Using this methodology and subsequently sequencing the DNA isolated from the intestine of a carnivorous fish (trout) and an omnivorous fish (carp), we have identified that in both fish types: 1) there are distinct differences in gut bacteria of two fish with different dietary habits, 2) gut bacterial populations of fish are very different to those present in the mammalian intestine and 3) the environment (different farms) has a profound effect on shaping fish gut microbiota. These findings are significant and show that it is possible to manipulate fish gut bacterial composition positively by environmental factors (for example diet) to maintain health and to promote growth and productivity. This work is now being submitted to the journal Microbiome for publication.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from year 1 of the award have provided the important basis for the phase 2 of the work being currently in progress. We will be able to demonstrate in a well-controlled study (where we know precisely dietary compositions and environmental conditions) what are determining factors controlling composition and diversity of fish gut microbiota.
Our findings so far has a significant impact for the academic community and fish feed industry. Results show that the gut microbiota of fish, while influenced by host-derived factors leading to variation between species, is not resistant to alteration within species. Our data indicate that environmental features also influence bacterial community structure, demonstrating plasticity of fish gut microbiota. This knowledge will assist in developing strategies to promote a beneficial gut microbiome for the improvement of health and productivity in farmed fish.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>64BB4266-C9BD-41FA-8F94-64865DDA4A50</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd756eb01374.54729036</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M026531/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E793F7FE-614C-4A45-83A0-BE79B172092C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal &amp; human physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>446B7E7F-04EB-4121-9CC6-9171277E00DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diet &amp; health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5B73146D-6DEF-4D88-BE83-FE7B9DB21D62</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Microbiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
