It has identified three main sets of beneficiaries (i) professional stakeholders working in the energy and social security sectors, including from the public, voluntary and private sectors; (ii) policy-making officials, including civil servants working within the Scottish government and Whitehall, local authority officials, and parliamentarians and their staff; and (iii) the wider public, whose vote will determine the future of Scotland in the referendum. 

An Advisory Board will be appointed at the beginning of the project to ensure opportunities to inform and influence these beneficiaries are fully exploited. 

The project will include a wide range of activities to benefit user groups, including: producing 5 brief, easy-to-read reports, disseminated widely to user groups and posted on our website; convening two practitioner seminars, with senior stakeholders and officials invited to participate; and a range of public-facing events. The latter include a series of informal 'conversations on independence', as part of a series being planned by the Academy of Government at the University of Edinburgh, scheduled to begin in the spring, and a large public conference being planned by the Academy for November 2013, with the aim of examining the Scottish Government's programme for independence, due to be presented in the autumn. These events would involve a range of speakers and research themes, but would be utilised as an opportunity to disseminate the insights and findings from this ESRC project to audiences of engaged citizens and practitioners. As Director of Public Policy for the Academy, the PI is also in discussion with an external partner with a view to organising a series of panels on independence at the 2013 Edinburgh International Book Festival, building on our successful participation in the festival in 2012.

To reach as broad an audience as possible, the PI will also exploit opportunities to disseminate findings via the media, drawing on her extensive experience and contacts. As well as responding to requests for interview, with the support of the University of Edinburgh Press team, she will actively seek opportunities to participate in relevant scheduled programmes, and will write two op ed pieces for broadsheet newspapers. In addition, she will exploit social media, using Twitter and Facebook to publicise events and link to material posted on the website, as well as to provide regular commentary on issues relevant to the project. She will also produce a Blog, which will be linked to the project website. 

Full details of beneficiaries, the Advisory Board, and the planned activities are set out in the Pathways to Impact plan, attached to this submission.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>106695</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborator with Scottish Council on Voluntary Organisations</gtr:description><gtr:id>83A09923-350F-4042-8A83-CEB532AA9F1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public engagement events</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5694cbfccdfab0.59865538-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The SCVO provided links to an extensive network of voluntary organisations across Scotland, helping Nicola broaden the reach of her research.

To Whom It May Concern,

Evaluation for Prof Nicola McEwen

It is difficult to overstate the potential impact of new powers proposed by the Smith
Commission, for social housing in Scotland. Housing policy and legislation is devolved to
Holyrood, but key aspects of the sector's funding and wider role - from Housing Benefit to
energy regulation and efficiency incentives - are reserved to Westminster. The devolution of
further powers in these areas creates the opportunity to address long-running challenges for
Scotland. From the moment that the Smith Commission was announced, influencing the
decision making process has thus been of vital interest to the Scottish Federation of Housing
Associations (SFHA) on behalf of our members, their tenants and our partners in the sector.
There were two main challenges facing the SFHA (and everyone aiming to engage) in the
process to date. These were the compressed and immediate timeframe; and the non-standard
processes in which the Smith Commission and then the UK Government Bill Team writing the
Draft Clauses were operating. Indeed we observed that at times the officials themselves did
not seem to know more than a few days in advance how things might proceed.
This context reveals why Prof Nicola McEwen's expertise and advice was so helpful to the
SFHA. She helped us to see that while the initial processes set out for the creation of new
legislation were not standard, that the government has established methods for undertaking
non-standard legislation. So at each stage, and with each new announcement, Prof McEwen
helped us to interpret and anticipate how the UK and Scottish Government staff tasked with
this work would approach it; and vitally to identify who the key people in this process would be.
This has enabled us to provide written and oral evidence at every stage of the process so far;
and to not just be included in stakeholder engagement by the Bill Team, but to initiate it and
become a key contact for them in creating stakeholder engagement events on housing issues
across Scotland. This meant that we could ensure that the voice of the housing sector was
heard at all of them and that we could use our voice with greater confidence.
As we look forward to the General Election, all of the main parties are promising to deliver the
new powers, but their manifestos show different interpretations of what that will look like,
especially around Housing Benefit. With Prof McEwen's advice, we have been able consider
multiple outcomes, and her briefs are helping us to plan how to influence the stages ahead as
the bill is formally drafted, makes its way through Westminster and is - hopefully - passed,
assented by Holyrood and enacted. Prof McEwen's input on the constitutional aspects of these
developments has been and continues to be invaluable.

Depending on the implications of the election for the Command Paper, we anticipate being
further involved in discussion about devolution of additional powers and hope to draw on Prof
McEwen's services again.

Yours faithfully
Mary Taylor

1. Societal Impact

Opinion polls consistently identified a hunger among the voting public for accessible, impartial and trustworthy information which could help to inform their vote choice. The research and activities supported by this grant enabled me to become one of the leading academic commentators helping to inform public understanding of the issues at stake in the referendum across the UK and globally, as well as crucially helping to inform vote choice among electors within Scotland. 

My research was communicated via print, broadcast and social media, spanning all main UK broadcasters and broadsheets. Highlights include: 

- invited 'op eds' for the Guardian, the Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday;
- prime-time TV appearances, for example, on BBC 1's 'The One Show' (audience c. 5 million), BBC 6 o'clock and 10 o'clock network news (c. 4.5 million), and ITN News at Ten (c.2.5 million);
- participation in radio and TV documentaries in my areas of expertise (energy, welfare, Scottish-UK relations, Scottish party politics);
- the 'presenter's friend' slot for the prestigious BBC Radio 4/5 Live Referendum Results programme and the 'morning after' edition of the Today programme. 

International media interviews reached global audiences of at least in the tens of millions, including major international outlets such as Asahi Shimbun (7.5 million readers) and Xinhua (tens of millions of readers). On social media, I have written 19 research-related blogs, disseminated through the Future UK and Scotland/Centre on Constitutional Change website, amassing a total of 4,949 page views to date. My personal Twitter account, which is used for research dissemination and succinct commentary, has c750 followers. My research outputs and events were also tweeted by the Centre on Constitutional Change channel (2336 followers).

Dissemination through the media went hand in hand with a highly successful and inclusive programme of public events reaching over 2,000 electors in face-to-face meetings (from large, all day conferences to smaller more community-based gatherings) which I planned, led and participated in on behalf of the Future of the UK and Scotland programme. Feedback indicated that 97% participants found that these events helped a lot or a little toward understanding of constitutional issues and informing vote choice. Event feedback also indicated that the impact potential of the events went beyond the participants. Across all the events I led and participated in, 82% said they would discuss the understandings derived from our events with friends, 78% said they'd do so with family members and 52% with work colleagues.

Events included a Saturday workshop in central Edinburgh, which brought c.200 members of the public together with academics and politicians to discuss, debate and learn about the implications of a Yes vote; a similar participative event in Glasgow on the implications of a No vote; and an evening event in Edinburgh which attracted around 120 (mainly) women to discuss the implications of the constitutional debate for women. I organised community events across the country, sometimes after developing partnerships with the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Workers Educational Association Scotland (which helped reach out to normally 'hard to reach' groups, including the unemployed, new immigrants, and recovering addicts) and a variety of local organisations, including several events with the Edinburgh Active Citizens Group. To give a flavour, along with two colleagues from the Centre on Constitutional Change, I organised and participated in an event in a community centre in Killearn village hall, attracting around 115 people from the surrounding villages (in spite of it clashing with one of the major TV leaders' debates!). Some testimonials give an insight into the impact we achieved:

From event attendees at Killearn, August 2014:
&amp;quot;I wish such a presentation could be available to the whole electorate! Much better than the TV debates&amp;quot;
 &amp;quot;We need more meetings like this!&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I learnt more in the 90 minutes of our meeting than in the entire campaign&amp;quot;

Event participant, Tollcross community centre, Edinburgh, August 2014:
&amp;quot;This meeting has changed many of my misgivings and worries, mainly for the future of my children.&amp;quot; 

I also participated in high school Q &amp;amp; A panels and a variety of high profile public events, including at the Scottish Parliament's Festival of Politics, the Edinburgh International Book Festival and 'Aye Write' festival (Glasgow book festival). I made a made a significant contribution to a University of Edinburgh Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), entitled 'Towards Scottish Independence? Understanding the Referendum'. I helped to design the course and participated in live weekly seminars to over 9000 participants, including journalists, diplomats and officials, as well as 'ordinary' members of the public seeking clarity on the referendum issues. The MOOC's 'real time structure' meant I could respond to the dynamics of the debate as it unfolded, and address tricky referendum issues raised by participants.

From a MOOC participant:
&amp;quot;Like everyone else I want to say thank you for this absorbing, illuminating, well-organised course. It was my first MOOC and I didn't know what to expect. What a pleasure to find it so enjoyable, both the very interesting input from the team and the discussions among the course members. I learnt a lot.&amp;quot;

2. Policy Impact

Throughout the course of the fellowship, I engaged with a variety of policy practitioners, informing their understanding of the context, significance and consequences of different proposals constitutional change. I developed partnerships with ACOSVO (Association of Chief Officers of Scottish Voluntary Organisations), the Carnegie Trust, and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA), providing presentations to a variety of third sector leaders on the implications of independence for their organisations, for Scottish democracy and society, and for cross-border cooperation. I met with business leaders, including at the Institute of Directors and Scottish Power, to discuss the implications of the the referendum debate and constitutional change. I organised two practitioner-academic workshops - on the implications of independence for energy and welfare respectively - which I used to disseminate my findings and nurture relations with research users. From January-April 2015, I advised the SFHA on further devolution and its effect on welfare matters and intergovernmental coordination.

Letter from Mary Taylor, Chief Executive of SFHA:
&amp;quot;Prof Nicola McEwen's expertise and advice was so helpful to the SFHA at each stage, and with each new announcement, Prof McEwen helped us to interpret and anticipate how the UK and Scottish Government staff tasked with this work would approach it; and vitally to identify who the key people in this process would be. This has enabled us to provide written and oral evidence at every stage of the process so far; and to not just be included in stakeholder engagement by the Bill Team, but to initiate it and become a key contact for them in creating stakeholder engagement events on housing issues across Scotland. This meant that we could ensure that the voice of the housing sector was heard at all of them and that we could use our voice with greater confidence&amp;quot;

My research also informed deliberation and debate on the implications of Independence and Union among officials, parliamentarians and campaigners, recognised in citations in UK government publications, parliamentary committee reports, campaign material from both Better Together and Yes Scotland, and invitations to provide evidence to parliamentary enquiries. I coordinated and chaired private meetings between academics and officials from the UK and Scottish governments to inform the development of their constitutional documents before and after the referendum. These included a series of meetings on welfare which informed the deliberations and ultimately the report of the Scottish Government's independent expert group on welfare; successive meetings with representatives from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change and Department of Work and Pensions to help inform their respective Scotland Analysis papers - the latter cited my research. I was an invited witness to a variety of parliamentary committees in the Scottish Parliament, House of Commons and House of Lords during 2013-2015, discussing the implications of independence and constitutional change for social security, constitutional politics and intergovernmental relations. I was cited liberally in two recent reports by the House of Lords Constitution Committee. Given the politically contentious subject, the Scottish Parliament committees did not produce reports in the run-up to the referendum campaign, but in recognition of my research and contributions, I was invited to participate in a professional training programme for Scottish parliamentary officials, giving talks on two occasions on intergovernmental relations and constitutional change. Further, I was appointed Adviser to the Scottish Parliament Devolution (Further Powers) Committee in the aftermath of the referendum (Feb-April 2015), giving advice to members on welfare and intergovernmental issues arising from the Smith Commission and the UK Government's proposals for a new devolution settlement for Scotland ('the draft clauses'). 

Letter from Bruce Crawford, MSP
Convenor, Devolution (Further Powers) Committee, Scottish Parliament:
&amp;quot;..thank you for the invaluable support that you have provided to the Devolution (Further Powers) Committee during our recent work considering the draft legislative clauses published by the UK Government. The feedback from Members of the Committee to me has been very appreciative for the support you have provided and I want to put on record my personal appreciation and thanks for the support and commitment you demonstrated in advising the Committee on the draft clauses.&amp;quot;

My work on cross-border relations under different constitutional outcomes has continued to have significant impact, especially in the post-independence referendum environment of constitutional change. I gave oral evidence twice to the House of Lords Constitution Committee, and written evidence, and was cited in their reports; the Committee's report on the Union and Devolution cited me four times, with clear and direct links between this cited evidence and the Committee's own positions and recommendations on the development and structure of the Union (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldselect/ldconst/149/149.pdf). Similarly, the Committee's report on intergovernmental relations (http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/ldconst/146/146.pdf) cited me seventeen times, directly informing their recommendations on the form and practice of UK IGR. Some of these recommendations are reflected in proposed revisions to intergovernmental relations prepared by the joint secretariat of the intergovernmental Joint Ministerial Committee. The Commons Public Administration and Constitution Committee also cited my evidence in their report on IGR. 

I also gave evidence to the Devolution (Further Powers) Committee's inquiry into the 'draft clauses' and subsequent devolution legislation. The Scottish Parliament Information Centre cited my work 8 times in their briefing to MSPs on the proposed new welfare powers (http://www.parliament.scot/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/S4/SB_15-07_The_Smith_Commission_Welfare_Proposals.pdf). I was subsequently appointed adviser to the committee, first on welfare and then later on intergovernmental relations. This advice enhanced parliamentary scrutiny and fed into the committee's highly critical interim report, which led to revisions and improvements to the legislation, especially in relation to the clauses on welfare. Bruce Crawford MSP, the Committee's Convener, acknowledged in a letter the impact of my contribution as the Committee's adviser 'on developing some of the recommendations, especially on tax and welfare, in our interim and final reports on the Scotland Bill, contributing to the improvements that we as a Committee secured in our scrutiny of the bill through its legislative passage.' 

The inadequacies of intergovernmental relations have been exposed by several inquiries, and reforms to the machinery of IGR are in process. I engaged extensively with senior officials, parliamentarians and ministers on this topic, drawing comparative insights to suggest reforms. Most notable to date has been my impact on enhancing the scrutiny of IGR within Scotland, where I conducted a comparative research project commissioned by the Devolution committee, and which was used extensively in their report on enhancing scrutiny over IGR. As adviser, I subsequently helped devise and negotiate a Written Agreement on IGR between the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government (http://www.parliament.scot/20160309_IGR_Agreement3.pdf). In his letter, Bruce Crawford MSP acknowledged that I had been 'integral to the process of drafting and negotiating' the Agreement, adding 'the influence of your research and advisory work can be seen in the content and spirit of the Agreement'. The implementation of this Agreement in the current session of parliament has had a transformative impact on the way the Scottish Government and Parliament interact on IGR issues, strengthening democratic accountability.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FB91E257-0F76-46CC-875F-17BEDC759418</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>553f953fb440b2.99842161</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities
