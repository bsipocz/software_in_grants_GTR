Existing regulations and mitigation measures are based on assumed effects. Lack of information means that the regulations may be either too onerous and recommended mitigation measures may be unnecessary or ineffective. There is a clear need to improve our understanding of how animals perceive and respond to devices and how these responses affect their behaviour, distribution and ultimately fitness.
The RESPONSE project is a multi-disciplinary study focussing on causal links between marine renewable devices (MRD) and changes in the fine-scale distribution and behaviour of marine vertebrates. The overall aim of the project is to identify and quantify actual risk of negative consequences and therefore remove one key layer of uncertainty in the scale of risk to the industry and natural environment. 
The main objectives are to:
1. understand how stakeholders see the risks to the industry and to the environment.
2. measure the fine scale distribution of marine wildlife in high tidal and wave energy sites to understand how seals, cetaceans, birds and 
 large fish use such areas.
3. characterise acoustic, visual and electromagnetic signals that MRDs produce and assess the reactions of marine wildlife to those cues.
4. use the results in habitat preference models to infer zones of influence and avoidance associated with MRDs at both small and large 
 scales.
5. develop effective mitigation methods 

We will achieve these objectives through a set of inter-related sub projects that will:-
1. bring together a UK wide group of regulators, conservation groups and industry to assess the perception of risk to the industry and 
 environment posed by negative interactions with marine wildlife. 
2. use novel, high resolution GPS transmitters for seals and state of the art passive acoustics, active sonar and visual observation techniques 
 for porpoises, seabirds and fish to record details of their habitat use and behaviour in and around operational wave and tidal test sites and 
 an un-developed high energy tide site. These studies will be co-ordinated with FLOWBEC, another NERC/Defra funded project monitoring 
 the physical characteristics of the marine environment at these high energy sites
3. carryout a programme of physical measurements to characterise the outputs of MRDs that have a potential to cause disturbance to marine 
 wildlife. 
4. carry out a series of controlled exposure/behaviour response trials with captive seals and with wild free ranging seals and porpoises. 
5. use visual and acoustic observation data and the operating schedules of existing MRDs to assess the responses of seabirds to MRD 
 operations. 
The results of 1 to 5 will be used to describe the effects of MRDs on individual animals over the short term, i.e. how they react to the stimuli, and over the medium to long term, i.e. how they change their movements and behaviour in response to exposure to the stimuli. These results will be used as direct input to the EBAO project, another NERC/Defra funded project modeling the potential impacts of large scale arrays of MRDs. 
This project will provide a step change in knowledge about the existence and importance of adverse effects of MRDs and provide an ability to predict impacts of</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>see main form</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>182106</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Method demonstrated. However this was for the leading tidal turbine design at the time. That company has now been wound up and the IP bought by another developer with a different turbine design.

This method has the potential to de-risk and accelerate consenting for marine renewable energy devices in the UK and globally where issues of marine mammal - turbine strikes are a consideration

Furthermore significant variation in porpoises in space and time popped out from the experiment and has been a result of interest to the renewables industry and regulators.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9E4370E2-C87F-484C-88C9-01EB69A00FF8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df1b06140199.33050253</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We developed a method to investigate how marine mammals (seals and porpoises) respond to the presence of tidal turbines before they are installed in the sea. 
The work involved playing back the sound of turbines in sites used by high densities of animals and observing their responses. 
For the particular turbine noise presented, seals showed a local response and no response was detected for the porpoises. These results help frame the likely impacts we might see of turbines and the spatial range over which monitoring should occur. 
The methods developed could be used to investigate other industrial impacts where the technologies have yet to be fully developed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings are highly relevant to ongoing monitoring plans both in the UK (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in particular) and further afield by inclusion in IEA Ocean Energy Systems Annex IV programmes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5D4C3845-A03D-46BA-BC75-632632D0CA57</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df193d2f9f40.96195076</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://pure.uhi.ac.uk/portal/files/1810327/Benjamins_et_al_2015_Review_of_marine_megafauna_interactions_with_tidal_stream_environments.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CF02BD4F-529C-44B4-8808-B128649812EF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Harbour porpoise distribution can vary at small spatiotemporal scales in energetic habitats</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/48c2231d221d2b2a19ddee2a27c37c70"><gtr:id>48c2231d221d2b2a19ddee2a27c37c70</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Benjamins S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d446d9da3d3.70595877</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C69AF09C-BE13-4930-801C-43A1088C95C4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Riding the tide: use of a moving tidal-stream habitat by harbour porpoises</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Marine Ecology Progress Series</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/48c2231d221d2b2a19ddee2a27c37c70"><gtr:id>48c2231d221d2b2a19ddee2a27c37c70</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Benjamins S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56df1461a614a6.27439523</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4FAEC9AF-9B6F-4713-9B07-19A215C104C7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Using drifting passive echolocation loggers to study harbour porpoises in tidal-stream habitats</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Endangered Species Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3d65d6e41376ce11e21a578f6ab42ac2"><gtr:id>3d65d6e41376ce11e21a578f6ab42ac2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilson B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545752c942c665.14092549</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C423803A-670C-4E9F-B231-A211C7AA01E6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Harbour seals avoid tidal turbine noise: Implications for collision risk</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Applied Ecology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/38056fa9fb897760e5f68f1bb4ca1772"><gtr:id>38056fa9fb897760e5f68f1bb4ca1772</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hastie G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6ff7f903122.03000626</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/J004367/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>790AD28C-6380-4025-83C2-6881B93C4602</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal behaviour</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF2ECBC3-83AC-4763-B527-27A84805F0F9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BCCE8AB-CBA5-4D28-9682-5236FE9D0668</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy - Marine &amp; Hydropower</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
