In Ethiopia, TB is one of the major causes of adult death, affecting the lives of many people and health service coverage is poor, resulting in low case detection. 

Recently, proactive approaches canvassing the community to identify individuals through house-to-house visits combined with health education have been shown to increase TB case detection. We have shown that village-based health extension workers (HEW) in Ethiopia increase the accessibility to diagnosis and treatment in the Southern Region. HEWs are part of the Ethiopian Health Service Extension Programme (HSEP), which aims to improve access to health services by providing basic health packages at community level. In the new TB package, HEWs identify individuals with symptoms suggestive of TB, collect and prepare tests from sputum and supervisors with motorbikes link the HEWs to the diagnostic laboratories and treatment is provided and supervised at home or at the local health post. The package has doubled the number of cases identified and increased treatment completion, confirming that bridging the gap between services and the community is crucial to increase uptake. 

The approach has considerable support by health providers and donors and has generated interest for adoption by the HSEP. However, moving from an independent-project to a package integrated within the system is a process that requires many steps for adoption. Clearly there is a need to have a process to formalise the debate to consider the adoption of a community-based TB package and we therefore propose to:

1. Engage health and financial policy decision makers at district, regional, national and international level to discuss the process of policy development in Ethiopia,

2. Engage policy makers and programme managers to set objectives and agreeing monitoring and impact assessment needs for the TB package and 

3. Document the process considering the implementation of the package within the HSEP as a case study. 

Methods: 
The process will start by preparing packages of documentation describing concepts and research findings; systematic reviews available; summaries of findings presented in ways accessible to political, health service and user audiences and users; descriptions of mechanisms to guide policy change and discussion guides with issues that need debate. We will organise a variety of discussion platforms of all stakeholders including focus groups discussions (FGDs) and in depth interviews (IDIs) with Ministry of Health (MoH), beneficiaries and programme implementers to highlight barriers to accessing diagnosis and treatment; staff from the Health Bureau and the department of finance and economic development to discuss the package, its advantages, disadvantages and costs; barriers, enablers and implementation modalities of best practice that could be useful to the community and IDIs with high level policy makers, the WHO and funders to discuss policy formulation. The process will culminate in a national meeting to discuss the package and eventual policy development.

Learning by doing
The barriers for accessing services are not specific to TB and similar approaches are needed for other health problems and Ethiopia is desperately looking for interventions to improve health service delivery for rural communities. The process of adopting a new package could be used to build capacity to review and develop policies and as a knowledge transfer platform for similar packages within the HSEP. The process proposed would be a catalyst for capacity building in decision making, the use of research evidence for policy guidance and a case study on how evidence can inform policy development in a Sub-Saharan country.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The findings of our main ESRC-DFiD funded studies were presented at global and regional conferences, posters and papers and our team was strategically placed to influence debates in policy and practice in institutions with leading roles in TB policy and practice. We used the data generated by our project's and other WHO-sponsored studies to engage in policy dialogue and data was incorporated into discussions of evidence for WHO Scientific Advisory Committees which resulted in new international policies (see for example http://www.who.int/tb/advisory_bodies/stag/en/index.html). 

However, further studies to monitor if the new approaches improved access to diagnosis then highlighted the need to bring diagnosis closer to the patient. Over the last three years, we have therefore explored approaches to enhance TB case detection by addressing the barriers identified and provide an opportunity to bring services closer to poor and vulnerable groups. One of the packages was tested in the Southern Region of Ethiopia, where village-based Health Extension Workers (HEWs) facilitate access to diagnosis, reduce travel and the time taken to seek diagnosis and opportunity costs. The package is highly appreciated by the community and has doubled the number of cases diagnosed. The intervention is embedded in the local Health Service Extension Programme and has a highly equitable ethos that follows the principles of primary health care. 

Currently, we envision that there is a strong potential to make changes in the national Ethiopian system to identify cases of TB and that similar changes may be implemented at a later stage in Nigeria. Despite all this progress and its high national and international recognition, changing a health system is a protracted process intersected with many other health, political and financial priorities and agendas. We therefore submit that changing the system requires a platform for the formal process of discussion by all stakeholders and a structured consideration of the integration of the package into the health system. 

The process proposed will follow a participatory approach, engaging stakeholders at all feasible levels, providing factual information to enrich the discussion and organising formal discussions on issues critical for policy development. Although the process of developing guidelines at international level has become more structured and formalised in recent years, the same process is still fragmented and poorly documented in Sub-Saharan countries. We therefore propose to learn by doing and along the way document the process to facilitate the path for other interventions in the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82474</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dr Datiko, Ethiopian Director of TB REACH was invited to contribute to the Ethiopian concept note for the GFATM application</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>045BE695-877A-4EA7-8798-A32405C848BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Datiko, Ethiopian Director of TB REACH was invited to contribute to the Ethiopian concept note for the GFATM application; to describe the main components to be proposed and identify priority areas for community based diagnosis and treatment of TB.

In this package, community-based health extension workers (HEWs)that belong to the Ethiopian Health Extension Program (HEP) were trained to identify individuals with symptoms of TB and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment at the village level. HEWs are female salaried workers selected by the community who undertake training to deliver 16 packages of basic health care at the village level. There are two HEWs per village and they implement these packages by staffing the local health post and frequently visiting the village households. Once trained, HEWs were able to prepare sputum smears for examination, liaise with a network of supervisors that transported specimens to the local laboratories and supervised the treatment of patients confirmed to have TB. 

After an initial proof of concept, the approach was expanded to a larger number of villages to provide services to a 3 million population. After four years of delivery, the number of cases had doubled in the intervention areas and treatment completion had increased from 72 to 93%, with more women being diagnosed with TB. 

The ESRC funding aimed to facilitate streamlining our research finding into national policies. We highlighted our research findings to national and international policy makers (e.g. parliamentarians from UK and Canada and the World Health Assembly), funders (e.g. the GFATM, TB REACH), politicians of the Ministry of Health and program implementers including the district, Regional and National TB control programs. We prepared accessible materials to summarize and share information and experiences with stakeholders and organised meetings to facilitate discussion of the perception, advantages and disadvantages of the approach and compared its findings to other approaches. 

All together we generated advocacy and momentum to convince the NTP managers that the approach should be incorporated within the operational activities of their control programs. We supported the National TB control program to request the GFATM a significant fund allocation to expand the approach to other regions. 

Our approach eventually influenced the country to adopt the approach within its national TB control program. 

Similar projects funded by TB REACH and led by LSTM with partners in Ethiopia (REACH), Nigeria (Zankli Medical Center) and Yemen (Sana'a University) were highlighted at a special meeting of the 47th Union World Conference on Lung Health in Liverpool, where we had an opportunity to discuss the process of incorporating suitable research findings into policies. 

Please notice that some activities were conducted through informal discussions to inform policy makers.

Reaching the missing 3 million. TB REACH funds projects that focus specifically on finding and diagnosing cases of tuberculosis in the most vulnerable, hardest to reach regions of the world.

Community-driven results. Grants from TB REACH are much smaller compared to the Global Fund-the maximum funding amount per project is $1 million-which encourages community-led initiatives to apply. These small projects can then be scaled up, and some are even adopted by their respective country's Ministry of Health for further expansion.

Using unique, innovative approaches, many of the programs funded through TB REACH are utilising new technologies and methods of case detection to ensure they are reaching as many people and diagnosing as many cases as possible.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56debb3683c070.89236968</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.results-resultats.ca/en/action-info/tb-using-innovation-end-global-epidemic/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>6.

Implementation of innovative community TB cares interventions: 

Additional 8.4million is requested for three years to detect and treat 32,352 additional TB cases. In Ethiopia HEWs of the HEP in the community currently identify and refer presumptive cases to diagnostic units. The country target is for the HEWs to increase the referral of presumptive TB cases to more than 50% of cases attending diagnostic centres. In the new approaches, HEWs will be more actively involved in the diagnosis and treatment of the cases in the community. This activity will be additional to the conventional DOT centre activities and will serve as a backbone to increase the number of cases detected. It is expected that engaging HEWs in community-based TB prevention and control efforts would increase their contribution to smear-positive case notification rate of 65%43. The community HEWs will provide services for 65% of smear positive cases notified. This would mainly contribute to increasing case finding and reverse the declining trend in TB case detection. 

The TB REACH project implemented in southern Ethiopia had a high impact on TB case finding by addressing the main barriers to seeking diagnosis and making the services accessible to the community. In this application, the country targeted increasing case finding through strengthening the existing health system and implementing high impact intervention such as the interventions illustrated by the TB REACH project in phased manner. The country therefore, plans to scale up the TB REACH CTBC intervention packages in four major regions (SNNPR, Oromia, Amhara and Tigray) of the country. These regions are of predominantly rural population, high burden of TB and a declining case finding. Additional funding is required to implement the community-based approach and enhance case finding in these high burden areas. The interventions will require; strengthening the health centre-health post links; improve the community awareness of TB and of the service and the implementation of the interventions by actively engaging HEWs and the health development army. This would require budget additional budget amount $8.4 million with community-based approaches and selected interventions will be implemented in a phased manner. In the first phase of the grant, NTP will continue to sustain and expand the interventions already implemented in the Southern Region of Ethiopia (to better characterize and document the TB epidemic in the whole Region), learn from the interventions and monitor its impact) and scale up the interventions to at least 10 zones. In the second phase, and based on the lesson learned during the initial implementation of the interventions, the approach will be further scaled up in the regions selected, to include 25 new zones and to consider expanding to the remaining regions of the country. The key interventions include strengthening the basic packages implemented by the NTP. Under this concept note period, the CCM-E request $8.4million request for implementation of the above innovative community TB case interventions of which $1.62million used for familiarization and training of HCWs $1.62 million, $1.49 million for implementation cost (district level program review, air time for Key ACSM activities),$2 procurement of Non - medical items (Motorbikes, reagents, fuel and maintenance), $3.3 million for procurement of medical items like cartridges, ILED microscopes, experts). With this approach over all additional 32,352 TB cases will be detected and put on treatment.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56decd3fdfcd81.33724066</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/portfolio/country/?loc=ETH</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Leaflet from the Stop TB Partnership highlights the project achievements</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3E771AD2-9457-4CC5-B99B-E91B9D64D925</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Brief quote:
