Histories</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008378/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In a British context, and with significant exceptions, WWI still focuses largely on the white British armed forces active on the Western Front. While it is possible to subject the events of 1914-18 to disinterested and objective historical inquiry, the commemorative landscapes and rituals created after 1918, and reaffirmed each year in the UK and on the Western Front, tend to prevent a broader understanding of WWI as a global conflict that has continuing relevance for all communities in an increasingly cosmopolitan British society. This includes those for whom the Western Front, and the conventional British narratives associated with it, have limited significance. Many Indians fought on the Western Front, but people from different parts of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, including Ukraine, Russia, and Poland are likely to focus more strongly on the fallout from the collapse of the Russian Empire 1917-22, and the subsequent emergence of new nations in central and eastern Europe after 1918. People of the Balkan states may be more interested in the post-1912 wars which essentially led to Yugoslavia, the fall of the Habsburg monarchy and the emergence of a stronger Greece. Turkey's participation in WWI led to the destruction of the Ottoman Sultanate and the creation of the modern Republic of Turkey. The Irish have yet a further perspective on these years.

The centrality of WWI to British identity has been reaffirmed by the UK government's ambitious &amp;pound;60 million programme to mark the centenary in 2014-18. The explicit objective is to remind the next generation 'that the First World War is not ancient history but a shared history that unites our country'. What of the many communities which have settled in Britain during the 20th century? Are they (intentionally or unintentionally) excluded? Some families have lived in Britain for several generations but do not necessarily feel any sense of engagement with previous commemorative events.

The proposed Centre aims to idntify and facilitate imaginative democratic community action and engagement around the memories and narratives of the period 1914-18 within the diverse communities which make up contemporary British Society. Initially the Centre will take advantage of its location and work with three, large cosmopolitan cities in the English East Midlands region: Nottingham, Leicester and Derby. These three cities have distinctive but comparable industrial heritages, and through the 20th Century experienced sustained immigration from all parts of Europe, the Commonwealth and elsewhere. From this foundation, and utilizing community networks, we aim to expand our community partnerships to achieve a national reach.

The Centre will be led by a cross-disciplinary network of academics from across the Arts and Humanities, the Social Sciences and the Information Technologies. The University of Nottingham and its partners in the Centre have a strong track record of working with community groups and our key mechanisms of engagement will include a comprehensive programme of community-focused events (themed roadshows, research surgeries, talks and training) co-ordinated by an experienced Community Liaison officer. Access to research expertise will be facilitated by two funding schemes: (i) a Community Challenge Fund to support community groups to gain access to training, facilities and expertise to assist the development of community-led programmes and support the development of bids to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) schemes; and (ii) a Research Development Fund, aimed at extending the potential of a community-led HLF project or funding follow-up activities to further develop a completed HLF project. Mechanisms of engagement through events, and the funding schemes, will encourage fresh approaches to collaborations through the involvement of community theatre practitioners, community film makers and the novel use of technology through the UoN's digital research centres (e.g. Horizon).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposal is for a 'Centre for Hidden Histories of the First World War' that will highlight the impact and subsequent legacies of the war on diverse communities within Britain whilst critically re-assessing their processes of collective remembrance and commemoration. Our primary aim is to develop new and imaginative ways of remembering and commemorating the WWI period, which are genuinely inclusive and reflect the complex and varied nature of British society in the 21st century. Drawing on the opportunities presented by the centenary of WWI, we will initiate new forms of community action and engagement around the memories and narratives of this period. The programme will focus initially on Nottingham, Leicester and Derby, the three large, ethnically mixed, cosmopolitan industrial and manufacturing centres of the English East Midlands. From these cities we will seek to expand the programme activities in conjunction with local community groups, who will be invited to co-design and co-produce the research, into a wider national programme.

As a community-focused project, the proposed programme is inherently geared towards knowledge exchange and impact. The Centre aims to enable community groups, with or without prior experience of research, to have greater engagement with academics. The three year programme is designed to deliver a direct and immediate impact upon the individuals within community groups and should enable them to: 

- formulate research questions, develop methodologies and access sources more easily
- learn how to access research expertise and facilities more effectively 
- develop skills in historical research and be able to conduct research across a broad spectrum of topics
- learn innovative research techniques such as crowd sourcing (with input from Computer Sciences)
- gain skills in recording data appropriately, presenting findings and creating research resources
- hone experience in initiating, organising and delivering community projects

In addition to community groups the programme offers an opportunity to have a positive impact on non-university organisations such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, museums, libraries and archives through the development of new links to communities (and potentially new audiences and users), new knowledge and understanding of the holdings and sites cared for by these organisations and an increased capacity in mobilising community groups and academics to participate in future collaborative research projects.

The programme will also impact upon how schools and teachers approach the teaching of history relating to the contested histories of different community groups, cultural memory and heritage.

Another group of more indirect beneficiaries are respondents drawn into community research projects whose testimonies are solicited as part of oral history data gathered by the researcher group: respondents, often a generation older than those interviewing them, are generally glad to have their knowledge, opinions and memories taken seriously and captured as part of a research process.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>808089</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Multi panelled embroidered tapestry depicting images representing the involvement of Sikhs to WW1</gtr:description><gtr:id>45DCA499-E384-40F6-B526-2BEF9A901612</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Empowerment of Sikh ladies from Leicester Gurdwara

Findings include details on Leeds 'alien' restrictions, names of internees, location mapping, local newspapers and official records research and cultural analyses of the overall oeuvre of internee Paul Cohen-Portheim. German language sources include, among others, memoirs and surviving camp magazines. It was also established that there is some local memory of the camp in Wakefield and that some residents have retained artefacts from the period. 

Unlike Lofthouse Park, Ruhleben Camp in Spandau has many surviving documents and a solid research base as far as the British internees are concerned (project member Matthew Stibbe is a Ruhleben and internment expert). We liaised and also met with descendants of internees who had already researched their individual family histories. Progress has been made to develop previously underrepresented colonial narratives relating to Irish, West Indian and African internees. We were also able to create a personal profile for an English internee whose correspondence is held at Spandau City Archive. Currently, we are gaining further insights into local responses to internment and the camp on the German side. The Ruhleben section of the Liddle Collection is being revisited, among others to create an inclusive narrative of musical production and study the literary production of internees.
Claudia Sternberg, lead researcher on this project has engaged with curatorial and critical heritage studies as well as with forms of co-production - both from a practical and theoretical point of view. This is a new area for her, although there is some overlap with her long-standing interest in cultural memory studies and ethnographic enquiry. Furthermore, she has explored concepts that might support her aspiration to 'decentre' WWI commemorative practice (such as family display/legacies, sociology of the unmarked, agonistic memory, palimpsestic space/deep mapping, translocal, civilianness etc.).

Working on this project as well as for Legacies of War at the University of Leeds has resulted in observations that reach beyond the question of internment. On various occasions, Sternberg has presented on the differences between British and German (war) memory cultures and the implication these differences have for the centenary and other contemporary concerns, especially the representation and understanding of European integration.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c292a74fd027.40715014-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Sternberg led the project on the ground, acted as mentor to the community partners and oversaw the delivery of the project outputs</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, community liaison support, impact support, access to Centre's network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Threshold Studios</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Centre for Hidden Histories Key Partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>F53BA7F7-4BAE-4598-BA2D-8F03CC3F6DF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Completed public engagement events with key partners:

Barling trained undergraduate students from across media and film disciplines at Middlesex University on how to transform research in the archive into content for audio podcasts and a documentary. 
'Hidden Heroes' the 16 minute film will be entered into the student category of film festivals in 2017 and is available on the CHH Youtube feed.
The film has already been shown publically, most recently at the Stratford Public Library in East London to commemorate the Battle of the Somme.
Students are using this film as a vehicle to secure employment.
Hidden Heroes engaged students right through the educational chain from primary to undergraduate level.
Primary School children were introduced to the project through the pop-up exhibition by secondary school students who had prepared artefacts and games to engage these younger students.
Some secondary schools have held assemblies organised and run by students. Some have organised events for parents to visit the exhibition.
Two local MPs visited the exhibits in schools Enfield (Joan Ryan) and Tottenham (David Lammy).
 A symposium was held at Middlesex University which included school children and teachers to explore the need for a more diverse approach to exploring our national story.
A survey was conducted which helps us understand the type of information that appeals to schoolchildren who attended the pop-up exhibition. Survey over 400 children and their teachers.
The main static exhibition was held at Bruce Castle Museum in Tottenham. Its popularity meant it was extended beyond Black History Month in 2015 to June 2016.
A number of public events including workshops and talks were held at the museum.
The static exhibition and pop-up exhibition both received strong coverage in the local press and on regional BBC London radio.

The central aims of the collaboration were to facilitate the museum volunteers' engagement with research, to offer additional training, and establish a firm and fruitful partnership between our institutions. Over the course of the year long project, 14 individual research projects were carried out in the museum archives and explored hitherto unused (in some cases uncatalogued) sources, and which produced the rich tapestry of personal narratives explored in the exhibition. The War Beyond the Western Front focused on the Oxf and Bucks battalions' experiences of the Italian, Balkan, Middle Eastern and Russian campaigns. It revealed a fascinating and intimate history of the First World War, one that is also lucidly illustrated the global dimensions of the First World War and our own role therein. 

The exhibit had three interconnecting sections covering: The research projects conducted by the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum and Brookes volunteers and that explore personal histories found in the museum archives; a collection of artefacts on loan from the museum that are such impressive material legacies of the war; and a series of 28 stereoscopic pictures converted into 3D anaglyphs that reinvented these remarkable images and made them accessible to a wider audience. Ultimately, the exhibit aimed to be an informal, engaging space in which to rediscover a remarkable perspective on the history of the First World War, and to encourage a conversation about what it means to us during the centenary commemorations and beyond.

Evaluation Data
To capture some the exhibition's reach and affect, visitors were encouraged to complete a brief survey left out on the information table, and the 59 responses received offer truly rewarding results. In terms of overall experience, 76% rated their visit as &amp;quot;excellent&amp;quot; and 85% would &amp;quot;definitely&amp;quot; recommend it to friends. Most importantly though given our central aim to uncover hidden histories and augment current perceptions, a remarkable 76% fed back that their visit had &amp;quot;definitely&amp;quot; &amp;quot;added to how your think about the First World War&amp;quot; and offered a multitude of written comments on how the personal narratives and 3D images in particular have impacted their understanding of the War.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c293d569fdd2.23878354-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Georgescu led the project, liaised with the community partner and oversaw the delivery of the project outputs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, community liaison support, impact support, access to Centre's network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Away From the Western Front</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Away from the Western Front</gtr:description><gtr:id>DDC803C0-2DA9-4AA9-8DA8-D0CB52AC4C5F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;The Centre supported Away from the Western Front, an HLF project that brings together communities interested in engaging with the heritage of the First World War as it related to places far away from the Western Front, often fighting alongside troops from the former British Empire, especially those in the Indian Army which recruited from India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nepal.

The overall mission is to recuperate, package and disseminate under-researched evidence of participation in the war effort and its aftermaths by British Empire people of non-European origin. 

An objective is therefore to uncover a historical that will be appreciated and sustained by Britain's diverse communities and future generations - including what happened to empire people of non-European origin immediately after the war. 

A further objective is, through dissemination, to share heritage stories of contributions made as a legacy by non-European origin empire people to the war effort.

 This project will result in an articulate and well researched publication complete with case studies, background historical information, explanatory context, interpretative analysis, photographs/images/pictures.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c29ec7be6955.82143505-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Professor Chapman led the project, liaised with the community partner and oversaw the delivery of the project outputs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, community liaison support, impact support, access to Centre's network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Psychology Nottingham</gtr:department><gtr:description>Finnish Civil War</gtr:description><gtr:id>F1EFEB16-B808-413C-BA46-8DBD67CEE5C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;CHH has sponsored a collaboration between Dr Nigel Hunt (The University of Nottingham) and the Finnish Saturday School in the East Midlands.

There is relatively little information available in the English language, and the aim is to fill this gap. The key outcome will be a website about the Finnish civil war. 

The other main aim is to help the younger members of the community develop skills. These will include learning how to construct the website and adding appropriate material to it; researching archives, magazines, journals and books in order to extract and use appropriate information; working with museum staff to obtain archival information; and conducting and analysing interview material.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c29d9a10c5b9.51110240-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Hunt led the project, liaised with the community partners and oversaw the delivery of the outputs</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, community liaison support, impact support, access to Centre's network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ReelMCR</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Beyond the Race Riots</gtr:description><gtr:id>A06DC769-FA27-444A-9518-73FC8301FAB9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;The group was supported to research and collate all available source materials about the 1919 race riots with a particular bias to events in the North of England, this included material sourced for the film project funded in collaboration with UCL&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b260138b62.50118051-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner conducted the research and delivered the project outputs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, access to Centre's network</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nottingham Trent University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Arts and Humanities</gtr:department><gtr:description>Coal Controversies</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE9FEFF7-81C8-468E-BF46-DF409A40538A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;CHH sponsored a collaboration between Dr Natalie Braber (Nottingham Trent University), community historian, Dr David Amos and Minds2Minds Education. and There are several outcomes for this project. By the end of the project volunteers should be expected to have increase knowledge of a matter of local interest, involving one of the staple industries of the region, resulting from World War One. The treatment of German miners and the owner of the mine who was seen to collaborate with Germans during the War and the resulting effects after the end of the War. This will be done through historical researching, producing a semi-academic journal article / booklet and improved skills and knowledge using interactive websites and social media. 

In academic terms, the project will result in a journal article for a historical journal examining the history of Harworth Colliery, Arnold Lupton and the First World War.

There will also be an 'end of project seminar / display' to discuss and show some of the findings from the project, the quality of the research conducted and its importance in the field of study and its presentation. 

The production of associated digital articles on a mining heritage website and various social media sites to ensure the longevity of the project.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c299345af793.12366119-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Braber and Dr Amos carried out the research, liaised with the community partner and oversaw the delivery of the outputs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, community liaison support, impact support, access to Centre's network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ruskin College Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hidden History of the Labour Corps in Britain</gtr:description><gtr:id>D5B44748-C7E2-40E5-AD79-195F5E465BDF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;CHH has sponsored a collaboration between Dr Lee Humber (Ruskin College) and disability advocacy group, My Life, My Choice.

The more specific and easily measurable ones are listed below, while more general outcomes - such as the enhanced confidence and broadened social and academic horizons of participants - will be evidenced through the quality of the final public presentations and of the video diary and any other web-based materials the research group produces. Specific outcomes include: 
1 To commemorate the military, economic and political contributions of people with learning disabilities during WWI. To celebrate their wartime heritage. This will be achieved through:
I. Video diary published on social media
II. Exhibition/Dissemination events: in Oxford and at Liverpool Hope University
III. Published, co-produced popular and academic historical papers 
2 Empowering a group commonly excluded from an academic research process - people with learning disabilities - to explore a hidden history and disseminate and validate the materials they discover.

A one day public workshop to mark Black History Month at the Imperial War Museum on Saturday 15th October was also convened (http://hiddenhistorieswwi.ac.uk/uncategorized/2016/10/impact-black-history-month-world-war-i-workshop-at-the-iwm-15-october-2016/). 

The project has engaged community groups and individuals in the process of filmmaking, equipping them with technical, production and story telling skills that will improve their education, training and employment opportunities.
The segment of the film has been created is planned to be the first stage of a much larger project - a full length feature film. In conjunction with community partner REELmcr, which has had several projects funded by Heritage Lottery Fund, the applicants will make an application for funding from Heritage Lottery Fund to make the full-length film. 
Both the short segment and long film will be distributed regionally and nationally through live and digital screenings, film festivals; Centre For Hidden Histories' events and partners.

The event began with 2-3 min presentations from 8 speakers, including academics, military professional, museum archivists, creative artist, and community project leaders. Then there was a guided round-table discussion among these 8 panellists, chaired by Dr Santanu Das, around particular challenges being faced, approaches being developed and advances being made in making the FWW memory more multi-racial and diverse. This will be followed by an hour of questions and discussion among the 40 people invited who are involved in similar projects across the country and from different backgrounds. 

The Centre suported the project with funding to record the event professionally and for the recording to be transferred on to a format to share it widely.

In addition to the focus of examination mentioned above, the students were guided in questioning differences and similarities between the period of the First World War and today when it comes to the position and treatment of foreigners such as immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and the development and maintenance of British values in times of conflict, terrorist attack and war.

This assisted them in broadening and deepening their historical and social knowledge and developing and honing their research and dissemination skills, and it helped them and their fellow students to identify with historical personalities and events in order to gain a greater understanding of past and present.

Thus, the project brought to life a hidden history of integration and segregation, and made it relevant for young contemporary audiences through involvement, collaboration and dissemination, leaving a legacy in terms of experiences and learning materials that can be applied in future education and training.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b825d97cc8.29996797-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner conducted the research and delivered the project outputs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, access to Centre's network</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Recognize Black Heritage &amp; Culture CIC</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Recognize Black Heritage and Culture</gtr:description><gtr:id>0CCD9B5B-1373-4F89-832D-FCFD8CB7E96B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;The Centre supported the group as they delivered a presentation and screening event opened to the general public in two locations.

As a longer lasting legacy and outcome of the event and the revelations that will be made, attendees were asked to complete postcards and sound-bites, which were posted on the Recognize website, along with signposts to encourage further learning relating to the diverse cultural memories of the period where our collective histories will be re-told and commemorated as part of a more complex tapestry of Black history in WW1. &amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b67b481221.30037993-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner conducted the research and delivered the project outputs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, access to Centre's network</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Derby</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Derbyshire Parks in Wartime</gtr:description><gtr:id>46ACCC26-03A2-4C04-9DB3-1297231ABF3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;CHH has funded a collaborartive partnership between Professor Paul Elliott (The University of Derby) and Spiral Arts, a community arts organisation. The key output has been a banner made from textiles which captures some of the results of the historical research on Derby and its green spaces during the First World War. This was designed by Spiral Arts with assistance from the project historians Mark Knight and Paul Elliott, and co-produced with community volunteers.

An exhibition took place in the Derby Arboretum lodges in the summer of 2016 which featured the textile banner as its centrepiece and also presented the results of the research into Derby parks and green spaces during WW1 undertaken by community volunteers with assistance from Mark Knight and Paul Elliott. The research was presented using information boards and other media and materials.

Spiral Arts wrote website reports summarising the results of the project. 

Public lectures and other events led by Mark Knight, Paul Elliott, members of Spiral Arts and community researchers presented the findings of the research in a variety of forums. 

Community volunteers and Spiral Arts have developed a new set of skills and knowledge which they will be able to utilise in other ways in the future.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c297628a8ee7.13115734-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Professor Elliott led the project, oversaw the delivery of the outputs and mentored the community partner.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, community liaison support, impact support, access to Centre's network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nottingham City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Centre for Hidden Histories Key Partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>A455DE3F-B34F-4FC8-8E1C-543A9D702674</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Completed public engagement events with key partners:

The public were able to examine and interact with the displays (the textile banner had flaps with more information and pictures beneath). The project provided a valuable and enjoyable experience for our students of working with heritage, arts and community groups, experienced academics and the general public to bring history to new audiences.

The students negotiated their own specialised projects as a contribution to the main venture and also helped to design, research and produce the textile banner and information boards. They chose to focus on WW1 memorial parks of south Derbyshire and allotments and food production on the home front. Their research findings and information banners were presented at the Derby University Learning and Teaching Conference at Buxton (4 July 2016) and subsequently formed part of the exhibition in the Orangery at the Derby Arboretum. This was launched on 21 August 2016 as part of the 'Lark in the Park' event, which included a speech from local councillor Jangir Khan praising their work. Stuart, one of the students, also gave a speech explaining the rationale for his information board and answered questions from the public audience.

These included five local schools (Markeaton Primary, Rosehill Infants, St Mary's Primary, Griffe Field Primary and Arboretum Primary), a young mums group and an over 50s group from QUAD. The well dressings were themed around Derby Green Spaces and the home front using information derived from the academic lead and project volunteers and exhibited at location in the city centre: D&amp;eacute;da, Derby Central Library, Derby Local Studies Library, Derby Cathedral and Derby Tourist Information Centre, the QUAD and the Derby Arboretum.
The well-dressing trail was launched on Saturday 25 June 2016 in the Orangery at Derby Arboretum by Deputy Mayor John Whitby and blessed by Canon Missioner Elizabeth Thomson from Derby Cathedral who described the Well Dressing trail as 'the green heart in Derby's historic spaces'. The well dressings were displayed until Sunday 3 July. 
The well dressing art is unique to Derbyshire. Traditionally well dressing frames are soaked in the local river before being packed with clay. A design is marked out onto the clay and then each section is carefully covered with individual flower petals, leaves, seeds, coffee beans, feathers and stones to complete the design.
Jenny Anthony, Creative Arts Director at Spiral Arts commented that:
'We have thoroughly enjoyed working on this project with the University of Derby, we have found it very interesting to research about the parks history 100 years ago.

The interview lasted about 35 minutes and focussed upon the use of public parks and green spaces during the First World War in Derby. It was timed to coincide with public lecture that Prof Elliott gave on the same subject the next day at the Quad in Derby, and helped to promote this.

During the interview, Prof Elliott outlined the ethos of the Centre for Hidden Histories before going on to answer questions about the impact of the War upon Derby culture and society and the role of parks. He emphasised how wide the audience was that we were hoping to reach and also provided examples of some of the projects already under way. Andy Potter asked about some of Professor Elliott's findings and took a very keen interest in the project, including work that he had done on the role of Rolls Royce during the War and also the ways in which the War was commemorated in Derby, including the presentation of guns and other memorabilia.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d865c4e917c9.31351177</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nottinghamshire's War Memorials</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>165D1A51-C63A-46C4-833C-88F59294A9D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The PI gave a talk on Memorialising the First World War to the Nottingham Civic Society</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c180e605a8d3.08653113</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reflection Workshop: Southern Voices</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2DD15746-A3B2-4072-842D-4DB5ADDD8DE1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Centre Co-ordinator held a reflective discussion with an HLF funded group and developed plans for collaboration</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d86fd62aa084.08642065</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>German Collaboration Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>617A41EC-C739-409E-B5E1-72F99201E631</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Centre Co-ordinator participated in a working group to plan collaborative work on the subject of Germans in Britain during the war</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d872cda79a59.95599936</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Film Screening: All Quiet on the Western Front</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E4265556-07D3-4C17-BBD4-5E438E97C20E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Centre hosted a screening of the film in Nottingham followed by an expert panel disucssion</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c17d888e0d22.19207888</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hiddenhistorieswwi.ac.uk/uncategorized/2016/10/impact-film-screening-of-all-quiet-on-the-western-front/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Coalition of Sikh Organisations, Malaysia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>821455CD-ACD0-48B4-B1B7-5D908B997A01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of the Centre's post-doctoral bursary holders gave an introduction to my project on World War I Malaysian Sikh participation and a brief introduction in to collecting informal/oral histories</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d869c13ac523.61441673</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AHRC Connected Communities Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6BB53739-3A9B-4028-AC59-CDCF5A8FB2EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Jonathan Coope participated in the symposium on 'Utopias, Futures and Temporalities: critical considerations for social change', held at Bristol Zoo, 19-20 May 2015.
