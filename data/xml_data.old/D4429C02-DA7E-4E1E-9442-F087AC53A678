Overview 
 This project involves the design, execution, and application of high temperature and high pressure laboratory experiments to understand the isotope geochemistry of natural mineral samples. Specifically, this research will explore Si- and O-isotope geochemistry of igneous rocks and minerals - including detrital zircon - with three integrated objectives. This first involves systematic experimental work to quantify Si isotope equilibrium fractionation among co-existing minerals at igneous temperatures, including zircon, quartz, and feldspars. Second, these experiments will be used as a stepping stone to interpret Si- and O- isotope geochemistry of whole rock and mineral samples. Finally, the project will focus specifically on applying the results of experiments and natural, in-context, samples to detrital zircon samples to decipher the environments of crystallization. Zircons older than 4 billion years represent a key target for application because rocks from this time period are either sparse or altogether absent. This work will therefore result in new knowledge about the environments and conditions that may have prevailed on the earliest Earth. 

Intellectual merit
 This research is intellectually meritorious because it will result in: (i) the first published experimental data for Si isotope fractionation for igneous minerals and will fill a key gap in knowledge that will enable researchers to understand Si isotopes in igneous rocks on firmer ground; (ii) a systematic comparison of the possible co-variation of O- and Si- isotopes in natural rocks and minerals; (iii) and the first in-situ data for Si isotopes in zircon, which will be investigated along with O-isotopes. Silicon isotopes in zircon will offer a new way to explore crustal evolution from the Hadean onwards. When coupled with oxygen isotope work, these two systems could lead to yield new ways to peer into sedimentary cycling and to explore early Earth magmas from before the existence of the known sedimentary or igneous rock record. 

Broader impacts
 The broader impacts of this project come from the training of undergraduate and graduate students in high temperature experimental techniques and crystal synthesis, and isotope analysis. The practical training on these instruments will result in a broad skillset, highly applicable to many areas in the geosciences. The students will also have the opportunity to attend and network at national and international scientific conferences. As part of the broader impacts of this grant, we will also host high school science teachers from the surrounding Rochester area to introduce them to the technology and the science we undertake in the Early Earth and Experimental Geochemistry Laboratory at Rochester. These 2-3 day summer workshops expose science teachers to cutting edge science and technology and data that they can take back into their classrooms. Finally, at St Andrews, the co-PI will initiate a meeting of an international science outreach scheme, aimed at presenting cutting-edge research outside of the classroom environment, to the general public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>impacts of the proposed activities

Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in techniques and procedures involved in high pressure research, electron beam microscopy, and mass spectrometry. The practical training on these instruments will result in a broad skill set, highly applicable to many areas in the geosciences. The students will also have the opportunity to attend and network at national and international scientific conferences. The overall benefit is that the students supported by this work will obtain the expertise needed to pursue careers in the geosciences.

Public outreach
As part of the broader impacts of this grant, we will host high school science teachers from the surrounding area to introduce them to the technology and the science we undertake in the Early Earth and Experimental Geochemistry Laboratory at Rochester. This work will be undertaken in collaboration with Michael Occhino, Director of Science and Education at the Warner School of Education (see letter of collaboration), and is part of the Math Science
Partnership Grant administered by the latter. These 2-day workshops expose science teachers to cutting edge science and technology and data that they can take back into their classrooms. This program is new, and we are still evaluating its benefits, but this has led to email exchanges with project partner Trail and the students of the hosted teachers, which, in one case has led to student assistance with a class project (for her Global Environment course).
We will continue this program for the duration of this award.
Co-PI Savage is a new lecturer at St Andrews, and will initiate a monthly meeting of the popular scientific outreach scheme 'Pint of Science'. Here, university scientists present their research in an approachable way, outside the classroom environment, to the general community. There are a number of schemes in the UK, but so far none in St Andrews, a major omission. The research proposed above, regarding the earliest history of Earth and development of the planet to
one which can support liquid water and hence life, can easily capture the imagination and is perfect for presentation at such events as 'Pint of Science'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97594</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R002134/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C6842010-EC71-44DF-B79C-64B1BA9B3BDE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mantle &amp; Core Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5537B6B2-9FD6-40FB-B300-64555528D3FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sediment/Sedimentary Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>401A9A9F-83DF-48FD-B108-C4CC7FB7572C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tectonic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
