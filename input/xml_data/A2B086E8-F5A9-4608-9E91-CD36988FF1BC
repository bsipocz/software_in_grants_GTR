http://www.sussex.ac.uk/doctoralschool/epsrc/index is used to support outstanding PhD students in the Schools of: Mathematics and Physical Sciences (Mathematics and Atomic and Molecular and Optical Physics); Life Sciences (Chemistry); Engineering and Informatics; Psychology; and Business, Management and Economics (Science and Technology Policy Research Unit); Global Studies (Physical Geography) and Media Film and Music (Sussex Humanities Lab). Our aim is to align the EPSRC allocation to the priorities of the University and also to those of research groups and Schools working within the EPSRC remit, making full use of the flexibility which this stream of funding allows.
Recent EPSRC-funded studentships have included the following projects:
 Resonances for the Dirac equation with applications to heavy-ion collisions (Mathematics) 
 Embodied programming for primary pupils: supporting the move from concrete to abstract (Informatics)
 Theoretical studies of boron compounds and boron-containing transition metal (TM) complexes (Chemistry)
 Using semantic web and argumentation engine technologies to support investigative interviewers (Psychology/Informatics)
 Non-equilibrium quantum simulators for quantum technologies (Physics)
 Towards the in-orbit demonstration of novel semiconductor radiation detectors on a CubeSat mission (Engineering)
 Computational models for flood-risk assessment via the stochastic shallow water equation (Mathematics in collaboration with Ambiental Technical Solutions Ltd). 

In October, Directors of Doctoral Studies in departments in receipt of EPSRC research funding are invited to propose PhD projects which are selected at an EPSRC panel meeting in later November or early November. The projects are then advertised on the Sussex Research Scholarship website 
http://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/money/scholarships/pgr2016 and national websites from January and promising candidates are interviewed by supervisory teams in the spring. Candidates considering postgraduate research in EPSRC areas are encouraged to apply to the University's Junior Research Associate scheme 
http://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/money/scholarships/pgr2016 in summer of their second year of undergraduate studies to gain some research experience. Supervisors may also apply to a separate annual competition for an EPSRC CASE studentship with an industrial partner.

Some EPSRC students (principally in Mathematics and Physics) are required to attend and pass a minimum number of taught courses in their subject. Apart from the subject-specific training offered by their School and their supervisor, all EPSRC students have access to Sussex's Researcher Development Programme 
http://www.sussex.ac.uk/doctoralschool/internal/researcherdev/ of workshops, training events and online modules. After initial induction sessions organised by the Schools and the Doctoral School, the student and their supervisor conduct a training needs analysis at the start the PhD and at the start of each academic year thereafter in order to identify areas for development and to target specific workshops and courses offered by the Doctoral School that focus on these areas. EPSRC students are also able to use their Research Training Support grant to fund other training courses specific to their research and to fund attendance and presentations at relevant conferences in the UK and abroad. The Doctoral School alerts EPSRC students to any other opportunities for which they are eligible to apply - student competitions, POST internships etc.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>547346</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509784/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
