Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/N017498/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Green infrastructure (GI) delivers a range of crucial environmental processes and benefits to urban populations. GI also has the potential to play a key role in 'climate proofing' cities. Despite a wealth of scientific understanding on the importance of GI, the implementation and uptake of GI in new developments in the UK is lacking. Through a dialogue and exchange of knowledge with project partners from public, private and charity organisations, this project will develop and test a route map which translates GI scientific research into a practical and applicable user interface. Central to the development of the route map is the identification of user knowledge needs and an exploration of the current perceived barriers to GI uptake. The route map will facilitate the integration of GI science into user organisations, using Manchester as an exemplar city. Crucially, this project will also develop institutional embeddedness in project partners and other key stakeholders to utilise and apply GI science knowledge within user organisations. Through the co-production of knowledge, project partners will enhance their research literacy, thus enabling them to access, assess, translate and integrate GI science in the planning, design, delivery and funding of new developments in Manchester and beyond. It is envisaged that the approach implemented in this project will be adopted by other organisations and stakeholders, and in doing so, will help multifunctional GI-based solutions to become part of business-as-usual city growth in new developments.

This project directly address some of the difficulties developers, policy makers and practitioners have in incorporating green infrastructure (GI) into current and future developments. &amp;quot;It is frustrating that despite the growing scientific evidence of the economic, social, as well as environmental benefits of GI, this knowledge has not led to a greater take-up of GI implementation&amp;quot; [Letter of Support (LoS) from Red Rose Forest]. It has cross-sector end-user support and who are formally embedded as Project Partners and who have been instrumental in developing and steering the project formation from its inception, leading to a genuine co-production of knowledge from this project. The project also benefits from access to a comprehensive network of UK beneficiaries and end-users through the project partners' networks [e.g. LoS from Manchester City Council], and will enable the results from this project to be disseminated widely across the UK. &amp;quot;BDP's view is that this is not unique to Manchester and that the built environment industry in the UK requires significant capacity building and up-skilling to enable it to properly embed GI-based solutions&amp;quot; [LoS from Building Design Partnership]. Key beneficiaries are: those concerned with urban planning policies and practice (Manchester City Council, and Manchester: A Certain Future), stakeholders involved in master-planning and design of new urban developments (Building Design Partnership) and those involved in the practical implementation of urban GI (Red Rose Forest).


How will they benefit from this research?

The project will provide end-users with an improved understanding of the barriers and complexities of user uptake of GI and the integration of science into decision making. It will immediately provide end-users with new insights that can make a significant contribution to local and regional planning processes e.g. Manchester Green and Blue Infrastructure Strategy [Manchester City Council LoS], and support a range of specific actions within these plans [Manchester: A Certain Future LoS]. The engagement strategies in this project will empower partners to develop institutional embeddedness of GI into their practises, and act as a mechanism to showcase existing and ongoing examples of good practice to a wider audience.


What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research?

Knowledge exchange will be immediate and reflective. Knowledge will be co-produced, with project partners continuing to be involved at every stage of the research project; from support already provided in defining the research objectives, to direct involvement in workshops, meetings, and stakeholder interviews, through to advocacy with dissemination of the final project outputs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98022</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Manchester City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Manchester City Council (MCC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>7698DA5D-9984-49DA-9960-89B55B51AA12</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MCC have advised and contributed to a stakeholder survey exploring GI terms and definitions and have contributed directly (through site identification and speaker provision) to 2 Seeing is Believing Events (SiB).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c69da0959004.77232327-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>MCC is the local Government organisation for Manchester.
