What happens to the physical evidence of atrocity and genocide and how does it affect our understanding of, the often beautiful, landscapes into which the bodies of victims disappear? \n\nI plan to investigate the destruction of art and architecture for ideological, religious and political reasons and the problems inherent in the representation of the body. In particular, I want to explore the issue of idolatry from as far back as the Reformation in Britain to the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddahs by the Taliban in Afghanistan and the recent demolition of buildings associated with the prophet Mohammed by the current Saudi Arabian government.\n\nI wish to examine how personal and political narratives relate to contested landscapes, in particular those burdened with conflicting signification and the way in which confession (in both the religious sense, the documentary film making tradition and the confessional mode in contemporary art practice) is adopted as a means of confronting and coming to terms with these events. I am also interested in the way historic visual material (the archive) informs and influences the way in which we understand and represent the present and how the tension between documentary and fiction can be resolved in a work of art.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>218940</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A single channel small scale monitor based work made from digitised super 16 mm film and shown in a gallery context.

Referring to the use of aerial surveillance and reconnaissance in modern warfare, the film takes the form of an aerial journey, scanning the surface of the earth to reveal landscapes bearing traces of natural and man-made activity. Filmed in the south of Jordan and made from a succession of vertical aerial shots, Shadow Sites I exposes agricultural, industrial and military sites ranging from the ancient to the contemporary such as early farm settlements, bronze age copper mines, Roman forts and modern intensive farming.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8955DFD1-3829-4271-8F78-0D0A85BB12CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film has been screened and exhibited widely both nationally and internationally, including the Sydney (2012) and Sharjah (2013) biennials, and has been acquired by Arts Council England Collection, London and the Mori Art Museum collection, Tokyo.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-367169306.02413535a70cde6c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Shadow Sites I</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Six stills from the film Shadow Sites II produced as a series of archival pigment prints.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1A5A546D-1914-4300-B210-59D2820585FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The series Aerial I-VI has been exhibited widely both nationally and internationally including group exhibitions She Who Tells a Story, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2013); Memory Material: Jananne Al-Ani &amp;amp; St&amp;eacute;phanie Saad&amp;eacute;, Akinci Gallery, Amsterdam (2014); My Sister Who Travels, Mosaic Rooms, London and the solo exhibition Excavations at the Hayward Gallery Project Space, London (2014).

The Guide is a large scale projection made from digitised Super 16mm film and Flock is a small scale monitor based work shot of digital video.

Part of a larger portfolio of photographic and moving image work produced during the research project The Aesthetics of Disappearance: A Land Without People, The Guide and Flock explores the role of both the physical body and the 'virtual' body (through its representation in art and architecture) in the real and imagined landscapes of the Middle East.

As a desolate desert track comes into focus on a large screen, an unidentified man walks away from the camera, eventually fading into the distance. In contrast, a postcard-sized monitor shows a herd of sheep grazing on the edge of a busy highway. The calm image is interrupted repeatedly by heavy traffic passing closely in the foreground. The work draws us into the nineteenth-century Orientalist stereotype of the desert as an unoccupied site while playing on the biblical figure of the lonely shepherd and his flock.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0EAD5E7-F130-4443-A8E6-329D608AB1D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>First shown in the 2008 Whitstable Biennale, The Guide and Flock have been included in solo exhibitions at Darat al Funun, Amman, Jordan (2010); the Arthur M.

The film is an outcome of the research project The Aesthetics of Disappearance: A Land Without People, which which explores the disappearance of the body in times of war and examines the relationship between film, photography and 20th century military conflict.
Made from high-resolution aerial photographs shot in Jordan, Shadow Sites II adopts the vantage point of a Predator drone and replicates the action of 'locking onto a target'. By sequencing the images, the rich and varied traces imprinted on this landscape by ancient farming, mining, archaeological and military activity, can be deciphered. The audio track combines ambient sounds collected on location with appropriated and digitally manipulated contemporary military recordings.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5D8E0F44-2A51-49AD-9F81-95A2D72F1989</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Shadow Sites II has been exhibited and screened widely included the biennials of Venice (2011); Sydney (2012); Sharjah (2013); and Istanbul (2013).

I addressed the questions raised in my programme of research through field trips, time spent in film, photography and sound archives and by exploring the work of other artists through exhibitions, screening, lectures and face-to-face discussion.

My work has contributed to the growing intellectual debate on contemporary art practices from the Middle East through the organisation of talks and seminars and the presentation of key papers at significant conferences and events in the UK, the US and the Middle East. 

As the fellowship drew to a close I had a full programme of solo and exhibitions in place, showing to new and growing audiences, in some of the most significant venues in the Middle East. These exhibitions were followed by a series of Solo and groups shows in a number of high profile galleries in Europe, the United States and beyond.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>30427E3E-9F23-477E-B29B-BBF36DAA8C56</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447a4d9cd9e69.91855142</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The questions I addressed during my AHRC funded fellowship addressed how personal and political narratives relate to contested landscapes, in particular those burdened with conflicting signification and the way in which confession (in both the religious sense, the documentary film making tradition and the confessional mode in contemporary art practice) is adopted as a means of confronting and coming to terms with these events. 

I also examined the way historic visual material (the archive) informs and influences the way in which we understand and represent the present and how the tension between documentary and fiction can be resolved in a work of art.

During the fellowship I produced a new and ambitious body of photographic and moving image work while documenting a rich variety of sites were identified through a research process based on the examination of material in photographic, film and sound archives; by carrying out field trips and by investigating a range of subjective accounts of atrocity and genocide.
