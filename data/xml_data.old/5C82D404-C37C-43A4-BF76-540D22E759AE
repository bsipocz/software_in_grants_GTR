Although a growing number of laws have been passed to protect women, governments from around the world have struggled to convert promises into prevention.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This timely study concentrates on the 2005 'Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence and the Protection of the Victims' in Cambodia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research examines why investments are faltering, and how these insights could shape the strategies adopted by programme and policy-makers. Conducted in two provinces, the research uses a quantitative survey of rural and urban households to establish levels of understanding of the 2005 Law and see what associations can be made to different individual, community and societal factors. It also involves filmmaking with local communities and harnesses interviews with key individuals to uncover the range of knowledges and experiences surrounding DV (law).&lt;/p>

Ten years on, the workshop organised by Dr Brickell revisited the theme of wounds and wounding with a specific focus on violence against women and girls (VAWG) - a human rights abuse often described as one of the starkest collective failures of the international community in the 21st century. While in geography the wounded body has been examined in relation to the geopolitics of conflict, asylum and garment-work (as notable but not exhaustive examples), the workshop extended and deepened scholarship on precarious corporealities and lived experiences of VAWG. It also counterbalanced the onus in geography on war-related violence to generate greater awareness of the everyday spaces of VAWG within, but also critically beyond, (inter-) national landscapes of conflict and militarism. Bringing together geographers and inter-disciplinary speakers, the workshop explored the characteristics and dynamics of the entangled spaces and scales that render women's and girls' bodies the place of physical and psychological harm. It also considered the 'treatment' and healing of wounds through different means, through a range of spaces and temporalities, and with varying outcomes.

Keynotes were given by foremost Professors Chris Philo (University of Glasgow) and Rachel Pain (University of Durham). The workshop facilitated high-level conversation between audiences from geography, international relations, sociology, development studies and gender studies. Delegates from UK-based charities also participated, including Oxfam GB, Against Violence and Abuse (AVA), Trafford Rape Crisis, and WISE development.

The 'Client Consultation Workshop and Competition' held in 2014 sought to raise awareness and practice-based expertise on this important yet understudied law among 100+ undergraduate students at Pannasastra University of Cambodia. The paper analyses pre and post project evaluation data (namely questionnaires and focus groups) on the impact of the training and competition on students' knowledge and understanding of domestic violence (law) and draws on the distinction between practical and strategic gender interests to examine the challenges of the short-term educational intervention to effect deep seated change.

The seventy students were given a two-day training workshop about domestic violence with a particular emphasis on understanding Cambodia's 2005 'Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Protection of Victims'. The training, provided in part by Katherine Brickell based on her ESRC/DFID research findings, improved understanding on this previously un-taught law and intended to complement a compulsory 'Gender Studies' module that they had already all completed as part of their undergraduate studies. Training was also provided by representatives from the Ministry of Women's Affairs. After a month of study and technique preparation with assigned mentors, sixteen participants took part in a two-day 'client consultation competition'. The competition simulates a law office consultation in which the students work in pairs to respond to a client's problem. In front of a large student audience (100+) in an auditorium, each of the eight teams were allowed 45 minutes to conduct their client consultation and then hold a post-consultation discussion with each other to summarize the interview and the scope of legal work to be undertaken. Such competitions are a normal part of undergraduate Law training and aim to help students develop skills in questioning and listening to clients and applying the law to real situations. For this project, the actors playing the clients used case studies of real domestic violence incidents from the ESRC/DFID research and the competition was judged by Cambodian experts on domestic violence. High-level participation is evidenced by speeches at the final competition by the Ministry of Women's Affairs, its Secretary of State, and the UK Deputy Ambassador to Cambodia.

The aim of the research was to examine whether the training the students received impacted on the way they responded to the clients experiencing domestic violence. The client consultation interviews and post-consultation discussions were a key source of data and these were recorded, transcribed and translated. To complement this, and aid in understanding changes, the workshop students completed pre and post questionnaires. Two focus groups were also organised after the competition finale. The post-training questionnaires and focus groups showed marked changes in knowledge and beliefs in some areas. Most prominent, were changes to their understandings of what constituted domestic violence. They also had stronger understandings of domestic violence law and some of the practical, though not ideological, constraints on women being able to use domestic violence law to make claims. This impact is evidenced in the Gender and Education article reported under 'Publications'.

I organised the day to mark the end of the ESRC/DFID project. The feedback from the day was extremely positive, for example:

'I felt that the workshop was valuable for my studies as the day provided insights in ongoing research by engaging different approaches as well as specific case studies and offered ample time to network with the presenters and other workshop participants. It is particular beneficial that the workshop organiser encouraged the exchange with a variety of practitioners who offered valuable contributions to the discussions and insights into their work. In addition to reflecting on emerging research questions, this format allowed sharing practical concerns and experiences, as for example recommendations on how to deal with witnessing violence during the research process. These gained insights will have a positive lasting impact on my work and help me reflect on my own topic. Overall, the provided opportunity to exchange research ideas about this rather difficult topic was motivational and encouraging' - attending PGR student.

Engagement with the keynote speaker, Professor Chris Philo has also resulted to my invited presentation at an ESRC seminar on violence at the University of Glasgow in August 2016.

Although a growing number of laws have been passed to protect women, governments from around the world have struggled to convert promises into prevention. The ESRC-DFID funded research in Cambodia has improved understanding of why investments in law are faltering. The findings were communicated to programme and policy-makers in Cambodia during an external engagement drive in early 2014 and since this time have become even more visible in citations by government, multilateral finance institutions and NGOs (the Cambodian Ministry of Women's Affairs, 2014; Asian Development Bank, 2015; and Save the Children, 2015 as respective examples). The infographic grant report has attracted, to date, 1,000 page views (January 2016). The study has underlined to diverse audiences through a range of knowledge transfer activities, the structural challenges that need to be overcome to enable women's rights claiming. The innovative and multi-sector approach adopted by the grant team has been impactful in the following respects:

(1) THIRD SECTOR RESEARCH DATA USE: Demonstrating the in-demand status of the research, the Asia Foundation, with support from Australian Aid, formally contracted the project's quantitative dataset to use in their analysis of risk and protective factors in DV prevention (2014). 

(2) Enhancing the effectiveness of public services and policy in Cambodia: (a) GOVERNMENT: The successful public dissemination of the infographic findings report resulted in Dr Brickell's (PI) invited advisory role to the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MOWA) at closed-door strategic meetings focused on legislative review (2014). Dr Brickell was also invited to peer-review national level policy documents (2013-2014) including the 2nd National Action Plan on the Prevention of Violence Against Women 2014-2018) and Cambodia Gender Assessment 2014-2018. Results from the study on women's help seeking behaviour were cited in the Cambodia Gender Assessment 2014-2018 (2014) - the government's flagship report published every 10-years on the status of women in the country. The data informed their proposition that further policy attention is needed on this matter given that 'options for redress and support are limited for violence against women and girls'. (b) INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES: The grant team were invited to present high-level briefings to key international development agencies including the United Nations (UN) in both 2013 and 2014. The 2014 briefing attracted a wide range of UN departments to attend, namely: UNWomen; World Health Organization (WHO); UNAIDS; International Labour Organization (ILO), UN Population Fund (UNFRA); UN High Commissioner for Refugees (ONHCR); and UN Development Programme (UNDP). The success of the grant and its external engagement is evidenced in a formal letter from the Director of UNWomen in Cambodia (2014) which states that 'The report which you have disseminated enables us to design development programme interventions on the basis of credible evidence and recommendations. It effectively highlights to UN Women that the challenges of domestic violence reduction are wide-ranging and a plurality of gaps require systematic policy attention.' In 2016 UNWOMEN commissioned a background paper on domestic violence law for its flagship global report Progress of the World's Women 2018. This has been written by Dr Brickell and is now accepted.

(3) CONTRIBUTION TO UK SELECT COMMITTEES: In the UK, Dr Brickell has engaged government through written submissions based on the research findings in Cambodia to the UK Foreign Affairs Committee Inquiry on Human Rights (2016) and UK Parliamentary Select Committee on Violence against Women and Girls (2013).

(4) INVITED ADVICE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (DFID): The significance accorded to the study by policymakers is evidenced by the request for a 1-page findings summary which was published in the 2016 guidance note 'Shifting Social Norms to Tackle Violence Against Women and Girls'. The guidance note is intended to support DFID advisors and programme managers with evidence, relevant examples and practical guidance on how to address harmful social norms in the context of programming to prevent VAWG.&amp;nbsp;While laws against VAWG are an important policy commitment and are seen to create an enabling environment for change, the grant case study material included in the report demonstrates how legislation can actually entrench gender norms and traditions rather than challenge them. A link to the research report was also included the DFID Violence Against Women and Girls Evidence Digest (Issue 2, 2014) circulated to DFID staff and cross-government experts. On the basis of her grant leadership, Dr Brickell was invited to act as advisory board member (2012-2016) on a DFID-funded Country Assignment on domestic violence in Ghana which is being led by the world-renowned Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex.

(5) ENGAGING UK CHARITIES: At the end of the grant a 1-day workshop was organised at the Wellcome Collection, London on 'The Geographies that Wound' (2015). It stimulated discussion and connections between academics and UK-based charities working on violence against women and girls. Delegates from UK-based charities also participated including Oxfam GB, Against Violence &amp;amp; Abuse (AVA), Trafford Rape Crisis and WISE Development. 

(6) MEDIA EXPOSURE: The grant has attracted repeated print and online media attention, including in The Guardian (2013 and 2015), Cambodia Daily (2014 and 2015), Phnom Penh Post (2014 and 2016); and Huffington Post (2014). The findings were even showcased as front-page national news in the Phnom Penh Post (2014) - Cambodia's oldest English language newspaper. They have also been the feature of radio broadcasts on the stations Radio Free Asia and Radio France International (2014). 

(7) SPIN-OFF RESEARCH FUNDING AND IMPACT: Forming a new collaboration with Pannasastra University in Cambodia, Dr Brickell was awarded a grant from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Bilateral Programme Fund to hold a client consultation workshop and competition on Cambodia's DV law (2014). This spin-off grant maximised the impact of the original ESRC-DFID grant. Findings from the ESRC-DFID study formed the basis of training that Dr Brickell delivered to students from Pannasastra University of Cambodia. The cases used in the training and client consultation competition were also based on those of domestic violence victims interviewed as part of the ESRC-DFID study. The educational intervention was a capacity builder among Cambodia's next generation of lawmakers. Analysis of evaluation data in 2015 (pre and post questionnaires + focus groups) evidences important changes to their understandings of what constituted domestic violence. Prior to the training intervention, domestic violence was primarily considered to constitute physical abuse. But after the training, many of them were able to explain the myriad types of violence in considerable depth. Participants also had stronger understandings of domestic violence law and some of the practical constraints on women being able to use domestic violence law to access justice. The project attracted interest from a range of broadcast and print media. It thereby showcased UK research excellence and facilitated new educational ties between the UK and Cambodia. The project also raised the profile of the British Embassy and its prioritisation of 'democratic values and the rule of law' in a country with a particularly poor human rights record. The Ministry of Women's Affairs provided training to the students and its Secretary of State, H.E. Sy Define, acted as keynote speaker at the final award ceremony. Deputy Head of Mission from the British Embassy, Dr Bryony Mathew, also attended the competition and delivered a speech. In it she detailed how 'The British Embassy is committed to supporting skills training for young Cambodian peopleAnd one of our key priorities is legal and judicial reform and the rule of law. The Embassy's sponsorship of the Domestic Violence Law course and final contest has therefore been an especially rewarding example of cooperation with Cambodian institutions'. Women's rights are a key issue for the FCO into 2016 and are likely to continue as so in the post-2015 development framework. They are also relevant to Violence Against Women and Girls' (VAWG) advisers and programme managers in DFID. Education, with its ability to challenge and change norms is widely considered a key means through which VAWG can be prevented. Project outcomes of this grant are therefore of significance across Her Majesty's Government. 

(8) SPIN-OFF DOCTORAL FUNDING TO ADDRESS POLICY LACUNA - While VAWG has been established as a widespread and systemically entrenched phenomenon in Cambodian society, the ESRC-DFID research exposed that the state of knowledge on response systems and victim services remains very weak by comparison. With a named student, Dr Brickell successfully applied (2014) for a +3 ESRC CASE doctoral award in collaboration with the NGO CAFOD. It intends to address this policy lacuna and is entitled 'Sheltering from Violence: Women's Experiences of Safe Houses in Cambodia'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A00166CF-15FD-43F8-9231-E4214C6962F2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>566eb273b7ec71.58293720</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1.Original knowledge generated through multi-stakeholder research with domestic violence (DV) victims, legal and health professionals, police officers, policy makers, and other authority leaders. The study's findings demonstrate how political economy dynamics are crucial to understanding the path and outcomes of DV law. Outputs including a widely cited infographics report, eight published or in press journal articles, a forthcoming monograph, and landmark handbook chapter, highlight how fundamental changes in social, economic and political realms of Cambodian life are required if DV victims are to become 'active citizens' who can claim legally sanctioned rights. While the quantitative survey indicates that 92% of participants (n=1,177) were aware of the law's existence, the findings overall show that the socio-legal conditions for DV law to be exercised in practice are hindered by four main factors.

 
(A) Structural gender inequities - The make-up of the economy and structural gender inequalities within it sees the material basis for women's ability to negotiate their life-decisions diminished by an economic dependency on spouses that was pervasive within the case study communities. There are strong economic reasons for remaining in an abusive relationship and foregoing rights, especially in rural sites. 


(B) Social norms -The efficacy of DV law to assist victims was limited by prevailing gender norms around women's silence and responsibility for harmony in the family (commonly to the detriment of women's wellbeing). Primary research data combined with secondary analysis of the law itself showcases how legislation can actually entrench gender norms and traditions rather than challenge them.&amp;nbsp;


(C) Impunity for perpetrators - A major hindrance to the up take of DV law is the weak rule of law environment and public distrust of the justice system. The research found consistent evidence of DV law use being actively discouraged by local stakeholders because of the 'dangers' of corruption that victims may face, including the extortion of informal fees. 


(D) Inadequacy of financial and human resources - Local institutional stakeholders interviewed repeatedly highlight the risks of pursuing DV law given that the budget and facilities are rarely in place to safely support its implementation and enforcement.


Now over a decade since the law's ratification, these factors have resulted in a continued reliance on customary local reconciliation, a process that often re-traumatises DV victims and compromises their agency. DV law too often remains a nominal threat rather than actionable mechanism in both rural and urban Cambodia.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research makes a major intervention in feminist, development and political geography and has successfully advocated for the belated study of violence against women and girls (VAWG) in the discipline. The findings are to be taken forward by the PI to initiate a feminist turn in the burgeoning legal geographies field. They can also be put to use by interdisciplinary audiences in women's studies, international relations, development studies, sociology and law. Beyond academia, the need for a multi-sector approach to DV prevention and alleviation evidenced through the research data is of significance to policy communities in Cambodia (Ministry of Women's Affairs, UNWomen), the United Kingdom (Department for International Development, Foreign and Commonwealth Office) and among regional and international NGOs. For those designing programmes to tackle VAWG, it is important to recognise the interlocking factors that prevent change from happening and to design interventions and strategies that address the most relevant factors in any given context.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AD165F52-E603-4157-A6FF-315CE4C6616E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>566eb254073c88.08386574</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited peer reviewer, violence against women chapter of Cambodia Gender Assessment 2014-2018, Cambodian Ministry of Women's Affairs.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4978E4FB-191A-4B43-87A1-33C0E77CE273</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>566ef268641d68.66105608</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Health Squared - citation of ESRC/DFID report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB44EA66-4839-404D-BCC6-B83125FCB7BD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56716353b6bd92.21430657</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.academia.edu/8188817/An_Audit_and_Assessment_Of_Prevention_Based_Messages_Within_The_Cambodian_Press</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Governance and Social Development Resource Centre - citation of ESRC/DFID report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ADEA8C96-E83B-433E-88A8-5458B404E75F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56715fd36be452.96947331</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.gsdrc.org/publications/social-protection-programmes-supporting-women-survivors-of-domestic-violence/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Opposition leader blog comment</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2EA710F6-39F4-4F93-A383-568C5BDA2511</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Posted reply to www.katherinebrickell.com to ESRC/DFID research blog by Cambodia's foremost female (opposition) leader MP Mu Sochua - 'As one of the initiators of the law, I am very interested in knowing its implementation.
