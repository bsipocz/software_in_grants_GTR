We will use a simple immediate memory probe task: on each trial a list of between one and four stimuli (eg faces) is shown to a participant, followed by a short pause and a test (probe) stimulus. The participant makes a rapid &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; decision as to whether the probe was one of the list items. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our previous work has shown that if the item was not in the list, but has been seen recently (eg on the last two trials), then the 'no' response is slower and more errors are made than if the probe item has not been seen for a number of trials: this difference provides us with an index of apparent recency. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will control the stimuli encountered by our participants between &amp;quot;study&amp;quot; (when they last saw stimulus X) and &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; (when X is presented as a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; probe on the current trial). &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our model predicts that interpolated items will influence the estimated recency of the probe depending on the similarity relationship between them, familiarity of the stimulus set, and the associative linkages created by earlier encounters with other items. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79949</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk given the School of Psychology at the University of Nottingham.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F171202C-30F1-4111-AD19-209571E080D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Questions and discussion.

1. We have established that, if a stimulus has recently been encountered, the associative activation of that stimulus' representation reduces the perceived recency of that stimulus on subsequent presentation. In other words, if a stimulus such as a chequerboard or face was recently encountered, and then that stimulus representation was associatively retrieved, the effect is for that stimulus to seem less recent when next encountered than would otherwise have been the case. The effect of associative activation of a stimulus representation is thus the opposite to what occurs when a stimulus representation is directly activated by perception of that stimulus. This is a novel, remarkable, important result, it is a result that we predicted based on the model of associative memory that informed our proposal, and it strongly constrains the way that we view memory for recency. 

2. We have also established that retroactive interference effects on memory for recency of occurrence have a non-monotonic relationship with similarity. This is another result predicted by our model and may lead to a better understanding of interference effects in memory. The result is that whilst encountering quite different stimuli (e.g. letter strings) to the to-be-remembered stimulus (e.g. a face) typically makes relatively little difference to memory for that face, encountering another face makes memory worse, but encountering a very similar yet distinct face has a less negative impact roughly equivalent to that of encountering an unrelated stimulus.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We intend to follow up this research and establish whether similar effects to those found with positive probes can, as we expect, be found with negative probes. Further development of the model that generated the predictions tested in this proposal is also planned. One question that our work now poses for the the wider psychological community is this: Is it always the case that the effect of associatively activating a stimulus representation is the opposite to that obtained by its direct perception? This is now the active focus of research at a number of the Universities in the UK and represents ongoing impact for this project. 
Another consequence of this project is that it entails a reappraisal of our understanding of the mechanisms governing interference in memory. The wider question here is to what extent the non-monotonic function that we have found for memory for recency of occurrence is also the case in other memory domains. We expect this to be an ongoing question that continues to have impact over the next several years.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8712D933-C703-413B-A0A0-8F9614EC875F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460a18f906a61.33387627</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AEC4C05F-78A4-44C0-AF01-3A0910386F8D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Does associative activation have the same or different effect on learning and memory to perceptual activation?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/19fd5254ee19dd37aff533768dc12b8d"><gtr:id>19fd5254ee19dd37aff533768dc12b8d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ian P.L.
