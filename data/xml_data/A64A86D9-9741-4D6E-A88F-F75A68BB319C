end-use</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K007254/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This fellowship proposal is for the calculation of future scenarios of technological change and CO2 emissions in energy end-use, through the development of an interacting multi-sectoral family of theoretical and computational models of technology diffusion in energy end-use systems. The integration of this family of models into the Energy-Economy-Environment (E3) Model at the Global level (E3MG) will create the first global E3 model to consider simultaneously technology diffusion patterns, induced technological change in all sectors of energy use (transport, industry, end-use), natural resource constraints and the interaction between sectors.

The reduction of CO2 emissions requires changes of energy consuming technologies, such as vehicles for transport, lighting, heating and cooling systems, as well as industrial systems such as steel furnaces and aluminium smelters. Historically changes of technology occur gradually, following advances in engineering and production supply chains, but also through evolutions of habits and behaviours. Such historical diffusion patterns have been studied extensively using S-shaped curves [1], and it has been recognised that their inclusion in energy modelling is required in order to improve scenarios of future energy use, but they are challenging to implement and remain absent in current models [2]. Technology substitutions include for instance the replacement of petrol cars by electric vehicles or gas boilers by heat pumps, but also the replacement of one set of habits by another, such as switching from personal car use to public transport.

Individual emissions reduction measures have, when put in a multi-sectoral context, mutual synergies or they can be detrimental to one another, in terms of efficiency of energy use. The coordination of such measures is a complex problem that requires careful planning, and should ideally be based on analysing simultaneously the whole system of E3 interactions. For example, the calculation of global greenhouse gas emissions resulting from policies and economic scenarios involves a simultaneous study of emissions from all energy consumption and transformation sectors: power generation, industry, transport and end-use, driven by the demand for services or goods in these sectors. 

The research proposed for this fellowship concerns firstly the development and integration of a complete family of new sub-models of technological change in energy end-use sectors into the existing Energy-Economy-Environment Model at the Global level (E3MG). E3MG is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the global economy, featuring 20 world regions and 42 industrial sectors. This work will use a new theoretical framework that was recently developed by myself for forecasting technological diffusion and learning-by-doing in competitive markets, which was successfully applied to construct a new sub-model for E3MG of the global power sector. The core of this project will involve using the combination of all models to generate UK and global future scenarios of technology and CO2 emissions, using external assumptions such as regulations, world population and land use. This will additionally enable fellow group members to explore macroeconomic impacts such as &amp;quot;green growth&amp;quot;.

The work proposed will benefit from two-way interactions with a group of stakeholders at all stages of the project development. This will involve three main groups: applied economists at Cambridge Econometrics, environmental scientists of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East-Anglia and policy advisors and researchers at the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change and the UK Energy Research Centre. These groups will contribute by providing insight in bridging technology to the economy, contribute guidance on climate policy in the context of the UK's decarbonisation strategy and enable to explore environmental and human impacts associated with future CO2 emission.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The key impacts likely to result from this project concern UK and global evidence-based policy-making, providing a valuable contribution to the global knowledge pool upon which to ground decisions and improve the sustainability of global technology systems and economic development. Policy decisions however require public support, and thus an impact onto public understanding of the findings of this project is also sought.

The UK public sector will benefit directly from this research in its efforts to evaluate efficient greenhouse gas reduction pathways for its 2050 target, and in informing measures of reductions of energy consumption. Effectively, this will create the unique opportunity to study multi-sectoral interactions in energy consumption including technology diffusion and learning-by-doing concepts in all sectors of energy use, and changes in the efficiency of energy use generated by policy. This project will therefore provide a valuable contribution to the knowledge basis underlying CO2 emissions reduction measures in the UK, and could inform the 2050 pathways calculator of the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in parallel to other models. Additionally, in collaboration with economists at 4CMR and Cambridge Econometrics, this project will enable to generate important insights on employment and economic growth impacts of investments in green technology for the UK, so-called 'green growth', in an international context, a contribution that is likely to be unique. Co-benefits of this research will emerge through additional insights for UK energy security associated with decarbonisation strategies. 

Internationally, the impacts on policy, likely to originate from this research will occur through improving the information supplied to climate change policy-makers. Three areas could benefit from this research. Firstly, it can contribute to improving the current work on the creation of efficient global pathways to CO2 emissions reductions for instance in developing countries and emerging economies, or evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of existing policy decisions. Secondly, it can help determine strategies for reaching national energy security goals, in particular with respect to the transport sector and oil and gas supplies. Thirdly, in collaboration with other members of the Cambridge research group and with researchers in partner institutions such as the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, it can contribute significantly to the demonstration the global economic benefits of certain CO2 emissions reduction pathways through green growth as well as the avoidance of climate impacts. 

Contacts have been established with key science advisors at the UK Committee on Climate Change and the Department for Energy and Climate Change. Additional interactions will be sought with key policy-makers at various governmental institutions such as the Department for Transport (DfT), as well as with representatives of the industry. The particular actors targeted will vary during the length of this project as the focus evolves. In addition to the groups named above, collaborations are sought with other energy research groups nationally and internationally who could advise and benefit from the development of methodology and theory in this project, such as the UCL Energy Institute (MARKAL model) and the Grantham Institute for Climate Change. Contacts have been established with researchers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (MESSAGE model) and the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (IMAGE model). 

Direct public engagement and outreach activities will also be undertaken, detailed in the section Pathways to Impact. An emphasis will be given to communicating clearly the difficulties encountered in the coordination of emissions reduction measures, an aspect which has been poorly covered due to the lack of public or media understanding of these particular issues.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>231480</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cambridge Econometrics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>BRIDGE team, Newton Fund project</gtr:description><gtr:id>94402196-3566-430B-98A2-DA83F0F93CA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project started with a Kick-off meeting at the end of April 2016.

Cambridge University contributes expertise in international law, governance and policy, and methods for strategic policy-making.
The combination of these components enables to evaluate impacts assessments from the policies to their environmental impacts with the evolution of the global economy.

Since this grant was a personal fellowship, its impact would not have been extensive if carried out by myself alone; it is thus clear that the use of FTT tools by others outside of my team was the pathway to successful impact. 

SMEs play an important role in the European policy sphere and beyond, providing fast and accessible analytical capacity for Impact Assessment to guide policy-making an important contributor to the European knowledge-based industry. In this respect, the consultancy company Cambridge Econometrics Ltd (CE) has proved a natural partner for the impact of this award: they have provided extensive networks for applying the results of this project for policy analysis by institutions and governments. CE has facilitated the application of results of this project for policy analysis in a wide range of applications by different stakeholders, including the European Commission, OPEC, IRENA, researchers and governments in East-Asia and various Horizon 2020 bids and projects. Thus as a result of this project, CE, with its large team of policy analysts, now uses in its standard energy-economy analyses the FTT framework for energy policy analysis, in particular, in many projects in which I am not involved. Meanwhile, this project interacted with its other partner, the Committee on Climate Change, at various points in time.

The FTT framework has been described very transparently in several journal publications (Mercure et al. 2014, 2016, Mercure 2015, Mercure &amp;amp; Lam 2015), the key contributions having been made Open Access. Thus any other policy analyst outside of our cross-institutional team can use or reproduce the FTT model. This has opened many possibilities and interest from governments and institutions internationally for commissioned analyses. 

The FTT model unexpectedly became a very successful educational tool for teaching university students on energy modelling and environmental policy. Its accessible version with a graphical user interface is now being used at both Cambridge University and Radboud University, in class and as a policy analysis tool in post-graduate dissertations. It is open-source and widely accessible online.

This project has attracted interest for application in large collaborations: I have been significantly involved in several Horizon 2020 bids. In this context, I organised a workshop in order to bring together academics, policy and consultancy, at Hughes Hall, University of Cambridge. This led to submitting a ?5M Horizon 2020 bid, which I co-led, involving 21 research institutions across the globe. 

This large network has opened many opportunities, and ultimately led to the success of an ESRC bid, a multidisciplinary cross-institutional &amp;pound;800k project of which I am now PI (no ES/N013174/1). This involves engaging policy circles in Brazil on issues of the energy-water-food nexus. I am thus becoming a leader in coordinating multi-disciplinary research across borders, multiplying the impact of this fellowship. Immediately after the end of this fellowship, I accepted a post of Assistant Professor in Energy, Climate and Innovation at Radboud University in the Netherlands. 

By 2017, this work has led to opening new research areas and knowledge for and used by policy-makers, in (1) policy-induced energy innovation, as part of a ?1M consultancy project with the European Commission (DG ENER) and (2) the global and regional impacts of stranded fossil fuel assets, work now under review in Nature.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>28B44673-5C7B-4533-BDCE-C42F3A285E12</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544a221fa1e726.67055902</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>FTT:Power is a simulation of the future technology composition, fuel use, investment and greenhouse gas emissions by the global electricity sector in 53/21 regions (E3ME/E3MG).</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>EP/K007254/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>6C738982-A96E-4DA5-9B1E-464A98140239</gtr:id><gtr:impact>FTT:Power is a modelling framework and FORTRAN code that was built into the E3MG and E3ME software of Cambridge Econometrics Ltd by myself, freely supplied to them for their commercial use.

Cambridge Econometrics now supplies FTT:Power as part of its commercial license of E3ME. It has been used for at least two commercial projects already. The first is for energy policy analysis of EU renewables targets by a consortium led by a German University (Leipzig). The second is for electricity policy analysis in East Asian countries (Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan), with emphasis on the nuclear situation, by a large Japanese research consortium, of which the output will be in the form of a book.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Yes</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>5447c0fc01b336.71292988</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:protection>Copyrighted (e.g. software)</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Future Technology Transformations for the Power sector (FTT:Power) modelling framework</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2013</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Under this EPSRC fellowship I have significantly developed the Future Technology Transformations (FTT) theoretical and computational modelling framework, which is designed for simulating the policy-induced future diffusion of new technologies in existing energy technology markets, for assessing the impact of climate change mitigation policies. The goal is to produce a set of quantitative tools that can be used to inform environmental policy-making. This work is on-going and will continue beyond the end of this grant. 

FTT:Power was further developed into a widely used electricity model, and been integrated to the workflow of the consultancy company Cambridge Econometrics Ltd. It is used commercially for policy analysis to advise governments around the world on energy-economy-environment policy. Many consultancy projects have now been carried out with FTT, including for the European Commission, OPEC, IRENA, and energy policy research groups in East-Asia. The model is now supplied as part of the commercial licensing of the economic model E3ME, but also open source/open access through the website of the University of Cambridge. This multiplies the policy impact of the FTT modelling framework many times over what I could initially achieve on my own (see Mercure et al. 2014, 2016). 

For the development of FTT:Transport, a large database on vehicle sales in over 20 countries of the world including the UK was built. It shows different structures of vehicle markets across the world, and enabled us to devise a method to assess the effectiveness of emissions reduction policy in transport (Mercure &amp;amp; Lam 2015). FTT:Transport has proved more difficult to develop than planned: a need emerged for further research using methods of sociology on the drivers of choice for vehicle types and sizes, which is underway with a pilot side-project funded under the EPSRC ReCoVER project.

We have used this dataset to parameterise the decision-making structure of the new FTT:Transport model of technology diffusion in the transport sector. This model is completed and currently under a testing stage, and being integrated into the main workflow of Cambridge Econometrics Ltd. We saw its first use in existing funded projects (DG ENER, Horizon 2020) at the beginning of 2016, in which FTT is featured as a key model enabling to win those bids. 

The theoretical structure underpinning the FTT model has been significantly detailed both in a mathematical publication (Mercure 2015), and in an accessible form (Mercure et al. 2016). Further work in this direction is to be submitted for publication shortly. 

The E3ME-FTT integrated model was linked to emulators of the climate system in order to be able to follow the impacts of energy policy choices all the way to the detailed environmental impacts (Mercure et al. 2014). This now makes E3ME-FTT a new Integrated Assessment Model able to explore different questions. We have suggested a new approach for integrated science-policy interface for improving policy-making for sustainable development (Mercure et al. 2016). This method has brought me to bid for funds for expanding this method, which has been successful with the ESRC (Project no ES/N013174/1).

In 2017, we made an important discovery using this whole suite of models: financial assets in the form of fossil fuels are highly likely to become stranded, due to the ongoing trajectory of electrification of private road transportation, and renewables development, significantly decreasing the demand for fossil fuels. Stranded assets can take the form of physical capital (pipelines, tankers, drilling equipment) or financial (e.g. the value of oil reserves), currently valued in the trillions of dollars. Such a loss is inevitable and comparable to the subprime mortgage loss in 2007; however it can be managed in order not to lead to an economic recession; we show that all major nations (e.g. USA) are nevertheless better off (in terms of GDP and employment) to stick to the current climate agreements rather than pulling out. This unexpected results is the real outcome of this project &amp;quot;Multi-Sectoral Interactions in Energy End-Use&amp;quot; as expected at the time of applying for the grant. This is currently (March 2017) under review in Nature (i.e. deemed of sufficient interest by editors and sent to reviewers). If it does not get published in Nature, we will send it to another high impact journal.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our output model for passenger transport modelling is integrated to the E3ME model of Cambridge Econometrics Ltd. E3ME is a well known policy analysis model used by various research groups and policy analysts around the world, as well as consultancy projects for the European Commission and other governments or institutions around the world (e.g. recently: the European Commission, OPEC, IRENA, the Brazilian government, and more). The FTT modelling system is now, due to this fellowship, entirely part of this mainstream and widely used policy analysis tool, and enables to explore issues of energy-economy dynamics. E3ME is now called E3ME-FTT, and its FTT component is beginning to become known in policy analysis circles. That is due to a new string of papers published during this fellowship, not all written by myself. This indicates that it is seeing use beyond my own, which fulfils the goal of this project.

By 2017, this work has now opened two new research areas, (1) a new method to study policy-induced technology innovation, and (2) stranded fossil fuel assets and related socio-economic impact. We expect to obtain further research funding under both of these research areas.

The FTT model is now attracting significant numbers of policy analysis projects. During this fellowship, it has been used for energy policy analysis by researchers in a large consortium in East Asia by which a book was written (Lee, Pollitt and Park 2015), by OPEC, IRENA, the European Commission (DG ENER), Horizon 2020 projects and other consultancy projects. 

Three PhD students are currently carrying out their projects using the FTT or E3ME-FTT modelling suite. This will enable the community to grow and expand its realm of application. The structure of this project enables them to spend time in the consultancy world of Cambridge Econometrics, exposing them to the real world of policy-making and advising. This will further their careers either in academia or in the wider world. It also offers a strong bridge between Cambridge Econometrics and the academic world.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BDE1B324-CE8F-4767-9489-145F4D9CAC83</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447c40abc6604.04355917</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The FTT:Power software simulates the development of the global electricity sector in 24 technologies for 21/53/59 regions of the world (in 3 usable versions).
