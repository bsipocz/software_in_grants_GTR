It is a space where you describe your position using n coordinates, where n is a positive whole number. We are familiar with n is 1, 2 and 3: these are the straight line, the flat plane, and the usual 3-dimensional space with x, y and z-axes respectively. Not all geometry is flat: take the surface of a sphere or a doughnut, for example. However, if we stand on a sphere, and it is large like the Earth, then it looks like flat Euclidean 2-space to us, at least close by. Thus, the surface of a sphere is a manifold: a shape which looks like Euclidean n-space near each point, but is not necessarily flat. The surface of a doughnut is also a 2-dimensional manifold and the interior of the Earth is a 3-dimensional manifold. My subject is Differential Geometry, which is the study of manifolds.Imagine you have a tennis ball and you draw an equator on it. The equator is a circle which lies on the ball. Since a circle is a 1-dimensional manifold, the equator is a submanifold of the surface of the ball; that is, it is a manifold sitting inside a bigger manifold. My research is all about submanifolds.You can do a lot with manifolds by putting more geometric structure on them. For example, we can think of fluid flow and gravity as extra information about the geometry of a manifold. One piece of data is called an exceptional holonomy group which can only happen in dimensions seven and eight; this makes these dimensions particularly fascinating. Manifolds with an exceptional holonomy group are called G_2 manifolds in seven dimensions and Spin(7) manifolds in eight. My proposed work is on special 4-dimensional submanifolds called coassociative 4-folds in G_2 manifolds and Cayley 4-folds in Spin(7) manifolds. Coassociative and Cayley 4-folds satisfy equations which mean their area is as small as possible. Therefore, they are like bubbles, which shrink in order to minimize their surface area subject to constraints, such as containing a fixed volume of air.So far we have thought about smooth objects, but suppose we look at a cone. A cone is not smooth at its tip: this is an example of a singularity, which is a 'bad' point on a manifold. Another property of a cone is that it is defined by its cross-section. If we put the tip of a cone and the centre of a sphere at the same place, then the set of points where the cone meets the surface of the sphere is called the link of the cone. The link is a cross-section of the cone and a submanifold of the surface of the sphere. To generalise, we first define the n-sphere as the set of points in Euclidean (n+1)-space which are all unit distance from the origin. Then, if we have a 4-dimensional cone in Euclidean (n+1)-space, its link is a 3-dimensional submanifold of the n-sphere.An exciting aspect of my research is its connection with an area of physics called String Theory. This theory tries to describe how the universe works by thinking of particles not as points, but loops of 'string' instead. A strange by-product of this idea is that the universe has to have many dimensions. Specifically, we have to visualise the universe as having 10, 11 or 12 dimensions, consisting of a large 4-dimensional manifold and a very small extra 6, 7 or 8-dimensional piece; this is why it relates to my work. The first problems that I want to solve are to find ways of covering G_2 or Spin(7) manifolds using coassociative or Cayley 4-folds, which may have singularities, such that every point of the manifold is covered only once. The solutions would help answer difficult questions in String Theory.Understanding singularities is an important part of geometry. The other part of my project is to discover which cone-like singularities can occur. To do this, I want to find out when a 3-dimensional manifold can be pushed into the 6-sphere or the 7-sphere so that it becomes a submanifold which is the link of a coassociative or Cayley cone.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313766</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This grant has finished recently and, as yet, the outcomes of the research have not had any economic or societal impact.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7AD8E99B-962B-477A-8310-C73EF431A165</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>54486f98792e17.33140337</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project aimed to provide a greater understanding of the exceptional geometry which occurs in 7 and 8 dimensions. Its primary goals were to understanding coverings of 7 and 8 -dimensional spaces by special (known as &amp;quot;calibrated&amp;quot;) 4-dimensional objects, and to study calibrated 4-dimensional cones related to 7 and 8-dimensional geometry.

A key achievement in the project, which was one of the two main objectives, was to give a full description of the natural calibrated 4-dimensional cones in 7 and 8 dimensions, which is detailed in two published papers by the PI.

A second major result, which is also described in a published paper by the PI, was to produce the first examples of certain calibrated 4-dimensional objects which look like calibrated cones near isolated points. Building on this result, in another published paper by the PI, it was shown that these cone points could be &amp;quot;smoothed out&amp;quot;, resulting in a smooth calibrated 4-dimensional object. Rather than simply proving these specific results, the PI developed a more general theory which is potentially applicable more widely.

The goal of producing coverings still remains out of reach due to problems with a collaborator (as discussed elsewhere). However, the outcomes of this project mean that the tools to solve the problem are now in place. Moreover, the PI is now working with their PhD student (Kim Moore) and Van der Veken (who was a postdoc supervised by the PI but now has a tenured position) on aspects of calibrated 4-dimensional objects in 8 dimensions so as to solve the covering problem in 8-dimensional spaces with exceptional geometry.

During the course of the project, the research landscape changed substantially, especially with the growth of the field, researchers from other areas becoming interested in exceptional geometry, and the PI disseminating the outcomes of the project. Consequently, the PI has developed a number of new collaborations relevant to exceptional geometry, including Kapouleas, Karigiannis, N.C. Leung, Madsen, Pacini and Van der Veken. 

Of particular relevance to this project is work of the PI and Karigiannis, which has resulted in a paper that is currently under review, in which we describe how 7-dimensional spaces which look like cones (either at isolated points or from far way) can deform. In this way we proved that the first concrete examples of smooth 7-dimensional spaces with exceptional geometry are unique, in a certain natural sense. 

Finally, the PI has undertaken training in public engagement, both financed by the grant and through UCL, and successfully used it in discussing their research with the public through talks, informal presentations, stand-up comedy and videos. The PI has also used these skills in designing and writing a policy briefing, describing research in the UCL Mathematics department in an understandable way for policy makers and civil servants. This briefing was given to the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills at an event primarily organized by the PI in which the Head of the BIS and his team visited the UCL Maths Department.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have already been taken forward by researchers studying calibrated geometry and minimal submanifolds in spheres and related problems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A5E6F378-C23F-4DE4-9D93-8528CA6F2B41</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544873da806765.68960755</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>75B2237A-0A20-480E-9EB2-4F554FA0D660</gtr:id><gtr:title>Desingularization of coassociative 4-folds with conical singularities: Obstructions and applications</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions of the American Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ca88036266860d4bd0cb792b5558ca3"><gtr:id>2ca88036266860d4bd0cb792b5558ca3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lotay J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544864ad6848c5.78814456</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>34011288-1D1D-4D34-8518-644548CD339F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stability of coassociative conical singularities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Communications in Analysis and Geometry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ca88036266860d4bd0cb792b5558ca3"><gtr:id>2ca88036266860d4bd0cb792b5558ca3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lotay J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544864acd2a801.69822007</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4524BA5C-5555-4B02-ABDA-596AEC1C7870</gtr:id><gtr:title>Associative submanifolds of the 7-sphere</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ca88036266860d4bd0cb792b5558ca3"><gtr:id>2ca88036266860d4bd0cb792b5558ca3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lotay J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544864ad114760.86663442</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CF6204A1-D6D0-4B4B-A209-E83EA12F29CB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ruled Lagrangian submanifolds of the 6-sphere</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions of the American Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ca88036266860d4bd0cb792b5558ca3"><gtr:id>2ca88036266860d4bd0cb792b5558ca3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lotay J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544864ac7b5c21.23345415</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H003584/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>AD9BC822-179D-41B6-BFA8-E12A91534221</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/H003584/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>444596.38</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>6CCE351E-B6AA-4A97-A9B4-224F20846523</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/H003584/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>313766.34</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
