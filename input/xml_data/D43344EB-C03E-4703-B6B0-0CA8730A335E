armoured vehicles has changed from heavy armour such as main battle tanks (MBT) to highly
manoeuvrable light and medium armoured vehicles (LAV?s and MAV?s) which have been
and are being used in recent conflicts such as the Balkans and Afghanistan where speed and
manoeuvrability are key to operational effectiveness.
Whilst LAV are fast and manoeuvrable, their light armour is susceptible to Improvised
Explosive Devices (IED?s) and this has led to a cycle of ?up-armouring? and design
improvements (including ?V? shaped hulls) by the LAV builders and a corresponding
increase in the size of IED?s from 10Kg to 25, 50 and sometimes even much bigger devices in
the 100 to 250kg range by the enemy. Although these improvements in design and the
increase in armour plating have minimised the penetration of LAV hulls to even large IED?s,
this has come at the penalty of weight and manoeuvrability. LAV?s and MAV?s have become
20 ? 35 ton MRAP?s (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) which are often too heavy to cross
existing bridges and often get bogged down in sand or mud. More importantly even though
large IED?s at present do not penetrate the current heavy MRAP) vehicles, the blast is such
that the vehicle is lifted at such a high rate (global acceleration) that the occupants can be
killed or severely injured simply by the acceleration effects on their bodies. A jump height
greater than 1m generally results in spinal injuries unless effective mine blast seats are fitted
to the vehicle.
The immediate focus of armed forces is to procure LAV?s and MAV?s that offer occupant
protection through design against IED?s whilst minimising the weight penalty and
maintaining manoeuvrability. ABBS has developed and proven the feasibility of two
concepts for Active Mine Protection Systems (AMPS) for armoured vehicles which have a
low additional weight. The system detects the mine blast forces and directly counteracts in
equal measure the global acceleration threat to the vehicle occupants. The technology is
novel, and is patented worldwide.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>250000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">720397</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
