A recent survey of empirical research suggests that despite a long history of interest and investigation, support for predicted relationships between mating behaviour and patterns of parental investment is poor. For example, males are predicted to decrease their parental effort in response to a decrease in their paternity if there are opportunities for higher paternity in the future, and females are expected to choose males based on male traits that indicate his fitness. However, neither of these predictions have firm empirical support. Consequently the explanatory power of the current conceptual framework relies upon post-hoc explanations rather than being able to generate a priori predictions. 

The likely reason for this is that the components of the relationship between mating and parental care that are important, such as conflict between the sexes over the amount of care to provide and parent-offspring behaviours, have been studied independently without considering their interactions (i.e. without considering social and co-evolutionary feedback loops). To be able to predict the evolution of patterns of mating behaviour and parental investment (and therefore mating systems and the life-histories of organisms) requires an understanding of how the behaviour of each family member is affected by the behaviour of the other members of the family. 

Here we propose to use artificial selection to test how female mating behaviour co-evolves with male care, trades-off with maternal care and influences parent-offspring relationships. In particular we will examine how these feedback loops affect or interact with the existing genetic correlations between the sexes. Such a co-evolutionary approach is essential to gain a more complete understanding of the dynamics underlying life-history evolution. We will pursue this research in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, where we have considerable preliminary and background research on patterns of inheritance, social interactions, and behaviour. 

Consequently our overall objective is to test experimentally how evolution of repeated mating behaviour of female Nicrophorus vespilloides beetles affects the (co)evolution of traits involved in parental care and mating behaviour. Our proposed work examines the importance of social interactions among individuals in determining the co-evolutionary relationship between mating and parental care behaviours, from which mating systems and associated life-history traits of organisms arise as emergent properties. Our work will therefore form an important stepping stone towards the development of a new paradigm for understanding the evolution of mating systems and life-history traits of organisms based on behavioural interactions among family members.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
While this research is fully within the response mode, and therefore not directed toward specific clientele, we believe that there are general (non-scientific) beneficiaries to our work. The main targets for knowledge arising from this research, apart from other scientists, will be schools and students and the general public interested in science, behaviour, inheritance and evolution. These are perennially popular topics for society and the general public. The socio-economic impact for this work will be qualitative, rather than quantitative, and mostly involve human capital and outreach. Outreach will be actively pursued and occur at multiple levels including that directed to professionals, primary and secondary education teachers and their students. 

How will they benefit from this research?

Advancement of knowledge and public engagement with science - The highly influential Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) report published by the UN in October 2010, which was widely reported in the media, highlighted the global economic and societal benefits of biodiversity (www.teebweb.org). Understanding how best to manage and maintain biodiversity requires an understanding of the evolutionary processes that shape biodiversity. The general subject of this proposal, the evolution of life-histories, is a key component to understanding the mechanisms of evolution. For example, the recognition that evolution often occurs over much shorter timescales than previously realised has illuminated problems in the conservation and management of biodiversity such as over-harvesting of fish stocks and the threat of invasive species, which directly affect human health, wealth and well-being. Recent research showing that population and even ecosystem dynamics can be affected by how individuals interact with one another highlights the need for greater understanding of the co-evolutionary processes underlying the life-histories of species, as our proposal aims to do. We hope that by providing a wider appreciation of the importance of evolutionary processes in the maintenance and dynamics of biodiversity through targeted interactions with schools and the general public we will therefore be able to advance knowledge and enhance the public engagement with this important area of science. 

One of the oldest debates in research on behaviour is that over &amp;quot;nature versus nurture&amp;quot;, going back to at least Darwin's time. For example, Francis Galton invented regression specifically to address this issue. Thus, although our proposed research is &amp;quot;blue skies&amp;quot; - that is, it is hypothesis driven but addressing a general hypothesis that is not directed as a specific application - we hope that like Galton's contribution of regression, there will be spin-offs from our research that have wide-ranging and fundamental applications. We cannot predict this, of course, but it is now a truism that the majority of economically important benefits of government sponsored research come from unexpected added value of research rather than directed outputs. 

Human Capital - Human capital will be developed by training the PDRA and by engaging undergraduates directly in the research through existing training modules at Exeter. Exeter is committed to ensuring that researchers and students develop skills to match career paths by implementing a variety of training programmes. Exeter has a formal mentoring scheme for PDRAs, a formal yearly review process, and frequent training and development opportunities including training in teaching. The PDRA will be especially skilled in dealing with and communicating large and complex datasets. Perhaps the most widely transferable and important skill that this project will provide is the ability to successfully communicate complex ideas to a lay audience - a skill that is vital in all areas of employment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>429569</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press relaease (behavioural plasticity)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54F21993-A723-4142-A10A-3720270807B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Media coverage as a result of press release associated with Carter et al 2015 paper published in Evolution.

Mature males work harder and care less about female infidelity
Researchers at the University of Exeter found that older male burying beetles make better fathers than their younger counterparts. The study found that mature males, who had little chance of reproducing again, invested more effort in both mating and in parental care than younger males.
The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society of London - B, considered how the likelihood of paternity influenced the way that males cared for young. Older males were good fathers and looked after the young even when they were unsure whether the offspring were theirs. Younger males, who had a higher chance of reproducing again, tended to care less for offspring, particularly when they were uncertain of their paternity.
The survival and performance of the offspring remained the same regardless of the level of care provided by the males. This is because when the father stopped pulling his weight, the mother took up the slack and provided the additional care necessary to produce successful offspring.
Dr Megan Head from the University of Exeter said: &amp;quot;Our research shows that age has a direct impact on the level of parental care given by male burying beetles. If their chances of reproducing again were high, we found that males had to make a trade-off between the likelihood of paternity and the level of paternal care they would give. We found that younger males who were uncertain of their paternity were likely to make the worst fathers.&amp;quot;
Male perception of paternity was manipulated in the study by allowing the odours of competitor males to linger in the mating chamber. Males mating in an environment filled with the odours of other males had lower assurance of paternity than males that mated with females in an environment that did not smell of other males. Parental care was measured by the amount of time males spent with offspring.
Burying beetles have surprisingly complex parental care, which is similar in form to that provided by birds, such as robins or blackbirds; offspring beg to be fed by touching parents, who respond by regurgitating partially digested food. 
The results of the study support the hypothesis that in species with paternal care, fathers are expected to balance investment in future reproduction with care for current offspring to maximise their lifetime reproductive success. The results suggest females should prefer to mate with older males as they work harder and care less about infidelity.

2. No sex please, we're beetles
Sexual conflict during mating stops burying beetles caring properly for their young, say scientists.
The study, published in the journal Ecology Letters, aimed to understand the relationship between parentage and parental care provided by burying beetles to offspring. Specifically it looked at how sexual conflict may affect how behaviours involved in mating co-evolve with parental care behaviours. 
'Burying beetle babies beg for food from their parents, and the adults regurgitate partially digested food for them, in a similar way to birds like robins. This makes them ideal for studying parental care because they have quite a complex care structure for insects, but are easy to breed in the lab,' says Dr Nick Royle of the University of Exeter, lead author on the study
The team artificially selected burying beetles with the highest and lowest levels of mating for seven generations. 
'We selected for high or low repeated mating rates; the beetles are put in petri dishes and allowed to mate. We then take the top 30 per cent for number of times they mated in that half hour and the bottom 30 per cent,' says Royle. 
They then examined the offspring from different pairings to see if those with higher rates of mating were better or worse at caring for their offspring.
'Male parental care behaviour did not change in response to selection on mating rate, but females responded to selection for high mating rates with a reduction in parental care,' says Royle 
A pair with a female from a family line with a high mating rate gave much less care to offspring than those where the female came from a line with a low mating rate. 
'Both males and females provide care, but females provide the most, they're the primary care givers, as in humans,' explains Royle. 'So anything that reduces the ability of females to provide care will have a negative effect on offspring.'
The mother's ability to provide parental care and productivity - how many offspring she produces and how healthy they are -- was greatly reduced through frequent mating. This showed that patterns of parental care changed as a result of costs of mating to females, not paternity assurance in males. 
'We don't know what the actual costs are for females during mating. There's been a variety of studies that have looked at those costs; it might include physical harm but we're not sure about that yet,' explains Royle.

3. Love, love me do: male beetles that have more sex are more insecure, study shows


Males that mate more often are more insecure about their social status than those mating less, according to new research on the behaviour of burying beetles. 

The study, published today in the journal Evolution, provides new evidence that the social sensitivity of male behaviour is linked to how often male beetles mate.

Male burying beetles actively compete with each other for access to breeding resources such as dead mice, and when they find a suitable carcass will emit pheromones as a signal to attract females. But the emission of pheromones may also attract other males, leading to competition. Success in competition is determined by size: the larger you are compared to your rival, the more likely you will win out.

As a consequence, a dominant male and female pair, known as &amp;quot;resource holders&amp;quot; are usually established, who process the carcass and use it to raise their young. However, females and males who are not resource holders can adopt alternative reproductive tactics to increase the probability of their reproductive success. Subordinate females may lay eggs near the carcass and subordinate males adopt a &amp;quot;satellite&amp;quot; tactic, sneaking copulations with females. Females mating with multiple males creates uncertainty over paternity. 

Dr Nick Royle, of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter, said: &amp;quot;What is really fascinating is that this social sensitivity has evolved in response to selection on mating behaviour: males that have more sex really are more insecure about their social status. Our results therefore provide valuable insights as to how behavioural plasticity evolves.&amp;quot;

The researchers artificially selected burying beetles for either high mating rates or low rates. High mating rates offer paternity protection, i.e., the more you mate the more likely you are to be the father.

They found that beetles selected to mate at a high rate were more sensitive to how much larger or smaller than competitor males they were when they were a resource-holder compared to males selected for low mating rate: rapidly ramping up dominant behaviour when larger, but scaling down dominant behaviour when smaller, then their rival. 

As Dr Mauricio Carter explained: &amp;quot;Such flexibility of behaviour in response to a change in social context is a common, but relatively poorly understood, feature of organisms. Plasticity of behaviour is important because it allows organisms to respond rapidly to changes, increasing the persistence of populations in the face of environmental fluctuations. Our research increases our understanding of this important process that helps organisms adapt to changes in their environment.&amp;quot;

4. Small males have more sex appeal, new research shows

Female burying beetles are more attracted to small partners because they are less likely to get into fights, a study by researchers at the University of Exeter has found.

The research published today in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology found that while small male beetles were more successful at attracting female mates to the breeding ground of an animal carcass than larger males, they didn't make better parents.

In the first study of its kind carried out in the wild, researchers tested whether individual male burying beetles -- known for being exceptionally good parents in the insect world -- would help look after their current family for longer if they had clues that it might be difficult to find, or compete for, other mates.

The male beetles were placed in the wild with a dead mouse, an ideal place for them to mate and rear a family, and where they called for mates by releasing pheromones.

Unexpectedly, small males were more successful than large males at attracting a female partner to the carcass than a male rival, and researchers believe that this is because they attracted less competition and potential for squabbles.

Dr Paul Hopwood of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter's Penryn Campus, Cornwall, and lead researcher on the project, said: &amp;quot;These results show that by being choosy about their males, female burying beetles might avoid complicated relationships involving male fights and extra female competitors.&amp;quot;

The research, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), allowed male burying beetles to grow up and mature in the laboratory in groups with different ratios of males and females. This was to give individual males clues to the likely competition they might face, and the availability of females in the future before placing them with a carcass in the wild.

The findings showed that when the first beetle to arrive was female both beetles quickly settled down and bred as a pair. However, when a male turned up first, relationships got complicated and messy, when competition from other males led to fights.

The apparent allure of small males also led to them breeding more often in 'faithful' pairs than larger males.

In many species large males have more mating success than small males, either because females find them more attractive or because they can use their brawn to intimidate small rivals. They are also more likely to have more sexual partners and be less committed fathers.

In this case small males were more attractive but did not respond by being better parents. &amp;quot;We found no evidence that males of any size, or from any social background, were more committed parents,&amp;quot; added Dr Hopwood.

The study was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).


Too much sex causes genitals to change shape, beetle study shows


Sexual conflict between males and females can lead to changes in the shape of their genitals, according to research on burying beetles by scientists at the University of Exeter.

The study, published today in the journal Evolution, provides new evidence that conflict over how often mating takes place can lead to males evolving longer penis-like organs and females larger 'claws' on their genitalia, within ten generations. 

Genital shape varies enormously across the animal kingdom compared, for instance, to body shape. One reason for this may be that the shapes of male and female genitalia co-evolve as a result of sexual conflict. Dr Megan Head, one of the authors of the new study said: &amp;quot;It takes two to tango, so when changes in shape in one sex leads to corresponding changes in the other sex this is known as co-evolution.&amp;quot; 

Sexual conflict over mating occurs because, whilst having lots of sex is usually good for a male -- as it increases the number of offspring he is likely to produce -- it is not so good for a female because she only needs to mate a few times to fertilise all her eggs. In addition too much sex can be costly for female burying beetles as it reduces their ability to provide parental care. 

In order to test whether sexual conflict could lead to co-evolutionary changes in the shape of genitals the researchers artificially selected pairs of burying beetles for either high mating rates or low rates for ten generations. The research found that this artificial selection resulted in changes in the shapes of both male and female genitalia. 

It also found that changes in one sex were reflected by changes in the shape of the other sex, showing there was co-evolution. The greatest changes in shape occurred in beetles selected for high mating rates, where sexual conflict was greatest: males evolved to have longer intromittent organs (penis-like structures) and females responded by evolving more pronounced 'claws' on their genitalia. 

Dr Paul Hopwood, of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter, said: &amp;quot;Although we don't know the ins and outs of how these genital structures relate to the reproductive success of each sex, our results show that sexual conflict over mating can lead to co-evolutionary changes in the shape of the genitals of burying beetles.&amp;quot; 

He added: &amp;quot;Our research demonstrates the general importance of conflicts of interest between males and females in helping to generate some of the biodiversity that we see in the natural world. It's fascinating how genital evolution can happen so fast - in ten generations - showing how rapidly evolutionary changes can occur,&amp;quot; he added.

Selection on an antagonistic behavioral trait can drive rapid genital coevolution in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides by Paul E. Hopwood, Megan L. Head, Eleanor J. Jordan, Mauricio J. Carter, Emma Davey, Allen J. Moore &amp;amp; Nick J. Royle is published in the journal Evolution.
