Today, there exists a variety of formal authorization models to meet the wide needs of requirements in specifying access control policies. These include Discretionary Access Control, Mandatory Access Control and Role Based Access Control (RBAC). Recognizing the industry needs, RBAC has been widely deployed in most commercial software including Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Active Directory, and Oracle DBMS. Under RBAC, roles represent organizational agents that perform certain job functions, and permissions to access objects are grouped as roles. Users, in turn, are assigned appropriate roles based on their responsibilities and qualifications. During the past two decades, a number of extensions to the basic RBAC have been made to fit the needs of real-world sectors including mobile, manufacturing, healthcare, and financial services where access permissions need to be granted not only on the basis of roles that individual users possesses but also according to contextual information including the access request time, the user location, sequencing and temporal dependencies between permissions. UK NHS, for instance, implements a variant of RBAC that is able to capture complex policies expressing legitimate relationships and patient consent management. 

The need for security analysis: Analysis is essential to understand the implications of access control policies. Although each policy may appear innocent in isolation, their cumulative effect may lead to an undesirable authorization state. A study of the formal behavior of the access control system implemented, helps organizations gain confidence on the level of control they have on the resources they manage. Moreover, security analysis helps designers set policies so that owners do not unknowingly lose control on resources, and make changes to the policies only if the analysis yields no security violations. Policy analysis allows designers to gauge what security breaches could happen if several untrusted users started exploiting the rules to gain unintended permissions in the system. When employees gain more access than necessary, there are several risks: they could abuse that access, or lose information they have access to, or be socially engineered into giving that access to a malfeasant. Unfortunately, security breaches due to unintended access are frequent and can have significant implications including financial and reputation losses. The Vormetric Insider Threat Report (2015) remarks that privilege escalation, where users incrementally gain access rights beyond their requirements, usually as a result of job role changes, is a serious issue for many organizations. The IBM 2016 cyber security report shows that about 60% of recorded attacks have been carried out by insiders. 15% of such attacks involve inadvertent actors, for instance, when users' credentials are lost or stolen. Two recent examples are 1) at Sony when attackers gained unfettered access to the network through a set of stolen credentials, 2) and Home Depot, where a third-party air conditioning supplier with excessive access rights was hacked. Interestingly, the report also shows that the most critical sectors are healthcare, manufacturing and financial services. 

Aim of the Project: Several RBAC extensions have been proposed in order to fulfill the requirements of emerging and critical sectors, however, there is a lack of techniques and tools for analysing their security guarantees. The aim of this project is to reduce this key research gap by expanding the real-world scenarios in which security analysis of access control is useful and effective. Specifically, we aim at developing a framework for the security analysis of such policies that features a simple yet expressive for expressing policies as well as scalable solutions for checking their security guarantees.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work will have impact on three key areas.
Academic. This work covers the areas of information security, access control and verification; hence, researchers from these areas will be the primary beneficiaries. We will investigate theoretical and practical aspects that will lead to the design of a novel framework for the security analysis of dynamically evolving access control policies based on roles. Our approach will be empirically evaluated against real case studies. Our solutions translate access control systems to imperative programs that simulate the policy both precisely and abstractly, and then utilize further techniques from program analysis to analyze the programs in order to prove the policies secure. Our solutions are adapted from the field of program verification, and hence our insights gained in the access control setting can be fed back into both of these areas. We will contribute further benchmarks for the program verification community, in the form of programs produced by our translations. This will provide incentives to the developers of verification tools to take the characteristics of these programs into account. On a wider scale, this project will enable us to deepen our understanding of dynamically evolving access control systems based on roles, by learning from the analysis techniques we use to verify the policies we develop taking into account real case scenarios.

Industrial. The project aims at developing a framework for the security analysis of access control policies designed for the needs of real-world sectors including mobile, healthcare, manufacturing, and banking. Access control is a core aspect in organizations to enforce security policies in information systems. Security analysis of policies is essential to limit the damages caused to enterprises by security violations due to unintended breach of privileges. Access control not only prevents the malicious use of privileges by a user, it also protects networks from attacks involving inadvertent actors. For instance, when users' credentials are lost or stolen. Unfortunately, such cyber incidents are very frequent and often have severe implications including financial and reputation losses. Although RBAC and its variants are widely deployed to secure data in large organizations, there are no real industrial-strength tools to analyze RBAC policies for security. Administrators rely on intuition and discipline, and have no means of even testing whether a simple attack may be possible. As such the research methodologies and tools to be developed in this project will have a broader impact. The tool to be developed will be evaluated on policies from the literature and on the real case study we will develop around the UK NHS access control system.

Societal. Security breaches pose a growing threat not only to organizations but also individuals by making the privacy of users a primary concern. Most such incidents involve private information on individuals such as social security numbers and financial information. Personal data is a vulnerable asset and breaches involving such information harms society. As shown by recent cyber security reports, one of the most affected sectors is healthcare. Protected health information included in medical records, contains personal data that in the hands of criminals facilitates all types of crimes including prescription fraud, identity theft and the provision of medical care to a third party in the victim's name. Security cannot remain an afterthought. Security breaches negatively impact private and public sectors as well as individuals. This research will provide a means to mitigate the risks caused by attacks from insiders and inadvertent actors. The tool to be developed has the potential to help organisations to develop access control policies based on roles that are secure by design.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100745</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P022413/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
