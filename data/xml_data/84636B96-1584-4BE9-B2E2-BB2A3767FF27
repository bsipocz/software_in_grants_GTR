Approximately 20% of healthy humans persistently carry S. aureus in their nose, which is primary site of human colonisation for this bacterium. Nasal carriage is important because carriers are at much greater risk of S. aureus infection, and can transmit the organism to others. Like many other human traits, such as risk of cardiovascular disease, both an individual's genetics and lifestyle are thought to affect the constituents of the nasal microbiota. 

I will investigate the relative contributions of, and interplay between, host genetics, existing medical conditions and lifestyle have in shaping the nasal microbiota and specifically focusing on why certain people carry S. aureus persistently, while others do not. To do this I will screen blood donors who are already enrolled in a study that has measured extensive genetic and biological markers (e.g. blood groups, iron levels, etc). Having established which bacterial species (including S. aureus) make-up the nasal microbiota of the participants, I will identify those genetic and biological factors that influence the nasal microbiota and S. aureus carriage. 

Understanding how genetics and lifestyle shape the microbial populations that inhabit the human bodies will provide the fundamental insights that are required for development of new treatments for conditions caused by imbalance in our microbial populations. The long-term aims of my work are to use this information to bring health benefits to humans through the development of new ways to prevent S. aureus infection that occurs in carriers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The human nasal microbiota is a nutrient-limited environment inhabited by a variable range of bacterial species, including the important pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Approximately 20% of humans persistently carry S. aureus in their nose. The human nose is the primary ecological niche of S. aureus, and understanding the basis for persistence is fundamental to our understanding of its biology. Nasal carriage is also important because carriers are at much greater risk of S. aureus infection, and can act as the source of transmission on to others. The biological basis for composition of the nasal microbiota, and why some people carry the S. aureus is not understood, but variation in human genes and lifestyle may both have a role to play. 

I propose to identify the contribution of host genetics and phenotypes to the composition nasal microbiota and how this effects S. aureus carriage by carrying out a multidisciplinary study combining microbiome analysis and conventional microbiology with genome-wide and phenotypic association studies. I will screen healthy adults who have been extensively characterised both genetically and biologically for S. aureus carriage and will assess nasal microbiota composition by microbiome sequencing. I will identify the genetic and biological factors that influence the nasal microbiota and specifically S. aureus carrier status by carrying out a genome-wide and phenotypic association studies. 

The proposed research will shed new light on the interaction between host genetics, lifestyle and microbiome composition, and the biology of S. aureus carriage. Improved understanding of this fundamental aspect of the biology of S. aureus will help human health by identifying new ways to prevent S. aureus infections.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288284</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/S00291X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
