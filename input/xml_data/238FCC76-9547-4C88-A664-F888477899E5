How and why animals choose particular individuals as mates and avoid others are fundamental questions in evolutionary biology. However, they commonly make mate-choice decisions that we can not explain with existing theory, and inconsistencies in mate preferences between individuals are frequent. One possible explanation is that animals are responding to sensory information to which humans are not receptive, and so have overlooked. I propose that the use of chemical information by birds may be a prominent example. Birds are known to have a sense of taste, but the traditional view that they are microsmatic (have a poor sense of smell) has precluded significant research into this area. However, there is now convincing evidence that birds not only have a functional olfactory system, but can also detect and respond to olfactory stimuli in their environment in order to find food, navigate and even to recognise conspecifics and individuals. Remarkably, however, whether birds use chemical cues to assess the quality and suitability of potential mates (as commonly occurs in other vertebrates) has never been tested experimentally. In an entirely novel set of experiments, I will (a) investigate whether an individual's odour profile (that is, the unique combination of chemicals that compose their body odour) can encode information on the genetic relatedness of potential mates, how important odour is in relation to visual and vocal cues and how odour-based kin recognition develops. I will also (b) experimentally test whether specific volatile compounds identified on the feathers can be used by females to assess the quality of potential mates. I plan to use Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) as a model species. A huge amount is already known about their basic biology and, crucially, they are known to posses a good sense of smell. They are also known to suffer from severe inbreeding depression, and so have evolved the ability to discriminate between potential mates on the basis of their genetic relatedness; however, the cues they use are yet to be elucidated. I will address these questions using a combination of behavioural mate-choice assays and feather-odour analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This is an entirely new field of research with enormous potential for discoveries that could revolutionise our understanding of avian behaviour.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>89311</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Data resulting directly from this grant were used as part of a Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition on animal signalling (http://sse.royalsociety.org/2012/exhibits/animal-vision/).

The main findings of the research were:

(1) Feather odour profiles (i.e., the composition and abundance of volatile compounds present on the feathers, as determined analytically using GC-MS) were more similar between closely related individuals (e.g. brothers) than between unrelated individuals, and that individual odour profiles are temporally stable. Moreover, I also showed that similarity at a specific genetic region - the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc), which has been linked to individual and kin recognition in other taxa - partially explains both chick and adult social preferences, and that feather bacteria (specifically, their species composition and the volatiles they produce) provide a direct mechanistic link between an individual's genotype and their olfactory phenotype. 

(2) Quail are able to recognise genetically-similar individuals using kin-related olfactory cues and use this to inform their social behaviour. Specifically, chicks preferred to associate with genetically-similar individuals, while reproductively active adults preferentially selected genetically-unrelated individuals as mates. Olfactory cues are more important in kin recognition than visual or vocal cues for chicks, but non-odour cues are readily utilised by adults if olfactory information is unavailable. Odour preference experiments using synthetic odours designed to mimic those occurring naturally confirmed that quail can detect subtle variation in the volatile composition of odour profiles, specifically where this relates to variation between kin. 

(3) Experimental manipulation of antioxidant levels significantly altered odour profiles in both quail and ring-necked pheasants, suggesting that conspecifics may be able use odour to determine the antioxidant status of potential mates. I also found that males and females had distinctive odour profiles, with males expressing an androgen-linked compound and females having at least two sex-specific compounds in their profiles, although these were found to have no impact on mate choice decisions. 

In summary, these novel findings significantly advance our understanding of olfactory function and communication in birds, with implications for the evolution of olfactory signalling and olfactory-mediated behaviours. Exciting directions that this research is taking are in understanding olfactory-mediated embryo-parent interactions, the consideration of odour as a welfare concern in birds, and the use of feather odour as a tool to diagnose avian diseases.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results provide a solid basis for understanding odour and olfaction in one commercially important species (Japanese quail), and could act as a model for related species of commercial importance, including chickens, pheasants and turkeys. The results could be used to enhance welfare, by understanding how and why poultry respond to odours, and potentially to screen non-invasively for factors relating to health and disease, using feather volatiles.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4601DC09-6932-4B23-84EA-B9422E3420D2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2403648851.8152843779c9d5e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and
