It has been designed with the retired
or mobility restricted golfer in mind, and is proposed to enable the user to play a round of golf
without being able to walk the 4-6 miles courses usually cover. For this reason it has been
designed to collapse simply and to fit into an average car; lightweight, so that it is easily
picked up and put into the car; and sturdy. It is felt the ideas and technology would be
applicable to other models of similar transport conveyance.
Initial designs for the product have been created in conjunction with Coventry University.
The product has been designed to enable the user to be able to walk with it or ride on it, whilst
simultaneously carrying the golfer?s equipment. This is a unique three wheel design.
To move the project forward it is necessary to confirm the potential market for the product
and to indicate the market entry position. IP searches and patent registration is required.
There is also a need to identify an appropriate manufacturing partner to bring the product to
market.
Funding is being sought in order to enable the applicant to undertake this project with
minimal risk. Without the additional grant funding it will not be possible to identify the
necessary capital to undertake the project.
The applicant, Dudley Surgical Appliances, is an established and highly innovative provider
of orthopaedic and mobility products. The company manufactures specialist equipment to
meet the specific requirements of individuals and supplies, maintains and repairs a range of
mobility vehicles. The company has in depth knowledge of human biometrics, physical
restrictions and how these impact the product needs of the mobility restricted market. The
company is up to date with current developments in the mobility vehicle market and has a full
understanding of their application, manufacture and the breadth of the customer base.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20201</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">700064</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
