Although there has been regular study of the relationship between news output and politics, little serious attention has so far been paid to the way in which forms of drama and entertainment, modes of expression free from journalistic obligations and constraints, mediate political events and the sphere of politics itself. Yet the various formats in which politics is dramatized, joked about and expressed within entertainment are an important part of the way political ideas and feelings are circulated in everyday life. Forms of storytelling, fantasy, farce and satire provide a powerful and rich indicator of the relationship between a national political system and a national popular culture, acting both as expressions of, and as resources for, the wider play of imagination. The recent increase in the range and scale of media output, extending to 'web culture', has added to their significance but British broadcasting has a strong and fascinating record of dramas and situation comedies that variously depict political life, from Yes Minister to Party People, while stand-up and sketch comedy have regularly used topical political events as a staple part of their material.\n\nThere is growing interest both in the humanities and social sciences internationally in 'political culture', the broader settings of meaning and value within which politics is understood, judged and engaged with. Our study aims to take its cue from this interest and to develop further understanding and improved conceptualisation based on empirical findings. \n\nSuch an inquiry is made particularly pertinent at a time when British politics is undergoing a number of shifts in its party-political identity and its stylings as well as in the kinds of domestic and international challenges it faces. Questions about 'spin', party 'branding', the funding of political activities and the perceived widespread mistrust of politicians have all variously become salient themes in the national culture, as have the various attempts of politicians to announce a 'new politics' which offers fresh terms of public transparency and honesty. \n\nOur study has been devised as an 'audit' of a four month period, during which a wide but inevitably selective range of broadcast and printed media items will be collected. These will be subjected to analysis using qualitative software, first of all to help produce a broad profile of their topics, treatments, visualizations, language, tone, judgments, etc., and then to aid a closer interpretation in relation to the generic 'work' they perform upon political circumstances, events and people. For instance, what are the recurrent terms and phrases (both of description and judgment) by which the world of politics is portrayed? What are perceived as the primary characteristics of politicians as a group? How varied are the criteria by which political performance is judged and sometimes found wanting or even ridiculous? How much portrayal relates to structures as well as to people and events? The material gathered here, and its analysis, will be taken over into a further phase of work with respondent groups, who will be invited to talk about it in the context of their own routine use of the media genres and their engagement with, and assessment of, political themes. An unfunded pilot study by the Principal and Co-Investigator into the 2009 Party Conference season will precede the research.\n\nThis research will have notable impact within the academic community because it will open up, through a focused empirical study, this under-examined but extremely salient dimension of contemporary cultural life.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152511</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The impact has been primarily within the academic community in respect of citations and use for teaching purposes though as the main output is a book, the teaching impact will be slight until after the paperback comes out (due January 2015).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>13DBDDB2-0D0B-4E53-8F33-740D6B0D55A6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54478a3a7beb00.35351908</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our first journal article was written for a Media Studies journal and was presented as a case study of one particular month in British mediated politics, February 2010. We focused on the ramifications of one particular topic (MPS expenses) across a variety of genres, and then on one particular programme (Tower Block of Commons, a Channel 4 reality TV series). The second journal article was for a sociolinguistics journal and discussed the history and form of parliamentary sketch columns in British newspapers which have sustained a long tradition of comic writing about politics for a mass audience. After that we turned our attention to the General Election and wrote about the non-news mediations of politics that surrounded the events of the campaign and its aftermath, for an edited collection of articles about the election in the media most of which were more concerned with news itself. Our fourth article, for a politics journal, focused on the media fortunes of the Liberal Democrat leadr Nick Clegg, who was almost unknown in February but a major celebrity by May. A fifth article, for a media studies journal,came out at the end of 2012 and focused on the role of comedy in mediated politics. Some of these pieces (especially the last one) also draw on material collected during the audience research phase of our project where, with varying results, we 'asked the audience' to comment on items from our database. We have also published a book, extending the range of examples beyond those reviewed in these five pieces and also developing more thematic analyis and more audience analysis, along with the textual analysis which distinguishes between broadcast, print and online materials. Another more indirect academic offshoot of the research was an article on television political drama more generally (i.e., including material not harvested in the course of the funded research).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Should be of intellectual value to policymakers and those who advise them, with OFCOM being the most obvious governmental body likely to take an interest.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>97C19E92-73A1-420B-8189-323EDF111B67</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9549048645.001883779259de</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.liv.ac.uk/communication-and-media/Staff/politicalculture.htm</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>695D0F6F-5F8E-4533-800E-E3275A100F42</gtr:id><gtr:title>Political Values and Television Drama</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ccb21eca87bbed4e59977621ded7e2f8"><gtr:id>ccb21eca87bbed4e59977621ded7e2f8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pia S.
