They are profoundly shaped by human choices and trade-offs between competing claims to water. Current practices for management of droughts in the UK have largely evolved from experience. Each drought tests institutions and society in distinctive ways. Yet it is questionable whether this empirical and heuristic approach is fit for purpose in the future, because the past is an incomplete guide to future conditions. 

The MaRIUS project will introduce and explore a risk-based approach to the management of droughts and water scarcity, drawing upon global experiences and insights from other hazards to society and the environment. MaRIUS will demonstrate, in the context of real case studies and future scenarios, how risk metrics can be used to inform management decisions and societal preparedness. Enquiry will take place at a range of different scales, from households and farms to river basins and national scales. Fine-scale granular analysis is essential for understanding drought impacts. Aggregation to broader scales provides evidence to inform critical decisions in water companies, national governments and agencies. Analysis on a range of timescales will demonstrate the interactions between long-term planning and short-term decision making, and the difference this makes to impacts and risks.
 
Underpinning the risk-based approach to management of water scarcity, the MaRIUS project will develop an integrated suite of models of drought processes and impacts of water scarcity. A new 'event set' of past and possible future hydroclimatic drought conditions will enable extensive testing of drought scenarios. The representation of drought processes in hydrological models at catchment and national scales will be enhanced, enabling improved analysis of drought frequency, duration and severity. Models for assessment of the risks of harmful water quality, in rivers and reservoirs, will be developed. The representation of drought impacts in models of species abundance and biodiversity in rivers and wetland ecosystems, such as fens, lowland and upland bogs, will be enhanced. A model of agricultural practices and output will be used to analyse drought impacts on agriculture and investigate the benefits of preparatory steps that may be taken by farmers. The potential economic losses due to water scarcity will be analysed through a combination of 'bottom-up' study of households and businesses, and consideration of supply chain dependence on drought-sensitive industries. 

The environmental, economic and social dimensions of water scarcity will be synthesised into a computer visualisation tool (an 'impacts dashboard'). This will enable exploratory analysis of feedbacks between impacts. For example, agricultural land use changes, driven in part by drought frequency, will, in turn, influence water quality and ecosystems. The interdisciplinary analysis will enable comparison of likely outcomes arising from applying both pre-existing drought management arrangements (e.g. restrictions on water use, abstraction limits) and enhanced/innovative management strategies (e.g. use of outlook forecasts, dynamic tariffs).

Social science and stakeholder engagement are deeply embedded in the MaRIUS project, which will be framed by a critical analysis of how impacts of droughts and water scarcity are currently understood and managed by key stakeholders, and how this is shaped by institutions, regulation and markets. First-hand experience and 'collective memory' of communities affected now, and historically, by water scarcity will provide new understandings of the social and cultural dimensions of droughts. On-going engagement between the project social scientists, natural scientists and stakeholders will help to ensure that the outputs from the MaRIUS project, including the 'impacts dashboard', are matched to their needs and to the evolving policy context.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Droughts are one of the headline strategic risks to the UK. In 2012 the UK experienced the driest spring in over a century, after two dry winters. Ministers faced the prospect of water shortages during the London Olympics. Whilst the drought conditions in early 2012 served as a wake-up call, the potential for water shortages in the UK, driven by changing patterns of demand and changing climatic conditions, had already been recognised. In the Thames Water region alone it is estimated that severe water rationing could potentially result in economic losses of &amp;pound;300million/day. The capacity for the natural environment to recover from periods of very low flows, deteriorated water quality, dry soils and hot temperatures is not well understood.

The MaRIUS project aims to provide new evidence and insights to minimise and manage the harmful impacts of droughts and water scarcity to the environment, society and the economy. It will provide benefits through the improved management of risks and more inclusive, transparent, effective and efficient arrangements for risk management.

The expected beneficiaries are:
1. Organisations with responsibility for the management of droughts and water scarcity, who will benefit from improved evidence of the risks of droughts and potential impacts of water scarcity. These organisations include water utilities, regulators (EA, Ofwat) and government (Defra and the devolved administrations). Improved information will enable better management of scarce resources and inevitable trade-offs during periods of water scarcity. A multi-attribute understanding of risk will enable the development of new indicators and trigger points for the management of droughts. Decision makers (including senior executives and ministers) will be provided with a more nuanced and accurate assessment of risks and the implications of different management options. Adoption of a risk-based approach to drought management will enable more explicit treatment of uncertainty nd more proportionate allocation of resources to risk reduction.
2. Communities and businesses who may be impacted by droughts and water scarcity, including domestic and industrial water users and farmers, who will benefit from more transparent and risk-informed management of droughts. These benefits will be achieved indirectly through uptake of new science and methodologies by the organisations mentioned in (1) and also via the direct interaction and communication with communities, NGOs and other stakeholders that are planned as part of the MaRIUS project.
3. The natural environment and organisations with responsibility for, or an interest in, protecting the environment from the impacts of droughts and water scarcity, including Natural England, the EA, wildlife trusts and rivers trusts, who will benefit from better understanding of the risks of droughts to the natural environment and the impacts of management options designed to reduce the risks of water scarcity. Involvement in the research will help to ensure that environmental impacts of water scarcity are given appropriate weight alongside water users.

The MaRIUS project is in a strong position to deliver these impacts. The consortium has long-standing links with the stakeholder community, and outstanding experience of delivering impacts from previous projects. The MaRIUS project has a carefully developed dissemination plan and strategies to promote uptake and impact. Jointly with Project Partners in government and industry, we will target decisions taking place during and after the project (e.g. Abstraction reform, Water Resources Management Planning Guideline, EA Water Company Drought Plan Guideline) and processes (e.g. Water Score-Card, Water Situation Report, Hydrological Outlook) where the proposed research is likely to have most impact. Joint work on drought case studies and scenario analyses with our Project Partners will test methodologies and promote applied uptake of the research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>382325</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Dr Dolores Rey speaks on the evidence of increasing resilience in the irrigated agricultural sector to water scarcity and drought</gtr:description><gtr:id>F8350B2D-3A77-4C24-A269-64DA0CA7BAA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of the project research</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9443ab7ad43.87236962</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Podcast - Impact of drought and water scarcity on agriculture</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/impact-drought-and-water-scarcity-agriculture</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Environment Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Environment Agency collaboration on abstraction restriction</gtr:description><gtr:id>306625BC-9B87-43E1-9493-5CBA6FC9ED06</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MSc thesis: Hall B (2015).

This work is also supported by the National Farmers Union and the UK Irrigation Association to deliver wider non-academic impacts. Results from the MaRIUS project (in conjunction with the D-Risk project) on risk of irrigation abstraction constraints associated with reduced abstraction licence volume under drought conditions were presented to the Head of Abstraction Reform at Defra - the methodology being used to assess the reduced abstraction licence volumes subsequently was modified. Outputs from the MaRIUS project are being by Cranfield University used within the multi-stakeholder &amp;quot;Water Resources East&amp;quot; project to plan a long term water resource strategy for the east of England for the next 100 years.

The MARIUS project has organised three annual Drought Symposia in which Cranfield have actively participated, which had a positive effect of raising awareness, and discussions with industry practitioners, some of whom gave presentations. Members of the project team have engaged with many different non-academic stakeholders from water companies, NGOs, regulators, government bodies and others.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>66462382-F2E2-48A7-BB10-656A7CD678D4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cde5cb9c8be9.10184972</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Results showed that farmers have adapted their irrigated businesses to become more resilient to drought, despite increasing water scarcity, due to investments in alternative water sources, improved farm drought planning, collective action through the formation of Water Abstractor Groups and improved working relationships with the regulator during times of drought. However, the benefits of this have been amplified by the way the Regulator manages drought has also evolved over time, changing to a more proactive attitude, recognising the importance of having irrigators involved in the drought management decisions and providing them better forecast and information on which to based farm-decisions. The importance of this vertically integrated management of droughts to reduce the impacts at the farm level is clear to farmers. Research has suggested that climate change will have regionally different impacts on irrigators across England, with irrigators in the west likely to face increased risk of abstraction restrictions due to summer low flow conditions whilst irrigators in the east will face increased risk of having insufficient licenced water to meet future demands</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Results likely to be taken into account by farmer representatives in their promotion of bottom-up approaches to catchment management of drought events</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BC6CF286-7F20-460A-967C-3944C54E990D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cde53f98acb0.02635070</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Development and delivery of M-level module on &amp;quot;Drought and Water Scarcity&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E2D2D4C-E6AD-463E-8105-B415E4ED2BCE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>589ca2874ebc26.75537391</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Input into Water Resources East</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF85C634-77F2-4F53-809E-D6CD303E7EA1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b84eacb7d4c1.73410669</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The D-Risk tool combines farm business information (crop types, irrigation methods and areas), abstraction licence data (source, annual and daily abstraction limits, reservoir storage) and meteorological data (from the MaRIUS project) to derive farm irrigation need and the risk of having insufficient licence volume under current and future climate variability.
