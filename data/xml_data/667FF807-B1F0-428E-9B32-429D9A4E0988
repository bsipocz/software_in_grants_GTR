A possible explanation for this is that intestinal helminth infections have the potential to bias antibody responses to malaria. Helminth infected individuals respond to malaria infection predominantly by the production of so called non-cytophilic antibodies that are not protective.||Comparatively little is known about the interaction of malaria and lymphatic filariasis or Onchocerciasis, mainly because definitive cure for these diseases is hard to achieve. Recently, studies carried out in malaria endemic areas have shown that treatment with doxycycline is effective against these pathogens, resulting in the killing of the adult worms.||Using serum samples from these studies we investigated if the clearance of the adult worms results in an altered antibody profile against malaria.||We found that the profiles of malaria specific antibodies were similar before and after treatment of filarial worms.||Importantly, the malaria-antibody profile observed in Ghanaian patients infected with filarial worms prior to treatment was similar to that seen in studies in the Gambia, where filarial infections are virtually absent. This suggests that infection with filarial worms may not affect the quality of the antibody response to malaria infection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A series of immuno-epidemiological studies suggests that infection with intestinal helminths is associated with an increased relative risk of clinical malaria.||Helminth infections are known to drive the immune responses towards the production of non-cytophilic antibody subclasses (IgG2, IgG4 and IgM). In contrast, protection against malaria is associated with antibodies of the cytophilic subclasses IgG1 and IgG3, and it has therefore been hypothesized that the imbalance of antibody isotypes caused by chronic intestinal worm infections may be responsible for the delayed acquisition of malaria immunity, and thus explain the higher incidence of malaria in helminth infected individuals.||Little is known about the interaction between filarial infection with Onchocerca volvulus or Wuchereria bancrofti and malaria, but murine co-infection models with the filarial worm Litomosoides sigmodontis and Plasmodium berghei suggest that filarial infection prevents the development of cerebral malaria in subsequent Plasmodium berghei infection.||In 2 randomized placebo controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of doxycycline on onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, Professor Hoerauf and co-workers observed that doxycycline can kill the adult worms. Two years post-treatment the prevalence of female adult worms was reduced by 70% (Onchocerciasis) and 80% (lymphatic filariasis), respectively. Both studies were carried out in areas where malaria is holoendemic, and serum samples are available from time points prior to treatment, as well as 6, 20 and 27 months (Onchocerciasis) and 4, 12 and 24 months (lymphatic filariasis) thereafter.||To test weather successful macrofilaricidal treatment with Doxycycline would affect the isotype profile of malaria-specific antibodies, sera from these study participants obtained at the beginning and the end of the observation period were screened by ELISA.||The antibody isotype profiles to malaria antigens were similar before and after treatment of filarial worms, no isotype class switching was observed.||Importantly, the malaria-antibody isotype profile observed in Ghanaian patients infected with filarial worms prior to treatment was similar to that seen in studies in the Gambia, where filarial infections are virtually absent. This suggests that infection with filarial worms may not induce an isotype class switching of malaria-specific antibodies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>335948</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U190088480</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
