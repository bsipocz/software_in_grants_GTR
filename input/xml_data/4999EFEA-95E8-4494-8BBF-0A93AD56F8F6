Many of these systems are in fact interlinked, forming complex networks across many different cell types. Due to this complexity, we will adopt an interdisciplinary approach. In particular we will use mathematical modelling and molecular biology experiments that can measure components of the system on cells of the immune system. We will focus on the NFAT signalling system as our paradigm, because when it fails or is modified in some way it is implicated in many diseases. The knowledge that comes out of this, aims to help not only in developing new therapeutics to treat these diseases, but also in determining the effectiveness of a drug on an individual by measuring the consequence it has on the signalling network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Many cell types respond to extracellular signals with an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of the phosphatase Calcineurin (Cn). In vertebrates, Cn de-phosphorylates the cytoplasmic components of NFAT transcription complexes (NFATC1-C4, Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells, Cytoplasmic component 1-4), resulting in their nuclear entry. In the nucleus, NFAT proteins and several co-factors assemble on DNA and activate transcription. Nuclear entry is counterbalanced by kinases such as DYRK1A and GSK3b, which phosphorylate NFAT molecules promoting their nuclear export. In addition, RCAN1 (encoded by the DSCR1 gene) is a molecule that inhibits Cn function thereby acting as a negative regulator of NFAT.||One of the remarkable features of NFAT signalling is its positive and negative feedback control. In fact, NFATC1 and C4 are known to activate their own promoters, therefore establishing a positive feedback loop, while expression of RCAN1 is also controlled by NFAT, yielding a negative feedback loop (See cover figure for details). This pathway is also the target of the immunosuppressive drugs Cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, which inhibit Cn within minutes, allowing both effective treatment of organ transplant patients at nM concentrations as well as rapid and precise loss-of-function experiments.|Cn/NFAT signalling regulates many aspects of vertebrate development and organogenesis, and failure of proper signalling has been associated with a variety of human diseases. These include defects in the immune system, propensity to AIDS, failure of proper patterning of the vascular and nervous system, heart valve malformations and mental retardation. More recently, the NFAT network has been considered as a possible site of perturbation to cure osteoporosis and juvenile diabetes. In addition, instabilities in this pathway have been shown to promote aberrant cell proliferation in breast and prostate cancer, and leukaemia. One of NFATs major targets is the angiogenesis factor VEGF, among the most promising targets for cancer drugs for solid tumors.||We are interested in measuring and quantifying all the necessary kinetic parameters and the absolute mRNA and protein concentrations of the constituents of the Calcineurin/NFAT signalling pathway in a variety of tissues. In addition, we will use mathematical modelling to simulate and accurately predict the associated spatio-temporal dynamics and to discover new pathway modulators. By means of computational predictions and experimental verification of the complex combinatorial logic, tissue specificity and DNA binding properties of the NFAT transcription complexes, we seek to extend the circuit above and to simulate its in vivo dynamic properties.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1674184</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Synthetic and Systems Biology Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>5A3DEC82-26CA-44A6-AE2E-0DB4D5F43D63</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Students of Central Saint Martins College of Art &amp;amp; Design attended the workshop which led to over 10 working groups with the task of generating a design project.
