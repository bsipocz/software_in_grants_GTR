Despite this the vertical transmission from broiler and layer breeders to production flocks has been identified by the European food safety agency as the most likely route of transfer of antibiotic resistant e-coli and salmonella. There is also the opportunity for transmission of micro-organisms to occur during the collection and transport of eggs. Irrespective of the route or site of transfer, the entry of micro-organisms harmful to the egg contents is undesirable for food safety, animal and human health.

The cuticle is a protein layer which covers the surface of the egg and fills the gas exchange pores in the shell through which the embryo 'breathes'. The cuticle forms the first line of defence to the penetration of bacteria derived both from transmission in the cloaca (where the egg and faeces exit the chicken) and transmission from the environment e.g. contact with collecting belts or handling equipment. 

In preliminary studies we have been able for the first time to quantify the cuticle deposition on eggs using a relatively cumbersome two-stage process and estimate the importance of genetics for this trait (heritability, 0.27). This suggested that the trait has good potential for genetic selection to improve it. We also have evidence that the natural variation in cuticle deposition is responsible for differences in the ability of bacteria to penetrate the egg. This demonstrated that eggs with good cuticle deposition were never penetrated by E. coli whereas eggs with poor cuticle quality were frequently penetrated. This means that selection for better cuticle deposition will reduce micro-organism contamination of eggs.

In this proposal we will address the physiochemical, physiological and genetic parameters that characterise the cuticle and use this information to develop a simple one step measurement tool for cuticle assessment using the natural fluorescence of the cuticle. Both the amount and the degree to which the proteins are modified by the addition of sugar residues (glycosylation) will be quantified. In the first instance this will be achieved using a matrix of wavelengths of light both shone on and emitted from the egg surface. This will allow the wavelengths to be selected which can best distinguish the cuticle from potential interfering substances such as feather debri or pigment. A simple to use measurement tool will be built using this information. The amount of modification of the cuticle proteins by sugar residues will be assessed by how they change the rate at which the emission of fluorescent light occurs. 

Both measurements will be used to estimate reliably the contribution of genetics to variation in cuticle coverage in meat and egg laying strains of poultry. We will also determine genetic correlations with important production parameters to ensure there are no major negative consequences that might occur when the cuticle is selected for. As well as the contribution of genetics to variation in the trait, we will measure the contribution of environmental influences such as stress, age and how the hormones involved in the expulsion of the egg control cuticle deposition. 

In the project we will also characterise how the cuticle and its degree of modification by sugars acts both as a physical and a chemical barrier to bacteria and extend our understanding of the genes involved with cuticle formation and their expression.

Overall this will provide the information required to allow accurate genetic selection for improved cuticle coverage to reduce the risk of pathogens entering the egg. We will also gain fundamental knowledge about the biological mechanisms which give rise to the cuticle and its role as a physical and chemical barrier to microbial penetration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The cuticle is a glycosylated protein layer which covers the external surface of the egg and fills the gas exchange pores through which the embryo 'breathes'. The cuticle is critical to minimising the risk of vertical and horizontal transmission of pathogenic or zoonotic organisms to the egg contents which is un-desirable for food safety, animal and human health. This project will use physiochemical, physiological and genetic methods to provide the information and tools necessary to make precision genetic selection for improved cuticle quality in both meat and egg laying hens. 
 The objective of the work is; 
1) to use excitation-emission-matrix spectroscopy to determine the parameters for discrimination of the cuticle from background fluorescence and to design and build an instrument that can rapidly and accurately measure cuticle coverage,
2) to apply this direct measurement to estimate reliable heritabilities for cuticle coverage in meat and egg laying strains of poultry and to determine genetic correlations with important production parameters to ensure there are no major negative consequences,
3) to test the hypothesis that (i) moderate levels of stress, (ii) events determining the timing of oviposition and (iii) bird age influences the level of cuticle coverage and to estimate the contribution of these environmental factors to cuticle variation,
4) to develop a method to measure the degree of glycosylation of the cuticle using time resolved fluorescence,
5) to test the hypothesis that the cuticle and its degree of glycosylation acts both as a physical and a chemical barrier to bacteria using penetration and recovery experiments with a range of GFP bacteria,
6) Using animals killed during the transition from shell to cuticle formation and oviposition we will profile the expression of genes to increase our understanding of the control of cuticle formation. We will also specifically measure genes we know from proteomic studies that encode cuticle proteins.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principle benefit from this research will be a reduction in the transmission of potential pathogens from parent to offspring via the egg of poultry. In particular organisms of enteric origin such as E Coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium Perfringens all of which reduce growth, health and welfare and are known zoonotics.

This is of benefit to the poultry industry where birds that lay eggs with good cuticles will result in savings to farmers all the way down the production chain with reduced losses and better protection from disease. For E. Coli infection alone it is estimated that the cost for a typical farm is in the region of &amp;pound;360,000 per annum (World Poultry Vol. 25 No. 5, 2009). With continual pressure to remove antibiotics any system that improves natural antimicrobial defence is important. 

The proposal also addresses the concerns of governmental agencies such as the European Food Safety Authority which has identified vertical transmission of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria in poultry as a major source of flock infection and an impediment to creating clean flocks.

The development of a simple tool and its application to breeding poultry will therefore ultimately reduce the risk to consumers and improve the safety and sustainability of poultry production by utilizing the natural antimicrobial defenses of the egg. 

The development of methods to measure the cuticle will be of interest to a range of academics involved in the poultry industry and in wild birds and may provide commercial opportunities. The novel techniques for measuring glycosylation are likely to have interest across biological disciplines and would have wide application beyond that envisaged in the proposal.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>128709</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Festivals</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>18D4BFCE-1DC4-4BA4-BC75-2D95A15BEE11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of a Beltane grant and workshop an activity was built up to engage the public including children in the research.

The results indicated that we can select for cuticle in all lines and that one measurement in the life of a hen was adequate to estimate its genetic potential. We now have a clear idea of how we need to implement a quantitative measurement of the cuticle for practical use. We have produced a machine with high throughput which should facilitate the ultimate implementation in breeding programmes. We are continuing to work with the companies to overcome any obstacles to implementation. However all signs are that a major effort is going to be made to incorporate this measure so we should succeed in our efforts to reduce vertical transmission of micro-organisms between generations. The other major output has been a greater understanding and clarification of cuticle deposition physiology. Specifically the timing of the deposition, its susceptibility to environmental factors, the reliance on hormonal signals and the precise location of deposition, most of these points were not proven in the literature before we started. This will help the research community to design further experiments to characterize the nature and the mechanisms of cuticle deposition.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>63998621-B2A1-4599-993F-B42493915779</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc8a53cdb36.49621822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>we have establishment of a number of methods to potentially measure cuticle coverage on eggs in a high throughput manner. These have now been tested on a number of lines of egg and meat type chickens. One method has emerged as being the most practical. 
Our partners at Roslin has also established basic facts about the deposition of the cuticle which can manipulate to be absent or present using endocrine tools.
Genetic parameters so far are promising in particular in the brown egg laying hen and in broiler breeder hens the cuticle deposition towards the beginning of lay is predictive of the hens deposition of cuticle nearer the end of lay. Most importantly in all the lines tested the better the cuticle the less bacteria penetrate the egg. This strongly supports the hypothesis that selecting hens for better cuticle will minimize the chances of bacterial contamination of the egg contents.
More specifically in relation to knowledge on the nature of the cuticle; The cuticle is a unique oviduct secretion that protects avian eggs from bacterial penetration through gas exchange pores. Despite its importance, experimental evidence is lacking for assertions on where, when and what is responsible for its deposition. By using knowledge about the ovulatory cycle and its relationship to oviposition we have been able to manipulate cuticle deposition to get evidence on these key points. Cuticle deposition was measured using staining and spectrophotometry. Experimental evidence supports the shell gland pouch (uterus) of the oviduct as the location of cuticle deposition and not the vagina and this occurs within the final hour before oviposition. Oviposition induced by arginine vasotocin or prostaglandin, the penultimate and ultimate factors for the induction of oviposition produces an egg with no cuticle, therefore these factors are not responsible for cuticle secretion. Conversely oviposition induced by GnRH, which mimics the normal events of ovulation and oviposition, results in a normal cuticle. There is no evidence that cuticle deposition differs at the end of a clutch and therefore there is no evidence that the ovulatory surge of progesterone effects cuticle deposition. Overall the results demonstrate that the cuticle is a specific secretion and is not contiguous with the organic matrix. It was demonstrated that a stressor reduced cuticle deposition and whilst the cuticle probably contains some of the pigment that give eggs their colour there is no absolute inter-dependence of pigment and cuticle. Defining the basic facts surrounding cuticle deposition will aid efforts to reduce contamination of eggs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Lessons learned from use of the prototypes will be incorporated in further versions to improve measurement and use. A prototype commercial device has been built and tested using that knowledge. It is hoped this practical tool will be used to further validate the conclusions and help breeders to improve biosecurity. Current indications are that breeders are going to invest in the technology and try it on a larger scale to validate its usefulness. The observations on the cuticle deposition indicate that an oviposition produced by AVT does not result in a cuticle being formed . This demonstrates that the cuticle is a specific layer which is added just prior to oviposition and it is not simply contiguous with the shell matrix. We have ruled out a number of factors in the normal process of inducing an ovulation/oviposition that do not stimulate secretion of the cuticle but we have not yet identified what does prompt its deposition. However the methods developed do give us powerful tools to dissect this in the future. The genetic parameters suggest that for all lines of hen tested the method can be adopted to improve cuticle and reduce contamination. There seems to be no major negative correlations. So the method has we believe universal application.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AFFCC91F-39EB-4EE6-A89A-BE361E99724B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6f9f2f7f15.91574642</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://lomondinstruments.com/li200-ecutimeter-summary/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Implementation of cuticle assessment as part of selection criteria</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9EFB8995-BC93-4167-8081-260F239A4B01</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dde65c130c48.72091885</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Genetic calculations for cuticle deposition including heritability and genetic correlations with other important production traits are now possible for a meat and 2 egg laying lines of chicken.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7FDEE954-2E24-406F-B85E-80039FC6EE98</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We now have evidence that there is a strong genetic basis to cuticle deposition making it possible to incorporate this trait into breeding programs for improved egg quality and safety</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd83c18900c9.24370525</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Genetics calculations on cuticle deposition in egg and meat type chickens</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Custom designed system for the rapid assessment of cuticle deposition using spectrophotometry.
