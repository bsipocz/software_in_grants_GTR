This project explores how clothing and technology can be designed to improve mobility amongst individuals with associated health conditions, leading to improved confidence and subsequent improvements in self-esteem which are key factors in improving an individual's wellbeing and quality of life. Through the application of advanced technology and design, this project seeks to develop new wearable smart clothing concepts with direct relevance to a range of mobility and health issues. Current textile products do not provide satisfactory solutions for individuals with serious health issues wishing to maintain an active and independent lifestyle. They may alleviate certain aspects of a medical condition, however they don't address the full range of an individual's needs. The proposal seeks to investigate a range of new technologies including micro-electronics and new materials in order to develop advanced clothing that can be used to improve particular aspects affecting an individual's ability to participate in normal everyday activities. The project will adopt a co-design model in which end users are involved at the start of the project to ensure a close fit between need, technology and eventual implementation. A multi-disciplinary team of researchers will share expertise across the fields of fashion, textiles and product design, advanced materials, computing and life sciences. A unique aspect of this project is the bringing together of participants with debilitating medical conditions, designers, technologists, together with industrial collaborators with a view to developing a direct mechanism for the commercial exploitation of design outcomes. The approach involves the use of both lo-tech and hi-tech tools, both virtual and real, to rapidly create concepts for immediate feedback and further development for commercialization and potential customization. Understanding how conditions affect people's lifestyles is of fundamental importance in providing solutions. A focus group comprising of individuals representing different age groups and medical needs and mobility issues will be used to provide insights into key issues that need to be addressed by the designed outcomes. They will also be asked to assist in the evaluation of concepts. Concepts might include both passive and active technologies designed to have a direct effect on the individual's mobility. 
This project will provide an opportunity to look for synergies between advanced technologies and new materials. The project will prototype and visualize new solutions which can be implemented with the aid of commercial partners. Developing new products to tackle some of these problems can be very expensive and long-term, and is often seen as not being commercially viable however this project will provide a mechanism for developing new concepts in a way that is not open to a standard development route and therefore is much more likely to result in practical solutions with a high probability of adoption. This will involve adopting an open innovation approach, creating an 'ideas bank' website to showcase the concepts. Anyone wishing to develop the concepts will be encouraged to contribute via the ideas bank.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Individuals with a health condition which directly affects their physical mobility
