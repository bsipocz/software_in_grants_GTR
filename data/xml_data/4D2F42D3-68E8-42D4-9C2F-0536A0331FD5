&lt;p>A key aim was to consult with cultural sector representatives with expertise in evaluation, and whose organisations had different and competing interests, to see if any consensus could be reached on appropriate sector-wide measures of cultural value. This was achieved though discussion threads on a blog hosted by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and by organising two stakeholder workshops. There was unanimous support for the holistic approach. Desk-based work found that using economic valuation techniques alone to value culture was unrealistic in practice. This was due to the lack of a sufficient foundation of relevant economic valuation studies, and the prohibitive costs of conducting such studies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project concluded that DCMS adopt a holistic and consultative approach to valuing our culture, recognising a combination of economic and non-economic approaches are valid, depending on context; and that DCMS develop clear and detailed guidance on using economic and non-economic valuation techniques.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There three main groups of potential beneficiaries of this Fellowship are government, the cultural sector, and other research funding organisations.

More impact is likely to occur if key stakeholders are engaged with the research process. Therefore, stakeholder workshops will be the arena where the key project decisions are made. Involving key stakeholders in the research from the very beginning, and empowering them to decide which indicators to test and adopt, is a fundamental part of project's consensus-building role. This consensus-building between government and cultural sector interests will be an immediate benefit from the research.
The workshops will be held with an expert advisory group comprised of policymakers and practitioners within government (e.g. DCMS, Treasury), stakeholder institutions (e.g. Arts Council, British Museum), key arts and gallery curators, cultural economists, and arts and humanities academics. Recruitment will initially draw on stakeholders from Phase 1 of 'Measuring Cultural Value', thus helping to maximise the impact of the first placement Fellowship and to provide a sense of continuity.

This stakeholder involvement will also give more credibility to the final report's recommendations (including the evaluation toolkit) among the cultural sector and within government (DCMS, HM Treasury).
The most desirable potential medium- to long-term impact would be the adoption and development of the evaluation 'toolkit' by government and the cultural sector. This toolkit would help to build a strong evidence-based case for investment in the cultural sector, which is currently lacking. This will benefit the cultural sector as it can better make the case for financial support from public funds; and this will benefit government and citizens, as government can be confident that policy decisions and financial investments are based on solid ex ante, ex nunc, and ex post evidence.

As stated above, stakeholder engagement with the research process lies at the heart of this project, and is essential in making the report's recommendations credible. Dissemination of project results is also vital, and the previous placement Fellow for Phase 1 of this research has advised that funds for dissemination (especially for hard copies of the project report) are crucial. Flyers describing the evaluation toolkit can be distributed, providing links to an online version of the final report.

Other potential ideas for dissemination after the placement Fellowship has ended include a high profile report launch, and constructing an online evaluation toolkit for the sector (and evaluators within government) to use.

Other likely beneficiaries of this research are other cultural sector funding agencies, who are also struggling with how best to make the case for more funding, and how best to evaluate the impact of their own investments. Also, the toolkit may be of use for evaluating other areas of public policy, particularly with regard to social and cultural benefits that are felt to be 'intangible'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49914</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Value Added Stats: Measuring the Value of Culture</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B8AC6248-5BE9-4688-B4B0-D2508B2777FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Panel session at the Association of British Orchestras Annual Conference, Liverpool, 20 January 2012.

1. That DCMS adopt a holistic approach to valuing our culture, recognising a combination of economic and non-economic approaches are valid, depending on context.

- What constitutes appropriate context is proportionality: the cost and effort required to supply economic or non-economic measures or assessments of the value of culture should be relative to the size of the enterprise or the funds requested. While it is appropriate to use economic valuation techniques for large-scale investments, these are too complex, time-consuming, and expensive, for smaller-scale investments where non-economic techniques are more appropriate.

- There is more to a holistic approach than selecting various techniques from a list of possible economic and non-economic measures. It is essential to synthesise this information within an overarching evaluation framework, such as multi-criteria analysis.

- Approaches to valuation should represent the uniqueness and quality of the offer that cultural goods and services provide.



2. DCMS should develop clear and detailed guidance on the use of economic and non-economic valuation techniques:

- There is a need to extend the evidence base for both economic and non-economic approaches to valuing culture, and to indicate which techniques are appropriate, accessible, and affordable, for smaller-scale cultural sector enterprises.

- In order to fully articulate the value of culture, a full range of tools is in need of further development, ranging from economic valuation techniques to narrative approaches. The Arts and Humanities Research Council's recently launched &amp;pound;2 million Cultural Value Project is a golden opportunity for new research to explore non-economic approaches to assessing the value of culture, to raise awareness of data that already exists and that may be readily accessed, and to ultimately provide guidance to the cultural sector on the use of non-economic valuation techniques.

- The need exists for a suitably sized pool of economic valuation studies that cover the diversity of the cultural sector, and which should be publicly available. In such a context, the use of benefits transfer equations might be explored to reduce costs of future economic valuations. To achieve this, DCMS should use in-house expertise or commission a series of economic valuation studies. However, it must be noted that original economic valuation studies will always be needed for unique cultural goods, large investments, and important policy decisions.

- There is a need for a similar bank of publicly-accessible non-economic valuation studies.

- A DCMS online resource could helpfully provide a step-by-step guide to the cultural sector on what kinds of evidence to use in making a case for funding, and in what context. Such an resource might helpfully include links to worked examples, generic templates (e.g. visitor questionnaires) and technical guidance on the application of various techniques.

- Shared guidance and templates could be used to encourage uniformity in data collection across the cultural sector, and so, where appropriate, allow decision-makers to compare like with like.



3. DCMS should continue to develop a consultative approach. The project found that the cultural sector has a wealth of experience in devising and applying economic and non-economic valuation techniques, and it is willing to engage in a constructive dialogue with DCMS about a holistic approach to valuing our culture.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To inform government policy on assessing cultural value, and to guide cultural sector assessments of cultural value.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D03CEEDF-6D17-4F62-B8A4-A77C812E7315</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5992974756.27900677810738</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://blogs.culture.gov.uk/main/priceless_a_blog_on_the_very_idea_of_measuring_cultural_value/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J008265/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
