Kingdom</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L003325/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This in an interdisciplinary programme examining the&amp;nbsp; options for Scottish constitutional change, including independence, and their implications for the future of the UK and Scotland. It will provide evidence to help inform voter understanding of the key issues ahead of the&amp;nbsp; referendum to September 2014, and of the significance and consequences of the referendum result. In the longer term, it will develop a research centre involving academics from political science, economics and law to strengthen the capacity for the generation of new knowledge on the social, economic and political challenges associated with constitutional change.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are two broad themes:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the rescaling of social and politial systems at multiple levels&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>union, or ways of re-integrating policy at new levels.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Research on citizen and elite behaviour cuts across each of these themes. The projects all address consequences of rescaling, that is, the migration of economic, social and political systems to new levels, which are connected in complex ways. The research employs legal analysis, political and policy analysis, economic modeling and behavioural analysis to explore the implications of different constitutional options. Whatever the outcome of the referendum, Scotland?s constitutional future will develop within a series of overarching ?unions? within the British Isles, the European Union and beyond. These will place some constraints on what a Scottish - and UK - government could do under all constitutional scenarios.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research centre will provide informed, impartial analysis on the future of the UK and Scotland both before and after the referendum on Scottish independence. It has identified three main sets of beneficiaries: (i) Civil society, including the voluntary sector, the business community, trade unions and public sector professionals; (ii) civil servants, political campaigners, parliamentarians, and their staff, including: civil servants in the Scottish Government, Whitehall, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the European Commission; parliamentarians and parliamentary staff; and senior officials within local authorities; and (iii) the wider public in Scotland and beyond, who are eager to be informed on the consequences of the referendum outcome and of what may follow it.

We will engage in a wide range of activities to ensure our research reaches these audiences. Proposed activities include five seminars intended to bring together senior representatives of civil society organisations, government and parliaments. Each seminar will be by invitation only, and will involve 20-30 participants and be conducted under Chatham House rules to encourage frank, open and honest exchange. The five seminars will be on the following project themes: external relationships; economic futures; fiscal pacts; constitutionalism and democracy; and inequality in Scotland. In addition to these seminars, we will offer tailored private briefing sessions to representatives of the Scottish Government, Whitehall and other governments from the UK and beyond, on key issues relevant to the future of the UK and Scotland. We will guard fiercely our impartiality in all of these activities, which will be focused on enhancing the impact of evidence-based academic research. 

We will reach broader audiences through several means. First, we will produce a comprehensive set of easy-to-read reports (3 per project - 27 in total), which we will disseminate widely among user groups and via the traditional media, social media and our website. Second, we will convene a large public conference in the aftermath of the referendum, to analyse the result and its implications for the future of both Scotland and the UK. We will also feed research from out projects into other public-facing events already planned under existing projects, including those supported by the ESRC Future of the UK and Scotland programme. Third, the project team will exploit opportunities to disseminate findings via the media, drawing on our extensive collective experience, contacts and reputations nationally and internationally. As well as responding to frequent requests for interview, we will actively seek opportunities to participate in relevant scheduled programmes by providing tailored 1 page briefing papers for circulation around broadcasters, and writing 'op ed' articles for broadsheet newspapers. Fourth, we will develop a research centre website, embedded within the 'Scottish Independence' section of the website of the University of Edinburgh's Academy of Government. This already includes a Referendum Blog which offers informed analysis of issues related to the referendum, as well as a portal to advertise relevant academic-led events. We will use the blog to disseminate project findings to a wider academic and non-academic community online. The blog is already set up so that posts are disseminated through Twitter and Facebook. These will be augmented by individual Twitter feed from selected members of the research team, contributing academic research to what is already a lively online constitutional debate in Scotland.
 
A six person advisory board will be established as soon as the projects are underway, to guide us towards ensuring that opportunities to inform and influence all beneficiaries are fully exploited.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2437955</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department for Work and Pensions</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Stakeholder meeting with DWP officials</gtr:description><gtr:id>936A6C74-86A0-4EEA-9D25-02133A7AC0F4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d9279ab9d927b8-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Stakeholder engagement: Nicola McEwen convened a second meeting with officials from the UK Department of Work and Pensions, to discuss the further development of the Scotland Analysis paper on UK social security and independence.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Chambers of Commerce</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Scottish Independence - Collaboration with Scottish Chambers of Commerce</gtr:description><gtr:id>62BDD55F-A54F-4F2B-B339-8703DA40996F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration has resulted in the collection of a new survey on business attitudes to constitutional change.

In particular, the workshop sessions focused on issues of accession to and terms of membership in the EU; strategies of small states as well as regions within states to influence decision-making in the EU; and Scotland's membership in international alliances and its options for defence policy.

The event raised awareness of the ESRC Future of the UK and Scotland programme and contributed to our knowledge of positions of officials in EU institutions regarding the debate on Scottish independence.

If one accepts the idea of a bargain between two sovereign entities, Scotland may be able to initiate further devolution of powers ending up in a looser union with England.

The Workshop engaged in plenary discussion of these papers and of the draft Scottish Independence Referendum Bill and the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill. A wide range of participants took part, including civil servants from the Scottish Government, the United Kingdom Government, the Scottish Parliament, representatives of the two main campaign organisations (Yes Scotland and Better Together), a number of academics from law and political science, and representatives from civil society.

It resulted in : Report of ESRC Funded Workshop, Edinburgh Centre for Constitutional Law, 5 April 2013

This is the report of proceedings of a one day workshop organised by the Edinburgh Centre for Constitutional Law at Edinburgh Law School on 5 April 2013. It is part of a research project undertaken by Professor Stephen Tierney titled: 'The Scottish Independence Referendum: A Democratic Audit'. As part of this project Professor Tierney is tracking the legislative process leading to a statute-based regulatory regime for the referendum scheduled for 2014. The Workshop marks the beginning of this work. The project is funded by the ESRC's major investment in Senior Research Fellowships to study: 'the broad range of issues and policy areas affected by the Scotland independence debate and the longer term future of the UK and Scotland.' In the course of the Workshop five presentations were offered by experts in United Kingdom referendum law and practice. The event was conducted under the Chatham House rule; in the Report neither the identity nor the affiliation of any speaker, nor that of any other participant, is revealed.

The Workshop marks the beginning of work on 'The Scottish Independence Referendum: A Democratic Audit'. It helped inform the two bills.

I was appointed as adviser to the Scottish Parliament Bill committee in 2013. I was able to use my research and the outcomes of this Workshop to inform the Committee.

Its main aim was to assess how the draft legislation governing the referendum and whether it would ensure a fair, lawful and democratic referendum.

In conjunction with our previous work on inequality, the impacts included the stimulation of public debate. We met with Gordon Brown who cited the work extensively in his book 'My Scotland, our Britain'. We presented the work at the Liberal Democrats Spring Conference 2014. We received requests for further information from groups including Taxpayers Alliance and Scottish Green Party. We were invited to give evidence at the Scottish Parliament Economy Committee 23 April 2014. The research was cited by Jackie Ballie MSP in a parliamentary question to Alex Salmond in First Minister's Questions, 23 Jan 2014.

The results of the research have been cited in policy briefings by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. One example: http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/S4_EconomyEnergyandTourismCommittee/Meeting%20Papers/Papers_20140219.pdf

The event was one of many public engagement activities prior to the Scottish referendum on independence.

Though defeated, the house was able to register its dissatisfaction with the handling of the fiscal framework, a key element of the devolution of public finances that was not included in the bill itself.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d834fad68e28.93347903</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldselect/ldeconaf/55/55.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dialogue session on the independence debate and renewable energy</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F60A4BB0-9086-41BC-9C1A-C39545D95F8A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This seminar was convened by the Edinburgh Academy of Government to engage policy leaders from government, business, public and third sector to discuss the constitutional debate and the politics of renewable energy.

The first workshop, which took place on 13 November, focused on the constitutional implications of a yes vote; this second workshop will discuss what constitutional changes might nevertheless be desirable in the event of a no vote.

If the vote were to be against independence, it does not follow that there would be no further change in Scotland's constitutional position within the UK. The political effect of a no vote might be to discourage any further adjustment to the constitution. On the other hand, since the independence option would effectively have been ruled out for a number of years, there might be more focus on the adequacy of the current devolution settlement. We should also remember that the Scotland Act 2012 provided for significant changes to the financing of devolution including a Scottish rate of income tax and changes to the block grant, but these changes have not yet taken effect.

This workshop will, therefore, explore some of the key issues that will arise if Scotland stays in the union including: implementing the new financial regime under the Scotland Act 2012; the future of public services in Scotland; what should be the process for any further constitutional reform in the UK; devolution and reform of the House of Commons; inter-governmental relations within the UK and; Scotland-EU relations.

The workshop focused on the constitutional implications of a yes vote; the second, held at the University of Glasgow on 26 November 2013, discussed what constitutional changes might nevertheless be desirable in the event of a no vote. 

The widely shared assumption - endorsed by the Scottish Government - is that an independent Scotland would join the overwhelming majority of nations in adopting a written constitution. In this workshop we will explore a range of issues raised by the prospect of a written Scottish constitution, including: the process for adopting a constitution and interim constitutional arrangements; the content of a written constitution, covering both substantive values and institutional questions; and the legal status of a written constitution, exploring models of entrenchment, interpretation and amendment, as well as the relationship of the constitution to other regional and global legal orders.

The Scottish Government was expected to argue that a currency union, even if it is an informal union ('sterlingization'), is possible and the path to follow. In the author's view, because of the level of debt an independent Scotland would inherit, this arrangement is likely to be unstable. An alternative coherent option is for an independent Scotland to introduce its own currency.

'Beyond the Referendum: a Supreme Court for Scotland' considered the future of the Supreme Court tier in the event of either a 'Yes' or a 'No' vote in the forthcoming Independence Referendum. 

This seminar featured contributions from Professor Neil Walker (Edinburgh Law School), Professor Aileen McHarg (Strathclyde Law School), Anna Poole QC (Faculty of Advocates), and Christine O'Neill (Chairman of Brodies LLP). In Part One of the evening, there was consideration of the jurisdiction of a Scottish Supreme Court both in the 'interim constitution', and in the aftermath of a constitutional convention, in the event of a YES vote. Part Two looked at how the jurisdiction of the UK Supreme Court might evolve, taking into account the Scotland Act 2012, and how that court's jurisprudence might continue to develop Scots law, in the event of a NO vote. 


It stimulated thinking and informed Tierney's research on what independence would mean, informing his publications in this area.
It also informed lawyers, judges and others in thinking about the judicial systems of the UK in light of possible constitutional change.
It also advanced collaboration with The Scottish Public Law Group and the Edinburgh Centre for Constitutional Law of which Tierney is a coordinator and director respectively.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54643f2ceaa2d1.66841376</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://splg.co.uk/beyond-the-referendum-a-supreme-court-for-scotland/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corporation - Michael Keating, 2-1-14</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BD072B86-10BE-4F2C-8C21-5FA73B559575</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interviews with international news agency as part of global reporting on independence referendum</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bb6c2a201485.27035920</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'SNP must set out their welfare vision'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6EF28C61-B955-4DD3-AD9F-A72D850977F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Op ed in The Scotsman.

As the Nordic States are often referred to as role models by the Scottish Government, the author takes a closer look at Finland and the country's record of achieving gender equality. Despite its achievements in gender equality, Finland still has problems overcoming its gender-blindness when it comes to trade union involvement in negotiating terms and conditions. He concludes that the Scottish Government is advocating the same gender-blind approach to collective bargaining and, despite its assertions of being a Government committed to greater levels of gender equality, has fallen short in this regard.

On 18 September 2014 a referendum on 'independence' will be held in Scotland and in March and April of this year two bills, the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill and the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill, were respectively introduced to the Scottish Parliament setting out the procedural details of the referendum. 

This will be the first time a referendum has been organised within the UK by a devolved government, and the subject of the proposed vote could not be of greater significance. Such an unprecedented (in British terms) process has led people to look abroad for comparable experiences. The most pertinent case study is clearly that of Quebec where the provincial government held referendums on 'sovereignty' in 1980 and 1995.

This Workshop will reflect upon the Quebec/Canada experience and the lessons this might hold for the Scottish process. At the same time the evolving picture within Scotland offers its own insights to those from other countries interested in how constitutional referendums can be organised at sub-state level within a plurinational state. The Workshop will also turn to other international experiences to build a broader comparative picture of the challenges facing Scotland and the broader UK as we prepare for a referendum which challenges the very existence of the state.

The Workshop will bring together political scientists, political theorists and constitutional lawyers from Quebec with specific expertise in nationalism studies, electoral studies, and the referendum process. It will also involve scholars from Edinburgh working in these areas and in constitutional law and theory. Finally, other international participants with detailed knowledge of referendum use in other plurinational states will offer insights from other comparable cases. 

Focus
The conference will focus principally upon the referendum as a constitutional process rather than substantive issues of sovereignty and independence, although these may also be discussed. Its main points of focus are:
? issues of democratic legitimacy and fairness in the referendum process 
? the legal and constitutional issues surrounding the holding of the referendum 
? deliberative democracy and the engagement of citizens
? research questions surrounding voting attitudes and behaviour 
? the implications of referendum democracy for other plurinational and divided societies 

Research Themes
The following key themes will be addressed:

Designing a Fair and Democratic Referendum Process: the key elements
 Setting the Question
 Timing
 Thresholds - simple majority/'clear majority'
 Ballot design and administration
 Independent oversight - the role of electoral commissions etc.

The legal and constitutional issues
 The trigger power
Inter-governmental relations in authorising the referendum and controlling the process
 Designing and administering the referendum 
 The constitutional implications of the referendum vote
 Judicial oversight

Deliberative democracy and citizen engagement
 Franchise rules
How might citizen engagement with the referendum process and campaign be enhanced?
 The provision of information to citizens, campaign literature etc.
 Funding and spending rules
 Media regulation and responsibility

Voter attitudes and behaviour
Voting behaviour and sovereignty issues
Levels of comprehension and confusion among voters 
Losers' consent

The Referendum Challenge in other plurinational states and divided societies
 The proliferation of the referendum 
 Experiences from former SFRY; Northern Ireland; Spain etc.

Format
Rather than a traditional 'paper-giving' format speakers have been asked to offer short (max 10 minute) interventions on a theme. The principal aim of the Workshop is to generate broad discussion, engaging as many participants as possible.

They also discussed how an independent Scotland could establish its own Defence forces and Intelligence agency.

The purpose and impact of this event was information sharing and knowledge exchange. During the run-up to the referendum, uncertainty about consequences for the defence sector was high and practitioners were looking for information about opportunities and risks.

In addition, fellows have also worked with civil servants to inform the thinking of government. Extensive engagement activity has also helped inform and frame public debate around the issue of constitutional change. 
In terms of parliamentary engagement, the Centre on Constitutional Change has worked particularly closely with the House of Lords Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (Westminster), the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, the Scottish Parliament's Welfare Reform Committee and, especially, the Devolution (Further Powers) Committee and the European and External Relations Committee - both at Holyrood. 
In terms of working with government, we have provided advice to the Cabinet Office, Treasury, Scotland Office and Scottish Government both through formal meetings and workshops and less formal means such as newsletters and blogs, which we know to be widely read by civil servants.
We have made a particular effort to inform the public and encourage popular understanding of the UK's changing constitutional relationships. This has involved significant outreach through both digital and traditional media. The focus of the centre's digital activity has been a blog-driven website, which so far has received over 659,000 page views from 220,000 visitors. Our output in the traditional media has also been significant with fellows reaching an audience of tens of millions during the Scottish independence referendum campaign and continuing to achieve a significant presences since.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3144999C-31D0-4B60-B603-D3FD2E057679</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d59b76ec4d34.01247854</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As shown in our forthcoming book, the referendum campaign focused on both constitutional issues and substantive issues of economics, welfare, defence and security.

I attended several of these meetings in Edinburgh and London. I presented a paper on prevention policymaking to the Scottish Government in February 2014 (http://www.futureukandscotland.ac.uk/blog/%E2%80%98decisive-shift-prevention%E2%80%99) and June 2015. 
I chaired a Political Quarterly workshop in October 2014, which brought together the special issue contributors with UK and Scotland civil servants and representatives of local government and the third sector. I chaired a workshop in June, bringing together the Scottish Parliament's finance committee with civil servants and practitioners to discuss evidence based policymaking. 
I have given evidence to the Scottish Parliament, on (a) parliamentary reform and (b) public policy (http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/S4_FinanceCommittee/General%20Documents/Summary_of_submissions_Paul_Cairney.pdf), and to the Northern Ireland Assembly's inquiry on the Barnett formula. 
I have interviewed approximately 40 Scottish Government civil servants and Scottish Parliament MSPs and staff and will interview HM Treasury staff in 2015 (Emily St Denny interviewed over 50 practitioners in the third sector). I used this information to feed back regularly to both governments about their respective policy styles and progress. 

To maximise influence via an 'enlightenment' function (described by Carol Weiss), I have described my work on 'prevention' policy through the lens of the idea of 'evidence-based policymaking'.

The investigation and subsequent report were influential in affecting public debate. In particular, the debate on the Scotland Bill in the House of Lords debate which took place on 29th February 2016 included the following amendment (57ZA) by Lord Forsyth of Drumlean:

Before Clause 13, insert the following new Clause-

&amp;quot;Approval of the fiscal framework

Nothing in this Part shall have effect until each House of Parliament has passed a motion expressing its approval of the agreement between the Scottish Government and the United Kingdom Government on the Scottish Government's fiscal framework.&amp;quot;

This amendment was intended to indicate concern over the lack of debate of Scotland's proposed fiscal framework both in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords. Although the amendment failed, this debate did provide one opportunity for an informed discussion of the implications of Scotland's new fiscal framework. The text from Hansard (referenced below) makes clear David Bell's contribution to informing this debate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7ff0e04123.66717349</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldhansrd/text/160229-0002.htm</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Oral Evidence: Scottish Parliament (Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee) - David Bell, Angus Armstrong</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>40ADD0D9-A1B1-41C2-A163-50F24998397E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54648db2719894.56906573</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in SPICE publication &amp;quot;The Smith Commission's Welfare Proposals (21 January 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7F02CADB-9426-4238-B797-88FF0A66EF78</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5624c007013f03.70243935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/85958.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation of report to Devolution (Further Powers) Committee of the Scottish Parliament &amp;quot;Intergovernmental Relations &amp;amp; Parliamentary Scrutiny&amp;quot; (24 September 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9EE0B391-6B2C-4FB3-B3F1-E13100E131D9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5624bf703c8d75.38309471</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/2015.09.30_IGR_External_Research_Report_FINAL.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Quoted by UK parliamentarians during their inquiry into intergovernmnetal relations</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>80C9AB5F-0368-4EBB-BB50-89092209E413</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d43ddae05299.65002118</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/constitution/inter-gov-relations/EvidencevolumeIGR.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Meeting with the Devolution Director and senior colleagues at the Department of Work and Pensions on the draft clauses of the Scotland Bill and their relevance to welfare policy (6 January 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3203EFCC-2540-4C93-B5F2-E6F6BD109A01</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5624bdd2081fd3.50546885</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Oral Evidence: Scottish Parliament Finance Committee - Michael Keating 20-5-15</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5AD6F2F-37AE-46A9-A955-C4C13A8772AE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5593c2de124f38.86314837</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Oral evidence: Scottish Parliament Finance Committee - Katerina Lisenkova</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6409F22E-C525-4079-953C-69CF0B0D2687</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546487fd151855.13320899</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Written evidence to House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution - Michael Keating 1-9-15</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E6EDCAA6-E09B-4655-906A-4DFCF07FC377</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bb247bd0ffa2.21447345</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Gave evidence to the Scottish Parliament's Finance Committee (11 April 2014) on likely scenarios for Scottish Public Finances post-indyref</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9E1AB705-14C3-480A-A530-92135895D3E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Finance Committee was investigating the likely impact of changes in powers, including independence, would have on taxation, borrowing, public sector debt and fiscal rules.
