The history of Britain as the 'First Industrial Nation' is influential on development theory and policy worldwide. This project's database and analysis will transform understanding of entrepreneurship in Britain over 1851-1911, lessons for modern policies, and relations to modern entrepreneurship and economic growth.

Previous research yields little information on business numbers and size-distribution in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This makes economy-wide understanding of entrepreneurship and business dynamics difficult, and relation to modern patterns impossible to assess. The division of contributions between wages earners, self-employment, and businesses of different types of business over 1851-1911 are highly uncertain (as indicated by gaps in ONS and other historical series). As a result, we have very limited understanding of economy-wide evolution since the 1850s of individual and geographical patterns of entrepreneurs, managerial change, and their role in economic growth. Many widespread claims about entrepreneurship and small business development over time are basically untested. These historical gaps have current relevance to BIS, local government and international agencies that promote entrepreneurship and economic development. 

This project aims to identify the population in Britain of those entrepreneurs who were employers, company directors, and self-employed own account traders using available census records over 1851-1911. These data have not previously been used to extract businesses/entrepreneurs because they have not been available electronically. The recent creation of a database (I-CeM) for most censuses at UKDA now makes this project feasible. 

This is a 'Big Data' project involving the development and analysis of a database for each census of approximately 2-4 million self-employed individuals and 150,000-400,000 business owners/entrepreneurs that employ others. This will create the first publically available data on the population of individual business proprietors in Britain over 1851-1911, to be deposited at the UK Data Archive.

The objectives are ambitious, but feasibility has been tested through a pilot using the full 1881 e-Census records. This pilot developed the extraction algorithm required and assessed the representativeness of the employer information obtained.

The project will contribute to both current and historical debates through new findings on institutional and personal supports to entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial fertility of different geographical environments, the relation to modern entrepreneurship and growth, gendered participation rates, and the characteristics of entrepreneurs and locations that contribute most to enterprise creation and growth. It will give the first large-scale long-term estimates of entrepreneurship rates and business numbers by employee size, location, gender, sector organisational status (as Ltd. Cos., partnerships and sole traders), and types of entrepreneur. The project will estimate historical trends and drivers of entrepreneurship through multivariate econometric estimation, how the historical patterns influence modern entrepreneurship and growth, and what this means for modern policy. 

Findings will be communicated through events aimed at specific user groups, publications, web-dissemination, provision of key statistics (akin to modern BIS SME Statistics), and maps of the main distribution patterns at different spatial scales. Case studies will enrich quantitative interpretations to help engage user groups, and two pilots will investigate integration of census with company records on shareholders &amp;amp; directors, and track panels of firms/entrepreneurs over time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Greater detail in 'Pathways to Impact'.

A. Main beneficiaries:

1. Entrepreneurs and commercial sectors supporting them (e.g. venture capital, banks, IFAs, accountancy, law). 
2. Organisations supporting entrepreneurs; e.g. British Venture Capital Association, BBA, UK Business Angels, Centre for Entrepreneurs, Chambers of Commerce, Young Enterprise, Young Chambers, Princes Trust, IoD, FSB, CBI: SME Taskforce, Trade Association Forum, Prowess, Women's Business Networks, etc.
3. Research Organisations networked to entrepreneurs; e.g. Nesta, ESRC Enterprise Research Centre (Warwick-Aston etc), SBRC (Kingston), SERU (Newcastle), Cambridge Centre for Business Research, other Business Schools.
4. Government departments, policy-makers and agencies; e.g. ONS, BIS, UKTI, UKBI, Technology Strategy Board, Scottish and Welsh Executives, England's Local Enterprise Partnerships, British Library IP Centre.
5. International agencies that use GB historical experience; e.g. Wold Bank, IFC, UN etc.
6. Users of historical data; e.g. English Heritage, National Trust, etc.
7. The wider public via family history societies, Society for Genealogists (SOG), FindMyPast, etc

B. How they will benefit:

1. Entrepreneurs and organisations, international agencies, government departments and agencies that support them will gain improved knowledge and understanding of trends in entrepreneurship and its drivers. 
2. Greater understanding will increase the effectiveness of public services and policy supports to entrepreneurs and small businesses.
3. Independent researchers will benefit from ability to search for historical business information via the database deposits at UKDA and training sessions through SOG and FH societies.

C. Impacts from the project:

1. The history of the GB as the 'First Industrial Nation' is influential on development theory and practice worldwide. This project's new knowledge will improve understanding of entrepreneurship 1851-1911, and its relation to modern patterns.
2. This will feed into the advice and support entrepreneurs receive and improve entrepreneurial policy to enhance national economic performance and competitiveness.
3. Better understanding of the historical drivers of entrepreneurship will contribute to improved evidence-based policy-making at local, national and international levels.
4. This will enhance effectiveness and improve professional practice of commercial sectors, support organisations, and public agencies supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses.

D. Timescales for impacts:

Great efforts will be made to disseminate the work from this project as quickly as possible. 
1. First-round timescales (years 1-2). Early dissemination of main tabular results will engage other researchers and publicise main findings.
2. Second-round (years 2-3). Seminars, website development, working papers, and published outputs from the research.
3. Medium and Long term (Years 3-). Deposit of the database at UKDA, publications and maintenance of websites of research results at Campop and UKDA, and promotion by the PI, Co-Is, and partners will ensure continued accessibility of data and research materials into the future.

E. Contribution to professional skills:

1. Given the position of Cambridge and other partner HEIs substantial numbers of people are attracted to work as PhDs, Post-docs and visitors who will draw from this project during its life and after.
2. The staff working on the project will develop widely-used skills in academic research, professional practice of commercial sectors, and public service agencies. The skills are generic to database analysis in many fields and will help staff find employment in a wide range of sectors.
3. Family history researchers will benefit from training lectures at SOG and local FH societies.

A working paper on this will be completed within a few months and made available via the web. The classification produced for each parish and RSD within the I-CeM census data will be used by other projects at Campop and elsewhere.

As an internationally recognised centre for research on the UK census, social and economic structures and demography, Campop was used as the ideal base for R. Bennett (PI) to convene a workshop on specific aspects of the ESRC entrepreneurship project to facilitate design and feedback, and to align with other researchers in the field. The workshop had three sessions over 5 hours with continuing detailed exchanges after the event to define the details of follow up work. The ESRC project on entrepreneurship formed the core element and was presented by Robert Bennett with PDRA Harry Smith and PDRA Dragana Radicic. This focused on the results of statistical analysis of the 1891 census data base to classify the core spatial units being used (Registration Sub-Districts - RSDs) using Factor Analysis, focusing on the needs for identifying different 'environments on entrepreneurship' (one of the key outcomes required from the ESRC project). The outcomes and stage of the analyses of the ESRC project were interrogated by the participants; potential minor changes in methods and interpretation were discussed; and further work will benefit form this scrutiny and exchange. Additionally the workshop was designed to develop a partnership, working with Prof. Murat G&amp;uuml;ven&amp;ccedil;, of Istanbul. This is recorded elsewhere as it develops.
The workshop also had a presentation on classifying RSDs focusing on the specific needs of another ESRC project (on fertility) using the same UK census records and for the same year (1891) from Dr. Alice Reid (Cambridge University); this allowed comparison using a different classification tool and for different purposes. This fed important information into Reid's fertility project [especially for follow up for one the key sectors/spatial codes identified in the analysis from the entrepreneurship project (apparel manufacture)], and also provided useful ideas for the entrepreneurship project.
The third element of the workshop was led by Prof Murat H. Murat G&amp;uuml;ven&amp;ccedil; (Department of Political Science and Public Administration, Faculty of Economics, Administrative and Social Sciences &amp;amp; Director Istanbul Studies Center, Kadir Has University) and his colleague Dr Berkay K&amp;uuml;&amp;ccedil;&amp;uuml;kbaslar. These two researchers have been developing a different but related project and methodology early censuses (1831 and earlier) with Dr Leigh Shaw-Taylor, who is a Co-I with PI Bennett on the ESRC entrepreneurship project. This Turkish Centre, directed by G&amp;uuml;ven&amp;ccedil;, is an internationally leading institution for research on historical research, with similar focuses to that of Campop. Shaw-Taylor used part of his Co-I resource for the ESRC project to bring G&amp;uuml;ven&amp;ccedil; and K&amp;uuml;&amp;ccedil;&amp;uuml;kbaslar to Cambridge to explore the development of a partnership on classification research for the later censuses (1851-1911) that are the core of the ESRC entrepreneurship project.

Bennett) who continues to convene and chair the group. It meets at Cambridge and aims: (1) to exchange experiences of working with the I-CeM database, which is a core resources for the ESRC project; (2) to identify deficiencies in the data and work towards methods of improvement; (3) to share activities with other researchers that are intended to plug gaps or institute improvements in I-CeM; (4) develop a strategic view of priorities for I-CeM improvements; (5) disseminate improvements and inform other users. This has modified the database in use by the user community and improved everyone's knowledge of the data properties, and its limitations.
The working group has a core of membership of 18, with others added on a case by case basis when needed. It involves meetings with Cambridge, Essex and Leicester experts who are using the database. Liaison is also maintained with I-CeM users in Scotland. It met 21 times over 2015 after the data was first received by the PI in late 2014, leading up to an I-CeM version 2 which became available in January 2016. Most of the detailed work on V.2 was prepared by staff on another ESRC project 'Fertility Atlas'. It is available locally at Cambridge as:
Sch&amp;uuml;rer, K., Higgs, E., Reid, A.M., Garrett, E.M. (2016) 'Integrated Census Microdata V.2 (I-CeM.2)' [local version]. It will be deposited at UKDA.

The group met 4 times in 2016 to receive and digest the version 2 of I-CeM. In 2017 it is working on a version 3. Much activity takes place by the members between meetings. Formal notes are reported and disseminated to group members after each meeting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>586bdb92ca1107.34433893</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar presentation (Cambridge) by Bennett (PI) and Dragana Radicic (PDRA) on partnership aspects of ESRC project business data base</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E2F1D6C6-C8BB-4A4F-8336-E0F5319E4352</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to Cambridge Group for History of Population and Social Structure (Campop), attended by c. 40, with e-mailing to c. 300.

1. Core research questions:
A1: Long-term rates of entrepreneurship
Major elements are completed of estimation of the numbers of businesses and identification of entrepreneurs compared with the economically active by sector, firm size, organisational structures, type of entrepreneur, geographical location and comparison over time. Most data are complete and will be presented by the PI and PDRAs for the Business History Association (BHA) Conference in June and European Business History Association (EBHA) in September. 
A2: The drivers of entrepreneurship choices
Pilot multinomial logit and probit choice models have been estimated for probability of being an entrepreneur in 1891 (either employer or self-employed own account) compared to being an employee taking account of local environments, sectors, and individual characterises (age, gender, family status, human capital surrogates etc.). A version of analysis for 1891 will be presented at the BHA on gender and migrants. For businesses the census database is being enriched to allow comparisons with incorporated businesses (this work only partially complete). This will be one presentation at the EBHA in September. 
A3: Future developments for other research applications will be developed in the next year.

Subsidiary research questions. 
B4: The groundwork has been laid in the construction of the database to assess farm size (acres) and employment levels. 
B5: Lead sectors of changing entrepreneurship are being identified, and regional patterns classified using factor analysis. This is complete for 1891 and is being rolled out for other years. Collaboration with outside partners in Turkey is piloting an alternative methodology using multiple correspondence analysis. 
B6: Gender differentiation of entrepreneurship is being examined in pilot studies and will be presented at the Economic History Society Conference in April. 
B7: Portfolio entrepreneurs (multiple-businesses) have been extracted for all years and are fully coded except for 1851. 
B8: The proportion of working population who were (i) wage earners (ii) sole traders (iii) employers is now nearly complete for all years except 1851-71.

Pilot studies.
The planning of these has been advanced and trials have confirmed feasibility of: P9: Linked analysis of registered companies and directors. This is almost complete for 1881 and all data have been keyed for 1891, 1901 and 1911 ready for analysis: pilot to be presented at the EBHA conference. P10: Panel study (i) Trials for case study areas have been successful for 1891 and will be rolled out to other years by mid-2018; (ii) full implementation of panel tracking using algorithmic matching will begin in October as planned; (iii) tracking of target businesses by size and sector using a stratified quota random sample have begun but have been delayed (see 3.4 below).

2. Progress on outputs (see Research Fish)
1. The database for individual entrepreneurs and businesses 1851-1911 to be deposited at UKDA is well towards completion for 1881-1911, but major difficulties have been encountered for 1851-71 that have delayed development (see 3.1-3.3). 
2. Consistent statistical summary tables, spatial maps, GIS data deposited at UKDA is being advanced as the data become available. Data deposit is now planned for mid-2018, rather than early-2018 as previously expected.
3. Research papers in leading journals are being developed; delays in data development for the early years will prevent full comparisons over time until May-June 2017. Working Papers fully documenting the data and reporting research results are due for completion by April to coincide with launch of an enhanced website.
4. Participation in user events. Various links have been developed with local users through case study pilots, and with TNA.

3. Difficulties encountered
The database being used (I-CeM) was prepared by Essex University from transcribed census data from FindMyPast (FMP). Unfortunately difficulties with the original transcriptions by FMP have been found, and further difficulties of Essex data coding have been discovered. The PI established a working group with national census experts to help overcome the deficiencies (see Research Fish); this group has shared work on further coding and cleaning that has improved I-CeM to produce version 2. Other staff at Cambridge Campop have also made major inputs to version 2. This group has met 25 times to date and is now planning a version 3. In addition this project has encountered three additional difficulties:
3.1. For 1851: I-CeM has gaps for approximately 75,000 employer records needed for this project, because about 40% of England and Wales were not fully transcribed by FMP.
3.2 For 1861: I-CeM has gaps for approximately 35,000 employer records that were truncated to a maximum of 50 characters at some stage in encoding by FMP, and the full data have been lost.
3.3 For 1871: The electronic capture of this year is in process of being added to I-CeM, but has almost all occupations missing. This is the key data needed for this project.

These data deficiencies were unforeseen because they were not present in the 1881 pilot used, are not documented in I-CeM user guides. Considerable effort and costs have had to be re-directed to infilling the gaps using original keying and purchase of data from other suppliers. This has been entirely successful to fill all gaps, but has delayed completion of the database and subsequent analysis by about 6-months.

4. Conclusion

All difficulties encountered have been overcome, but the timetable has had to be revised, with some elements brought forward whilst waiting for data deficiencies etc. to be overcome.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>(1) The updating of the I-CeM database is contributing to improving a national resource and is involving a wide group of participants.

(2) The infill and development of the project's database of entrepreneurs will be deposited at UKDA to be become the base resource for research on entrepreneurship for 1851-1911. Assurances of its completeness and accuracy are essential for its use by others, and the efforts of the project team over the first year have been directed at achieving that outcome. 

(3) Pilot and preliminary analysis of the extracted data is providing early understanding of the entrepreneurship process for this period. This is being presented to practitioner conferences over 2017.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CF8FF68C-EB6E-429B-BC39-4CBEB3EC1CA7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b590db07ba39.95689003</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7D9472B-A851-4385-9A32-F5B4F2DB3B9A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Consultation by British Library on PIDs and their use in humanities and social sciences.
