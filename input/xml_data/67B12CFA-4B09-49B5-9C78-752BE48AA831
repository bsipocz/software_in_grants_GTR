Drawing on the Italian case study but also through a comparison with other European countries, the proposal addresses issues which have been under-researched, especially questions related to disengagement from, as opposed to engagement with, terrorism. The analysis focuses on the mental and psychological processes linked to de-radicalisation, as narrated by former terrorists and the ways in which they renegotiate their identity in this process. To this end the research analyses in depth the political memoirs of leaders and members of extreme-left and extreme-right terrorist groups, which operated in Italy in the 1960s and 1970s. Empirical material consists primarily of autobiographies, interviews, public debates, including roughly 50-hour recordings of televised interviews. Memoirs by former, mainly left-wing, terrorists as well as books containing original interviews with former terrorists amount to at least 50 volumes since 1990. More recently, former extreme-right terrorists have started to talk about their past involvement in terrorist violence, including bomb attacks against innocent civilians. Further interview transcripts are kept in the archives of various Italian Institutes: Casa della Memoria e della Storia, Rome; Casa della Memoria, Brescia; Istituto Cattaneo, Bologna. Surprisingly, these narratives have not been systematically examined, yet they form a unique and extremely rich source of first-hand testimony, providing invaluable insight into processes of youth de-radicalisation, social re-integration of ex-terrorists, as well as personal and collective healing and self-identity constructions. In addition, the Applicant will carry out further interviews with former terrorists, focusing on disengagement. \nThe research also addresses issues related to the social reintegration of the 'terrorist subject', exploring the nature of public/voluntary projects of reintegration and the ways in which they promote non-violent and democratic narratives and practices. The study also examines the role played by victims' associations, commemoration ceremonies, monuments and other cultural initiatives in providing a wider context of 'pacification'. As well as consulting published material, the Applicant will carry out interviews with Italian associations of the victims of terrorisms and other associations engaged in educational/cultural projects of national 'pacification'.\nFinally, the research analyses the Italian case in a broader European context, through a comparison with Northern Ireland, Spain, France and Germany. \nThe proposed research will result in completion of a jointly authored book, with Dr Philip Cooke, entitled Ending Terrorim, Italian Style, to be published by Routledge.\nTable of Contents:\nIntroduction: A brief overview of the literature on terrorism. \n1. Political memoirs and the study of terrorism: This chapter discusses the validity of studying terrorism through the memoirs of former terrorists, with reference to a variety of disciplinary approaches, from communication analysis (e.g. narrative analysis or discourse analysis) to psychology (autobiographical memory, narrative psychology) and history (how collective memory is constructed). \n2. Becoming terrorists: This chapter explores how those involved in terrorism in Italy in the 1970s narrate their path to political violence and membership of a terrorist organization.\n3. Disengagement and disassociation: Building on the preceding section, this chapter explores the circumstances in which terrorists withdraw from violence and the manner in which they narrate their experience.\n4. Negotiating personal and collective healing and identity after terrorism. This chapter investigates post-terrorist constructions of the self. 5. Italy in comparative perspective. Conclusion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Within academia, it is anticipated that the research findings will provide an original contribution to the very recent scholarly debate on issues relating to disengagement from terrorism. To this end, \ndissemination will take place through seminars, conference papers and lectures. Seminars will be organised at Bath and Strathclyde. A conference paper will be presented at the 2011 Conference of the Society of Italian Studies. Further papers will be presented to the Political Studies Association and American Historical Association in 2012. \n\nIt is anticipated that the volume resulting from the proposed research will constitute an important bibliographical reference for the many undergraduate and postgraduate courses on terrorism taught in UK universities. I personally teach a final-year course on Italian terrorism and contribute to a Master course on Global Terrorism, both of which will be informed by my findings once I return to teaching. \n\nOutside academia, dissemination to the wider public will be sought through the media. My previous research was reported in the Italian press (including the authoritative daily newspapers Il Sole24ore and Corriere della Sera) and led to some radio interviews. The proposed new volume should generate a similar high level of interest in Italy and even greater interest outside Italy, given its comparative dimension. \n\nIt is also envisaged that the book will be presented to academics, civil society representatives and the public at a series of open meetings in Italy and the UK, including at the Italian Institute of Culture, Edinburgh and London.\n\nGiven their comparative perspective, the findings will also be fed directly to civil society organisations and public sector/voluntary bodies in Italy and the UK which have promoted initiatives designed to foster non-violence and also work on the reintegration of former terrorists in post-conflict societies. The Applicant has contacts with such associations in Italy and some contacts with similar associations in Northern Ireland. \n\nThe Applicant and her Co-Author intend to explore the possibility of producing a film documentary to be used for educational purposes, aimed at both university undergraduate and secondary school students. Dr Cooke has experience of working with, and I have good contacts with, documentary makers in Italy. \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50633</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>They have been used by Italian associations of victims in public commemorative events</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2006</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>542B8EDF-0B68-4A90-BD97-9A1AB9A14F19</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d421bd40aea9.37297946</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I discovered the importance of modes of remembering for all narratives of conflict by both victims and perpetrators.
