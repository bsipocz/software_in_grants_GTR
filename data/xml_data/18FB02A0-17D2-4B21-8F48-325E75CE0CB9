Changing prison demographics and anxieties that under certain conditions prisons may become incubators for terrorist ideology, have fuelled concerns over the role and nature of religious ideology and practice in prisons. Simultaneously, the flow of information about prisoners has moved away from prison landings and into security intelligence reporting systems, obscuring possibilities for faith as a source of growth, meaning, community, and trust.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will explore how trust, risk, identity and prisoner leadership work in two contrasting maximum security prisons.The study aims to capture dynamics that encourage human flourishing, even in prison, rather than damage to character, which is an increasing risk. The methodology combines appreciative inquiry with ethnography-led measurement of key dimensions of the prison?s moral and social climate to explore where and how trust might ?work? in this contemporary setting. It will use innovative methods to study prisoner networks, hierarches and developing ideologies, to test the hypothesis that forms of identity expression take on a different character in different moral, social and trust climates.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Research undertaken to date on prison quality by the PI and Prisons Research Centre colleagues is being used in routine performance and audit measurement of all 138 prison establishments in England and Wales (as well as internationally). The conceptual framework (areas of prison life that matter most) and measurement techniques provide an extremely valuable cultural and relational reading of prison life, shown to be predictive of (for example) suicide risk, disorder and prisoners' personal development. This ongoing, developmental research has been used in policy development on prison size, comparisons of public vs private sector prisons, refining the competition process, providing advice to Governors of poor performing prisons, in understanding the work (and reviewing the pay of) of prison officers and senior managers, and in alerting the Prison Service to new risks (e.g. of radicalisation, and the effects of risk aversion). The current project would significantly enhance the conceptual and empirical reach of this survey tool, adding several important new dimensions, as well as methods, to its development. It will deepen our understanding as well as measurement of prison moral and social climates, in ways that have direct impact on the management and operation of prisons.

The impact of introducing the Social Field Generator for use in prison sociology and the identification of leadership, for example, will provide a significant methodological development in our field. The impact of drawing on theological insight more generally will, we hope, transform the field of prison sociology, both conceptually and empirically.

We aim to produce meaningful measures of 'political charge' and 'trust', for use in comparing and evaluating prisons, but also other settings (in particular where faith differences exist).

In feeding back results to the establishments, we will produce a detailed report of the prisoner and staff findings for each establishment. In order to maximise the impact on practice, we will offer a feedback presentation/seminar to senior managers and staff, in each establishment and for the High Security Estate. We are planning the following events:
A day seminar in October 2014 to be attended by representatives from prisons, faith groups, and policy-makers, to provide interim feedback and an opportunity for discussion of emerging findings
A session at the European Society of Criminology conference, in September 2014, to report emerging findings to an academic audience.
A day seminar in May 2015 to be attended by academics and senior practitioners to explore the implications of the project.
We aim to provide the following outputs:
An article in The Prison Service Journal - a practitioner-oriented journal - to describe the research project, explain its research methods and summarise its main findings.
A short summary of the results for Inside Time, the newspaper for serving prisoners.
3 articles in peer reviewed journals
A research based book-length monograph, under the title 'Prisons and the Problem of Trust'.
An executive summary of the research findings to be distributed to senior managers and decision-makers in NOMS and beyond. 
A short, practical guide to the research implications, aimed at prison staff and middle-managers
We would also:
Work with the NOMS to introduce a revised MQPL survey and discuss its use.
Respond to requests both domestically and internationally in relation to our research tools and results.
This programme of knowledge transfer and engagement would clearly meet the ESRC's aims of supporting high-quality, transformational research, meeting the needs of end-users, and contributing to public policy and practice. We are confident that it will have practical impact for prison staff and prisoners, will reshape academic understanding of contemporary punishment and the effects and operations of imprisonment, and will influence key decision-makers and managers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196553</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Confereces and research seminars in prisons and with high security estate</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4153D84-352D-4DCD-8DD8-0AE8D584DF21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several conferences about the research findings, some organised by prisoners in 2 of the main research sites. 50 attendees at each.

In England and Wales, our findings have been used to inform a newly launched 'rehabilitative strategy' in the high security estate and in the Prison Service more generally. We are contributing to/commenting on a series of training materials/policy chapters for use in creating a 'rehabilitative culture' in the high security estate. A new categorisation review process for risk assessing prisoners on Category A, informed by our work, was in the second stage of being piloted at the time of writing. This revised procedure has led to greater emphasis on long-term prisoners' progress and accomplishments outside the framework of narrowly conceived/insufficiently available offending behaviour courses. This highly visible transformation in practice has 'unblocked' a number of stagnating prisoners, leading to enhanced perceptions of legitimacy and greater engagement by others in those aspects of the system that help to reduce their risk. We have presented and discussed our findings at several high level seminars, including a NOMS Leaders Seminar on December 17 2014 ('Risk, Trust, Faith Identities and Personhood in High Security Prisons') and the Governing Governors Forum on 15 May 2015 ('Governing Good Enough prisons'). We are spending a day with 48 members of the Metropolitan Police on 1 June 2015, presenting our findings and discussing the implications of our results. Governors of the three prisons in our study (among others) have engaged with us enthusiastically throughout, and have observed that 'the I-It, I-Thou distinction' has 'nailed it' for them (that is, has described and explained their world authentically, and has opened up new ways of seeing and working with this complex population).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8F9B47A9-7816-4E39-B20D-71BCFE147714</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546370007b8028.96303257</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research has been methodologically and conceptually transformative. Using a combination of person-centred social science, appreciative inquiry and ethnography-led measurement, we have been able to describe fundamental differences in the moral climates of apparently similar high security prisons, which lead to significantly different levels of anger and alienation ('political charge') and which shape, or make possible, what types of faith are expressed by prisoners in each environment. Both our methodology and our innovative way of reconceptualizing 'the problem' (which we have described as a problem of risk, recognition and the 'moral self') as a problem of trust, have opened the way for closer and more meaningful dialogue with participants, as well as more accurate measurement. 

We have been able to describe and capture empirically, differences between 'disabling' environments that damage well-being and character, and 'enabling' environments that support human growth or flourishing, and the reduction of risk. 

One of the innovations in this study has been to include expertise in religious studies, and in hip-hop and cultural studies in the team. Religion and music have been largely absent from sociological studies of prisoner social life, yet both play an increasingly important role in the lives of long-term prisoners. Another has been to organise ongoing Dialogue and RAP groups for prisoners, facilitated by the research team, in order to meet research participants 

The findings have significant political relevance. What we have found in high security prisons could not be more relevant to British society.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have captured the interest of scholars of trust, legitimacy and faith, and will significantly shape research agendas in these areas, in criminal justice and in relation to broader social practices. The PI has been invited to participate in a two day event led by Lord Rowan Williams, in Dialogue with the Dalai Lama ('Growing Wisdom, Changing People') at the University of Cambridge, on the theme of Universal Responsibility, as a result of the findings of this study. Keynote presentations have been given at the Universities of Birmingham and Brussels, and invitations accepted at the Universities of Oxford, Griffith (Queensland, Australia) and at the International Corrections Professionals Association Conference in Melbourne, 2015. Senior and operational practitioners are engaged with us in active discussions of the new empirical-conceptual dimensions of 'intelligent trust' and 'political charge' and using data on differences between prisons (and wings) to a) disentangle personal growth and religious coping from the risks of radicalization; and b) better understand their establishments, and so to improve outcomes. Practitioners are already considering the introduction of risk assessment and management strategies that incorporate 'whole person' and complex changes to/developments in religious and ideological trajectories. Legal officers at the European Commission (and elsewhere) have asked us to be involved in their deliberations on policies addressing the risks of extremism.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D086E19B-45C0-48D5-B22B-A553546DFB68</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54636d230f4930.07971978</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
