Patients are very unwell and often require mechanical ventilation in intensive care units. There are no particularly effective treatments of ARDS which is fatal in 30 to 40% of patients. It is not fully understood how ARDS develops though it may be related to the loss or malfunction of the normal lung protective mechanisms.
Surfactant is a compound which normally acts as a lubricant within the lungs, though it also helps to protect the lungs against injury and infection. Patients with ARDS have been shown to have a deficiency in surfactant. Furthermore, abnormal surfactant production, often due to gene mutations, has been associated with lung injury in infants and adults. We therefore believe that the absence or mutation of ABCA3, a new gene recently associated with surfactant synthesis, will make the lungs more vulnerable to injury and therefore ARDS. We aim to demonstrate this with scientific models, in which the ABCA3 gene is manipulated, and by identifying ABCA3 mutations in patients with ARDS. Such studies could generate potential future treatment options.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents acute lung injury secondary to a range of triggers that may or may not originate in the lungs, including sepsis, trauma and acute pancreatitis. Despite modern interventions mortality from ARDS remains between 30 and 40%. New therapeutic approaches are therefore needed, and have prompted intense research into processes central to lung injury and repair.
Pulmonary surfactant, composed of surfactant lipids and proteins, plays a critical role in (1) reduction of surface tension in the alveolus, (2) maintenance of pulmonary homeostasis during injury, and (3) provision of innate defence against various pathogens. Surfactant deficiency is associated with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in infants and ARDS in adults, while mutations in surfactant genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A3 (Abca3), are associated with acute RDS and chronic lung fibrosis. We therefore hypothesise that deficiencies in the surfactant system play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury.
ABCA3 is a lamellar body membrane-associated protein expressed selectively by type II epithelial cells in the alveolus of the lung. Clinical studies suggest that ABCA3 is required for lamellar body formation, surfactant lipid secretion and clearance. Mechanisms by which ABCA3 mutations disrupt type II cell function and surfactant homeostasis and its dysreguation are associated with severe lung disease in children although unstudied in adults. The present study seeks to identify the role of ABCA3 in type II cell homeostasis, lung injury and repair in mice and humans. To achieve this we shall (1) create transgenic mice in which Abca3 is conditionally deleted or mutated in type II alveolar epithelial cells, allowing detailed analysis of the effects of ABCA3 deficiency on pulmonary homeostasis; (2) establish the responses of these transgenic mice to acute external lung injury, in the form of intratracheal adenovirus or bleomycin; (3) ascertain the effect of lung injury on ABCA3 expression in wild-type mice; and (4) elucidate the potential role of ABCA3 dysfunction in acute lung injury in humans by studying the association between defined Abca3 mutations and acute lung injury in the intensive care unit.
These studies will lead to further understanding of the surfactant system, and of ABCA3 in particular, in lung injury. They are also likely to suggest novel therapeutic strategies for ARDS and other diseases characterised by aberrant surfactant production.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>774751</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Mouse model expressing a surfant protein-C mutation (L188Q), associated with familial interstitial lung disease.</gtr:description><gtr:id>54FC6124-1709-43A0-910F-4825BF44E169</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Phenotyping in progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>RnEVN1vEq6e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>SP-C L188Q Knock in mouse</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Mouse model expressing the most common surfactant protein-C mutation (I73T), associated with familial interstitial lung disease.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA02A033-28FA-4E7E-9BAA-A6E05ABA8081</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Phenotyping in progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>hKnpBUkheQv</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>SP-C I73T Knock in mouse</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This transgenic mouse facilitates tamoxifen inducible Atg7 flox (deletion) in all mouse tissues.
