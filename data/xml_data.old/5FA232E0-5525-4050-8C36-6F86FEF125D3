Our ethos is to provide an environment which is unique to children and they can call their own. We entertain and educate by encouraging children to listen, use their imagination and develop interaction skills, as well as help make them more aware of their wider environment.

We know children love space - from fascination with stars and planets to wondering whether there might be alien life out there. Over the last 5 years, we have created a number of audio series to help introduce children to space with a focus on both broad space topics (i.e. exploration and technology used) and specific missions (e.g. Pioneer, Skylab and ISS). Entitled 'Deep Space High', our series are based in an interplanetary school and are presented by fictional character, Principal Pulsar. They are informal in style and provide children with key facts and opportunities to explore further. These series were broadcast on Fun Kids and remain available to listen again on the Fun Kids website and app, and free download on iTunes. We also created a dedicated micro-site on the Fun Kids website (http://www.funkidslive.com/space/) where children are able to find additional information and images.

'Deep Space High: Intergalactic Weather Watch' will introduce children aged 10+ to a major area of space, solar and planetary science not currently covered - space weather. The series will explore weather on other planets and the impact of space weather on our own planet Earth.

Space weather is of growing importance, reflected in the Government adding solar storms to the National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies and establishing the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre to help protect the UK from the serious threats posed by space weather events. The potential for these events to cause future disruption to everyday life, including cutting electricity supplies and communications systems, necessitates that they be understood by today's children.

Our project has three key elements:
1. Create a ten-part series of short audio programmes
2. Create a supplementary, animated video series
3. Provide a team of early-career scientists with opportunities to engage with a young audience and help deliver the project

The premise of our project is developed from a recent online survey of 217 parents with primary school children. When asked how interested children would be in accessing a series introducing them to new areas of space and planetary science, 55% of respondents were very interested and 37% interested. The increasing number of space related magazines and television programmes is testament to this interest. Often, though, these are more adult in their focus, with information that goes over a child's head. We therefore also asked about alternative methods of engagement. Aside from 'audio programmes', our research showed the next highest level of interest in 'video content', reflecting the increasing time spent by children on video sharing platforms, such as YouTube. The continued growth of Fun Kids' own YouTube channels supports this.

Our project's impact will be to broaden the knowledge of children (and their families) about space weather: namely what it is, what different types there are, and the threat these pose to life on Earth. Children will have the opportunity to ask questions they might have about the topic, either through direct contact with their schools or voice messages recorded through the Fun Kids app, and have these answered by our experts. We will give children confidence to explore the science further and discuss their findings with friends, relatives and classmates. As space weather issues gain greater public awareness over the coming years, children accessing the project will be better placed to understand these developments. 

The project will inspire children to consider space related careers and motivate them to study sciences at GCSE and beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Fun Kids has a large, existing audience to whom we will promote this series on air and online. Fun Kids is available across the UK on DAB digital radio, online at funkidslive.com, and through the Fun Kids app, YouTube and iTunes channels.

Each month, over 600,000 children and 150,000 parents listen to Fun Kids (source: TGI). We average more than 500,000 hits to the Fun Kids website, 100,000 downloads of speech features through iTunes, and our video content has had over 3,500,000 views on YouTube to date. Through these various elements, Fun Kids is in a very strong position to share the project's deliverables to the widest possible audience of children (and their families).

Raising awareness

By its nature, this project will be a very public one. Both the audio programmes and animated video episodes will also be hosted on the Fun Kids website and, due to the nature of the content being produced, will also be distributed through other popular digital platforms, including iTunes and YouTube.

The project overall will be promoted through a mix of media, such as press activity, social media, and in the popular Fun Kids weekly newsletter - subscribed to by over 30,000 parents and guardians. We aim to build wider awareness of the project through our regular in-school activities and will publicise the availability of the audio programmes and videos with primary and secondary schools across the UK.

The Deep Space High series, like others within Fun Kids Learn, is already heavily utilised by primary and secondary school teachers across the country as a learning resource. We expect there to be a long tail of engagement with the deliverables, well after the project's stated completion, by pupils and educators. The Fun Kids Learn micro-site is a key resource for assisting with school homework and in-class activities, and is accessed by more than 100,000 children each month (source: Google Analytics).

All created content will also be available to STFC, partner organisers and relevant third parties as a wider educational resource. 

Dissemination and networking

The project has already received support from a number of leading universities and independent organisations that are pioneering research into space weather phenomena and monitoring the impact that these may have on life on Earth. We are in conversation with the Met Office, National Space Centre, UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and Surrey Space Centre for these supporters to assist in circulating the deliverables from the project to their respective user bases.

In terms of Fun Kids, we will share the deliverables and our project evaluation with other broadcasters and child-focused media entities to promote these further still. Through whatever platform, the more children that have access to audio content bespoke to them, and which helps inspire and encourage them to learn, the better the outcome. We would also make our findings available to a wide audience through presentations at radio and children's media conferences, to parents at school visits, and other relevant events.

The feedback from our project will, we hope, provide information for STFC and ourselves about the extent to which one can raise awareness of science issues, particularly space-related, among young consumers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P006256/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
