This project aligns fully with the scope of the IWYP call in that what we propose is both transformational and high risk, using new technologies and approaches. 
Specifically this proposal fits with: Research Area A/B: Discovery or creation of genetic variation in wheat that boosts the fixation of carbon into biomass for subsequent transfer to grains, Research Area E: Taking advantage of discoveries coming from other species. 
We will create genetic variation in wheat using a transgenic approach to increase carbon fixation and biomass to increase grain yield. The UK and the US Midwest provide very different wheat growing environments and for this reason will provide a test of robustness of a transgenic improvement in very different climates. The proposed project will take a targeted approach to improving photosynthesis. We will exploit knowledge based on data from other species obtained from our previously funded BBSRC grants which have provided clear evidence that by manipulation of the photosynthetic process in wheat we can realise substantial increases in yield potential. In the short term (9-15 months) we will generate novel germplasm based on rational and targeted single and double gene manipulation, the impact of which will be determined in the field providing robust data for future exploitation. Medium term (15 -30 months) this project will provide additional novel lead events from plants with multigene manipulations shown to have improved photosynthesis and yield in both the greenhouse. Long term (30 months and beyond) Field trials of plants with multigene manipulations of photosynthesis will have been completed and we will be in a position to provide lead events to CYMMIT for incorporation into prebreeding programmes. Importantly we also see the data from this work being incorporated into systems modelling of photosynthesis thereby leading to rational design outputs for further improvement and increased yield. We will embrace fully the IWYP guidelines in that we will manage the project effectively, operate in a collaborative and open manner, sharing methods and data, whilst maintaining the level of confidentiality required by IWYP with regard to IP.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>695933</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have carried out additional analysis of transgenic wheat plants with higher levels of the enzyme SBPase involved in photosynthetic CO2 assimilation.
