Many protein-protein interactions are mediated by Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs): short stretches of proteins (5-15 amino acids long), of which only a few positions are critical to function. These motifs are vital for biological processes of fundamental importance, such as signalling pathways and targeting proteins to the correct part of a cell. The primary objective of this project is to integrate a number of leading computational techniques to predict novel SLiMs and, in so doing, add crucial detail to protein-protein interaction networks. This will generate a valuable resource of potential SLiMs, including defined occurrences and interactions. Given the great promise SLiM-mediated interactions hold as future therapeutic targets, this resource could be a potential gold-mine for the pharma industry and future drug design. A crucial part of any predictive bioinformatics analysis is the rediscovery of previously known results. The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) database provides a rich resource of known eukaryotic motifs and these will form the basis of annotating known SLiMs that are (re)discovered during the course of the investigation. Data generated during this project will, in turn, be fed back into the ELM resource to improve existing ELM annotation and, potentially, provide new annotated occurrences of known motifs. As well as being useful for further investigation of specific protein-protein interactions, these predictions/annotations will be of interest to the wider scientific community who are interested in understanding the fundamental principles of how proteins interact with each other. To generate the SLiM predictions, this project will put together cutting-edge tools for two distinct but related activities: (1) predicting regions of proteins involved in SLiM-mediated interactions from 3D structures of proteins; (2) identifying over-represented recurring sequence patterns from proteins that all share a common interaction partner. First, structural features will be used to identify candidate regions in specific proteins. SLiMs typically interact with larger, globular domains in their partner protein, and structural signatures of such 'domain-motif interactions' can be used to highlight possible motif regions. These regions will then be compared to other proteins known to interact with the same protein as the candidate. Currently, the most successful approaches for this explicitly use a model of convergent evolution for detection. Under this model, the common motif identified must be shared by sequences that have no other detectable sequence similarity. Previously, we developed the most successful of these tools on benchmarking data, SLiMFinder, which accounts for both the evolutionary relationships found between input proteins and the total motif space being searched to estimate the statistical significance of over-represented motifs. For this project, an extension of SLiMFinder will be used that takes advantage of the fact that the 3D methods will have identified a specific short region on one of the proteins. This extra information makes the method much more sensitive. These results will be of great interest to anyone trying to understand the molecular basis of protein-protein interactions and signalling pathways. During the course of the project, the methods used will be further developed and validated, providing useful tools for future investigations. Open source software and webserver implementations will be made available to facilitate further application. This will make these methods available to bench scientists studying specific proteins and interactions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) are functional microdomains of 5-15 amino acids that mediate numerous critical protein-protein interactions (PPI). The most successful de novo SLiM discovery methods are built on an explicit model of convergent evolution, identifying over-represented motifs in unrelated proteins that share a common interaction partner. Of these methods, SLiMFinder, which estimates the statistical significance of returned motifs, has the best performance on benchmark data. SLiM-mediated interactions fall into a class of PPI sometimes referred to as Domain-Motif Interactions (DMI), in which a globular, structured ('Domain') region binds a short linear ('Motif') region. Recently, methods have been developed to identify new DMI (as opposed to domain-domain interactions) directly from high resolution 3D structural data using structural characteristics of DMI to identify short linear peptide regions that bind a globular domain. We have developed an extension to SLiMFinder, 'Query' SLiMFinder (QSLiMFinder), which can utilise this additional information explicitly to look for a motif shared between this short 'query' peptide sequence and a set of proteins that interact with the same (domain-containing) protein as the query. This substantially reduces the search space and increases the sensitivity. By combining these methods, this project aims to identify sites on proteins that are critical for their interactions; we will mine all available 3D and PPI data (from PDB and various PPI databases) to generate a resource of predicted SLiMs, complete with proposed sites of action. In collaboration with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) database, known True Positives will be used to benchmark analyses and develop a theoretical framework in which predictions can be assessed. New discoveries and/or improved annotation arising from this benchmarking - including new occurrences of known ELMs - will in turn be added back into the ELM resource.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Commercial private beneficiaries The primary non-academic beneficiaries are likely to be the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Good drug targets need to be highly specific to reduce possible side-effects. SLiMs and DMIs provide excellent targets in this context and are targets of rational drug design. Since DMI tend to be of low affinity and transient in nature, they provide a good starting point when the goal is to modulate an interaction, rather than completely ablate it. Furthermore, interactions of this nature tend to dominate signalling pathways and networks, which are often the desired targets of interventions. The outputs of this project will enable these industries to save time and money: - As a resource of new drug targets. This project will provide a valuable resource (O2, O4) of potential targets for specific interactions. - As a provider of new tools for rational drug design. Although this project aims to apply these methods as broadly as possible, the methods (O1, O5) and tools (O4) developed will be useful for rational drug design targeting specific interactions. Due to its broad scope, outcomes of this project will have the flexibility to be applied to a wide variety of diseases. When successful, SLiM predictions (O2) and analysis tools (O4) will be made commercially available under license (although would remain free for academic use). Although companies engaged in rational drug design would be the main beneficiaries in this context, these techniques and resources would also be of potential interest to biotechnology companies that make laboratory reagents for experimentally interfering with protein interaction and signalling networks. Public sector beneficiaries NHS. Ultimately, the NHS and related health care services will benefit from improved treatment with greater specificity of action and reduced side effects. Understanding of interactions at the level proposed in this project will also help drive forward the agenda of 'personalised medicine', in which specific allelic variants can be identified within an individual and the appropriate treatment given. Agriculture. SLiM-mediated host-pathogen interactions are not limited to human disease and have been identified in important agricultural pathogens such as Foot and mouth disease virus, and bluetongue virus. As novel pathogens become more of a threat to UK agriculture through climate change, this research will help save time and money in the development of interventions. Third sector beneficiaries The University of Southampton is an active teaching university. An interdisciplinary project of this nature will expose undergraduate students to exciting new skills, particularly in the case of final year research project students who will be actively involved in ongoing work. This proposal is inherently suited for splitting up into small chunks, such as individual motifs or interactions, which are ideal for undergraduate teaching. This work will therefore help enthuse, and train, the next generation of UK scientists. Due to the intimate involvement of the PI with the Doctoral Training Centre in Complex Systems Simulation, this work has great potential for attracting postgraduate studentships to develop additional aspects of the study. Not only will this provide great training for the postgrads in questions, it will also provide excellent skills development for the PDRA, who would be involved in some of the day-to-day supervision. Public dissemination The PDRA will be encouraged to develop contributions to the annual National Science and Engineering Week, for which the University of Southampton always runs highly successful events for local families. UK Bioscience Linear motif bioinformatics is an expanding field, currently under-represented in the UK. Through its strategic use of international collaborations, this project will place the UK at the heart of motif discovery in Europe.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>282807</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College Dublin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Shields Lab bioware</gtr:description><gtr:id>3038B0D7-84EB-4C04-8E7F-B2D0179685AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main output of this collaboration is the collection of webservers at bioware.ucd.ie, in addition to a number of collaborative publications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460a9119e5780.02427324-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Scientific expertise and provision of web hosting for webservers.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Scientific expertise and development of new methods, algorithms and tools.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>During this grant, new methods were developed for the prediction of short linear motifs (SLiMs) in proteins: regions that are responsible for mediating specific protein-protein interactions. SLiM prediction is a challenge due to the short and degenerate nature of the motifs, which results in a high false positive rate. We have developed a new tool, QSLiMFinder, which increases the sensitivity and specificity of prediction by incorporating information from specific high confidence sites of interaction. During the course of the project, the need for standardised benchmarking approaches and tools was identified; we also developed SLiMBench, the first dedicated SLiM discovery benchmarking program and resource dataset. In the process of developing SLiMBench, an additional tool, SLiMMaker, was developed for improving motif definitions for searches and benchmarking. Work during the grant also contributed to the development of the SLiMPrints motif discovery tool as well as contributions to the ELM (Eukaryotic Linear Motif) database, a world leader in experimentally annotated SLiMs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The methods developed by this grant are already being used by our groups and our collaborators.
