These proteins are located in a membrane - an ordered layer of fat (lipid) - and are, unsurprisingly, known as integral membrane proteins. Very few mammalian membrane proteins have had their 3-dimesional structures determined. This has largely prevented the creation of new drugs against key target, human membrane proteins by design strategies based on the structure of the protein. To determine the structure of a protein, it is first necessary to be able to make the protein in milligram amounts. Yeasts are useful host cells for making many mammalian water-soluble proteins. In contrast, they are rather poor at synthesising mammalian membrane proteins. This is in no small part due to substantial differences in the lipid content of membranes from yeast and mammalian cells. In particular, yeast do not make cholesterol - a lipid which has been shown to affect the activity and stability of many mammalian membrane proteins (including receptors, transporters and ion channels). Here, the yeast Pichia pastoris is going to be genetically manipulated so that it can make cholesterol. This modified strain will then be tested for its ability to make mammalian membrane proteins. If successful, the cholesterol biosynthetic yeast will provide an optimised environment for making milligram quantities of many mammalian membrane proteins, and will underpin structural studies that will lead directly to structure-based drug design.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>One of the major bottlenecks in determining the structures of pharmaceutically important, mammalian membrane proteins is obtaining sufficient pure, functional protein for sustained crystallisation trials. Although yeasts are commonly used for the heterologous production of soluble recombinant proteins, their potential for making membrane proteins has yet to be fully realised. Here, a strain of yeast specifically tailored for higher eukaryotic membrane protein expression will be created by genetically manipulating Pichia pastoris so that it makes the mammalian sterol, cholesterol, instead of the fungal one, ergosterol. Based on the ever-increasing body of evidence that shows that cholesterol is essential for the activity and stability of many mammalian membrane proteins, I suggest that yeast membranes containing cholesterol will be a superior environment for mammalian membrane protein production than those with ergosterol. I expect that the presence of cholesterol in yeast membranes will stabilise the recombinant membrane protein, and will result in increased production levels of the target protein compared to wild-type. I also expect that a wider range of proteins will be able to be made in the cholesterol biosynthetic yeast as compared to wild-type. To test this hypothesis, P. pastoris will be genetically modified so that it can make cholesterol. After each genetic manipulation, the sterol content of the engineered yeasts will be determined to confirm that the sterols that accumulate are as expected. Finally, the expression and activity of a range of human membrane proteins that have a known cholesterol-dependence (including G-protein coupled receptors and transporters) will be compared between the wild-type and cholesterol biosynthetic strains. By completing this, it will be possible to assess whether or not a strain of P. pastoris that makes cholesterol is indeed a better host for mammalian membrane protein production than one that synthesises ergosterol.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-08-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-05-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102315</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6EF1550C-7B95-4977-AB46-6179DF11FE44</gtr:id><gtr:title>LOV to BLUF: flavoprotein contributions to the optogenetic toolkit.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular plant</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0d012bdd5700f56bded12b077ed6cfcc"><gtr:id>0d012bdd5700f56bded12b077ed6cfcc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Christie JM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1674-2052</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_55f94ab94ab812591</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>371C4F3D-1123-4653-949D-B09A5F68A7A7</gtr:id><gtr:title>GPCR production in a novel yeast strain that makes cholesterol-like sterols.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Methods (San Diego, Calif.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ac382c189a29731a7cfa2eb9f160ea4"><gtr:id>2ac382c189a29731a7cfa2eb9f160ea4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kitson SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1046-2023</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f94a94ab7047b4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E017061/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
