&amp;nbsp;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will have wide ranging implications for road safety. The main beneficiaries of the project will be road safety professionals, policy makers, and academic researchers, with future newly-qualified drivers the ultimate beneficiaries.

Road safety professionals will be able to use the findings to better inform the development of targeted interventions aimed at reducing the elevated crash risk of newly-qualified drivers in the UK and internationally. Results of the analysis will be disseminated to the road safety community through a series of presentations at conferences and seminars, and via a specially designed project website which will be promoted through the online road safety network (e.g., roadsafetygb.org.uk, airso.org.uk etc). The results can be integrated into pre-test interventions in order to try to reduce potential crash liability prior to the start of drivers' licensed driving career. The project aims to highlight behaviours that predict membership of higher risk driver groups, and knowledge of factors associated with increased crash liability can be used by driver training practitioners to raise awareness of problem behaviour with learner drivers. Furthermore, the research will inform local government initiatives to prepare novice drivers for risks they might face on the road, such as the Learn Safe Drive Safe programme run by Sheffield City Council. The project team have considerable connections with the road safety community, which will facilitate dissemination of findings.
There will also be considerable implications for transport policy makers. The research findings will inform road safety policy, and provide an evidence base for decisions relating to newly-qualified drivers. The use of group-based modelling will also provide novel evidence on the provision and timing of intervention strategies and driver training programmes. Dissemination will be achieved through a number of ways including a one-day seminar held at the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), with an invited audience of key individuals and organisations from the road safety community, including policy makers and researchers. The project will also provide an evidence-base with which to inform debates regarding post-test supervision/training, particularly regarding Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) systems, through exploration of the time course of risky driving behaviour and its relationship with elevated crash involvement. The results will have implications for the optimal lengths for such schemes in order to achieve reductions in traffic casualties.
 
The benefits for academic researchers will be in advancement in understanding the factors that are associated with the elevated crash risk, and the underlying behaviours related to the rapid decrease in crash liability over the first few months of licensure. There is limited theoretical work on novice driver behaviour, and the results of longitudinal analysis will contribute to the development of theoretical model to help explain the variance in behaviour among novice drivers. This will be achieved through publication of the research in high impact journals, and presentations at international conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>145183</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Transport Research Laboratory Ltd (TRL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Transport Research Laboratory</gtr:description><gtr:id>369AA9DE-4D6E-4B70-AD4E-D5B3FEB8BF15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We held a one-day Novice Driver dissemination event on September 16th, 2014 hosted by TRL. Key findings were presented to non-academic beneficiaries, including the distinction between drivers who have an early risk of a crash after licensure, and those at risk of crash after the first six months of driving, as well as the role of unsafe attitudes to speed, and violations, in increasing probability of membership to one of these classes. The implications of our findings for practice and policy designed to reduce novice and young driver crash involvement was discussed, with Professor Frank McKenna (University of Reading) invited to discuss policy implications that arise from our analysis. In addition, Professor Chris Armitage (University of Manchester) talked about the application of our work to approaching behaviour change amongst young drivers. As a consequence of this event, a series of additional presentations are currently being organised with a number of organisations who were represented at the event, including government agencies (e.g., the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency), driver training organisations (e.g., The Driving Instructors Association, Institute of Advanced Motorists), and road safety organisations (e.g., Roadsafe).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546df06fcdf1f8.62042221-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>TRL contributed to analysis; Dr Graham Grayson and Barry Sexton, from TRL, were both central to the original Cohort II study in terms of data analysis and management.

The Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) were commissioned by the Department for Transport to run Cohort II. In the current project we ran advanced statistical analysis of data that had not been conducted in the construction of the original Cohort II report. The original Cohort II project explored the elevated crash risk of novice drivers, including identification of safer driving styles and behaviours associated with longer survival times. Our research team took the lead on analysis of the data and academic dissemination of results at international conferences. We identified classes of drivers with different risk profiles over the first three years of driving, and explored the attitudes and behaviours associated with different types of risk.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Institute of Advanced Motorists</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FAD59740-0CE2-409B-A64A-96AFBC0F18CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of a series of planned presentations with organisations with a vested interested in the latest road safety research.

This study applied the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) longitudinally over the first 3 years of driving. As a preliminary step we addressed modelling issues regarding the underlying structure of the DBQ using a bifactor model (Rowe et al., 2015 Measuring errors and violations on the road: A bifactor modeling approach to the Driver Behavior Questionnaire. Accident Analysis &amp;amp; Prevention, 74, 118-125). Next we modelled the development of driver behaviour using latent class growth curve modelling. This technique has been well used in other health behaviour domains, but this is a novel application to driving behaviour in a dataset of this sort. We found aberrant driving behaviour increased over time, and identified trajectory classes in risk-taking and errors that were defined by the initial level of aberrant behaviour (Roman et al., in prep), implying that road safety intervention should target pre-drivers to help them start on a safer trajectory. 
In relation to crash risk, longitudinal latent class analysis identified two trajectory classes: Drivers who crashed in the first 6 months of driving and subsequently had a low probability of crash involvement over the next 2.5 years, and drivers who did not have a crash in the first 6 months but had a persistently elevated risk for crash involvement over the next 2.5 years. Initial levels of all aberrant driving behaviours predicted membership of both crash risk groups, again highlighting the need for pre-driver interventions. Additionally, stronger increases in aggressive driving over time were related to persistently elevated crash risk, and negatively to high initial risk, indicating that interventions targeting aggression after licensure are also warranted (Poulter et al., in prep).
We have identified new research resources by linking the original collection of datasets into a single deposited dataset to expedite longitudinal analysis. Furthermore, our DBQ modelling work produced a shortened DBQ (Rowe et al., 2015) which we hope will facilitate its application in research and practice.
Important new research questions were raised by our research. We set out to identify the behavioural underpinnings of the dramatic decrease in novice crash risk over the early months of driving. We were puzzled that overall trends in risk-taking and errors, the best behavioural predictors of crash involvement, increased during this period. We hypothesised that heterogeneity in behavioural trajectories might underlie this discrepant pattern of findings, with the early reduction in crash risk possibly due to a sub-group of drivers initially high in risk-taking and then adopting a safer driving style. While our analyses did identify separable trajectory classes, none of the trajectories identified matched a pattern compatible with this hypothesis, indicating that simple changes in behaviour do not underlie the early decrease in crash involvement. Further research is required to explore alternative explanations.
Research capabilities were developed through training of the PI, the Co-I and the postdoctoral researcher on longitudinal growth modelling, factor analysis and data linking courses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>From a policy perspective, our results highlight the need for intervention in pre-driving while indicating that measures to address aggressive driving after licensure would also be useful. Further research addressing the design and validation of effective interventions, applying models of behaviour change from health psychology, will be required to realise this impact. Our results also further emphasise links between novice risk-taking and crash involvement and therefore contribute to debates addressing legislation and enforcement, such as the potential safety benefits offered by Graduated Driving Licencing. 
Project results have been disseminated via a one-day seminar at the Transport Research Laboratory, to an audience including representatives from government (e.g., Department for Transport), road safety charities (e.g., RoSPA) and training organisations (e.g., The Driving Instructors Association) amongst others. We have presented papers at the Life History Research Society Biennial Meeting (Pittsburgh), and the International Congress of Applied Psychology (Paris). We are continuing gold open-access publication, planning more presentations to practitioners, and developing a project website.
