The past decade has seen new facilities brought on stream in Europe and the US, with significant enhancement of the quality and effectiveness of instrumentation. Although measurements are frequently accompanied by computer simulation there is a lack of software and tools for the analysis of the data produced. The strong concurrence of the length- and time-scales involved also means that experiments provide an essential tool to benchmark simulations, with consequences for many fields of science. Analysis tools will be developed that use MD simulation data on self-assembling macromolecules for structure refinement. Progress will depend critically on the development of software tools such as we propose. The created software will support experimentalists and will allow third parties to benefit from the findings. The project will also have impact by producing a highly skilled development team and training material for transferring knowledge to a wider user community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project seeks to develop computational and analysis software for the Biological Sciences. Our new software will expand the utility of two community codes: NAMD-scalable molecular dynamics and VMD-visual molecular dynamics. The project will extend these codes to address the self assembly and self-organization of macromolecules (e.g., lipids and cholesterol, peptide dendrimers, etc.) into large complex supramolecular structures. Software will be developed that uses computer simulation data for structure refinement of neutron experimental data. Success will allow researchers to employ so-called coarse grain (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to: (i) explore MD simulation across multiple length scales to describe the emergence of complex structures from basic interactions of smaller units, and (ii) predict macroscopic properties, to be compared with and refine experiments and thus aid in the understanding of complex biological macrostructures.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The purpose of this project is to develop software and tools to analyze and interpret neutron scattering data produced in synchrotron facilities to be primarily used by anyone without prior knowledge of scripting skills, and exploit in this way world-wide costly facilities infrastructure to its fullest extent. The outcomes will be community software serving biochemists, physicists, and chemical bioengineers working in academe, industry and national labs. The participation by international collaborators clearly strengthens the extent to which this proposal will make an impact. 

The software modules developed for NAMD and VMD will be available on a publically accessible repository and developed as a set of open source, robust, self-contained, documented, unit-tested building blocks. The online resources will be supplemented by on-line tutorials and in the future workshops. The programs NAMD and VMD are employed by tens of thousands of researchers, with around 100,000 registered new users of VMD or NAMD during just the last five years alone. These two community codes play key roles in contemporary research, as stated in survey responses; many students and professional researchers worldwide also benefit from these programs, multiplying the impact of the software.

The first step in outreach in chronological order is the involvement of other scientists in the testing of newly developed code. Once added to revision control, a new feature in NAMD or VMD is available to external users, via source code and nightly build binaries and website documentation. Formal version releases occur approximately annually as major developments stabilize. Major releases are immediately preceded by a series of beta releases, between which only bug fixes and other minor, low-risk changes are allowed.

Concurrently with the software release process, the driving project, modeling neutron scattering from self assembling biomacromolecules will generate publications and presentations in seminars and at conferences, thereby demonstrating the new capability through scientific results. The driving project will then form the basis of tutorials/case studies. 

Participation in scientific meetings and seminars will also provide an opportunity to foster dialogue between the neutron scattering experimentalists working in the area of biological soft condensed matter and bionanoscience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>133323</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The lipopeptide surfactin produced by certain strains of Bacillus subtillis is a potent biosurfactant with high amphiphilicity and a strong tendency for self-aggregation. Surfactin possesses a number of valuable biological properties such as antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and hemolytic activities. Owing to these properties, in addition to the general advantages of biosurfactants over synthetic surfactants, surfactin has potential biotechnological and biomedical applications. Here, the aggregation properties of surfactin in solution together with its behavior at the water/air interface were studied using computational methods. Analysis of the MD trajectories supported conclusions about the distribution, conformations, and interactions of surfactin in solution and at the water-air interface. Considering altogether, the work presented provides atomistic models for the rationalization of some of the structural and dynamic characteristics as well as the modes of action of surfactin at different pH values.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The purpose of this project is to develop software and tools to analyze and interpret neutron scattering data produced in synchrotron facilities to be primarily used by anyone without prior knowledge of scripting skills, and exploit in this way world-wide costly facilities infrastructure to its fullest extent.
