As a consequence, comment is often uninformed, and important knowledge about the UK's influence on the EU, interaction between the UK and the EU, and the impact of EU action on UK policies and institutions is overlooked. Drawing on the applicant's research expertise, impact record, engagement experience and network of professional contacts in the UK and Brussels, this project proposes a programme of activities aimed at bringing research insights to international, national and regional audiences. It will provide evidence and analysis across the broad range of issues and policy areas affected by the UK's position in the EU, and thereby contribute towards the development of an authoritative and independent reference point for groups and individuals in search of high quality social scientific research on the UK's relationship with the EU, allowing debate about the UK's future to proceed on a more informed basis.

The envisaged activities will address three main themes:
- Getting its Own Way? The UK in Europe, which will assess the UK's record in securing its favoured outcomes
- From Whitehall to Brussels: The UK's influence in EU institutions, which will focus on the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council of the European Union
- Beyond the &amp;quot;Red Tape&amp;quot;: EU regulation and the UK, which will examine the effects of EU rules on UK institutions, interests and policies
The project will deliver outputs designed for a diverse range of audiences, using formats with which the applicant and his home department have considerable experience:
- Research briefings to be posted on the ESRC 'UK in a Change Europe' website at King's College London for those in need of authoritative research-based information in relation to the above themes
- Shorter briefings, written for the public, for quick reference on aspects of UK-EU relations
- Short blogs for 'The UK in a Changing world', LSE 'European Politics and Policy' or 'Eastminister'
- Press releases, where timely, on aspects of the three themes identified above to be disseminated by the UEA press office
- An event in London on 'Reviewing the record: UK membership of the EU', held at the British Academy, for parliamentarians, businesses, NGOs, and embassy staff
- An event in London on 'Reporting Europe: What the UK media does and does not communicate about Brussels', with a panel of representatives from academia, EU institutions, the UK diplomatic service and the media to discuss the role of the media in the UK's EU debate and to reflect on potential future developments, and aimed at journalists, civil servants, MPs, embassy staff, think-tanks and students
- An event, 'The EU and its Member States: star pupils, good soldiers and awkward partners', to review changing relations between the EU and national elites
- Meetings and seminars on the UK and Europe with think-tanks in London, Paris and Brussels
- A briefing in London to members of the Labour Party, then offered to other parties
- A workshop in Norwich, to be held at UEA, to which representatives of local public sector institutions, businesses, charities and other interest groups are invited
- A panel discussion in Norwich, open to the public, bringing together representatives of the four main political parties to debate the UK and Europe with academic specialists, recorded for podcasting
- Between four and six talks on the UK and the EU to sixth-formers in Schools and Colleges in the region 

The proposed project also includes a key international element. Using the applicant's network of contacts in the EU institutions, notably the Commission., the project will achieve impact by making presentations to senior staff on current debates in the UK concerning EU membership. 

Finally, the applicant will work closely with the Director and the other Senior Fellows.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The planned activities have been designed to communicate evidence and analysis of world-class research on the changing relationship between the UK and the EU through a series of outputs, targeted at a range of audiences at local and regional, national and international levels. They draw on the applicant's established networks among practitioner communities, as well as his experience of dissemination, impact and engagement activities. The proposed activities draw also on the local and regional profile of his home department, which over the past few years has created an infrastructure of contacts with politicians, political parties, public institutions, economic interests, NGOS, and schools in Norwich and Norfolk. The envisaged activities are directed towards four main audiences:
1. National stakeholders: Four pathways are planned for delivering impact among these constituencies: evidence briefings, based on the format developed by the ESRC 'The UK and Scotland' programme, to deliver syntheses of world-class research; shorter briefings - printable guides, using the terminology of 'The UK and Scotland', on specific topics; the organization of two events - 'Reviewing the record: UK membership of the EU' and 'Reporting Europe: What the UK media does and does not communicate about Brussels' - for politicians, businesses, interest groups, journalists, NGOs, foreign embassy staff, and students at the British Academy in London; and blogging on 'The UK in a Changing Europe', the LSE 'European Politics and Policy' or the UEA politics 'Eastminster'. Building on an earlier initiative, the applicant will use his contacts on the Labour Party front bench to explore the possibility of holding dedicated events on the UK in Europe for the shadow cabinet and MPs. If successful, the same will be offered to other political parties.
2. Regional audiences: The regions are often overlooked in major funding initiatives, but a core objective of the current project is to target public institutions, businesses, interest groups, NGOs, schools and the University of the Third Age, as well as media outlets, in the locality and the region. As well as utilising existing networks and writing to local bodies and business associations to offer talks on the UK and Europe, Kassim will host two events drawing on the profile and mailing lists developed by the Politics department at UEA: the first, will be on the UK and EU membership, and the second, to be held at the Epic studios in Norwich, where a panel composed of representatives from the four main parties in the locality, will be respond to research-based questions. Both events will be chaired by the Rt Hon Charles Clarke.
3. International audiences: If appointed, Kassim will draw on contacts developed as part of 'The European Commission in Question', as well as the ongoing project, 'European Commission: Facing the Future', to engage top officeholders in the European Commission, the School of European Administration, and other EU institutions to offer two or three briefings on the UK debate on Europe in the course of 2015-16. He will also write to colleagues in Universities in the UK, elsewhere in Europe, Japan and the US to offer talks on the same.
4. General public: As well as ensuring that accessible briefings are available on 'The UK in a Changing Europe' website for those interested in the UK's relationship with the EU, Kassim would issue press releases to accompany the publication of the most significant evidence briefings, send opinion pieces to broadsheet newspapers in the UK, prepare summary articles, and actively seek opportunities to discuss the UK and 'Europe' on local radio and in the national media. 
More generally, he would work individually and in collaboration with the Director and other Senior Fellows to participate in public discussion, discuss research issues, disseminate findings to relevant stakeholders, develop discussion networks, and otherwise work to further the aims of the call.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164660</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk on 'Where now for the UK and the EU?', Voices from Greece event, UEA, 26 February 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3EC6FF5B-A190-4B5F-BF88-AFE55AA24D55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk to mixed academic and non-academic audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c284ebdf5c61.58838931</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Appeared on BBC Radio Norfolk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9304AC18-269F-4DAF-9B63-043043837856</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I appeared three times on BBC Radio Norfolk: to discuss EU and the UK issues in the run up to the referendum, to conduct a radio phone-in before the referendum, and to consider the consequences on the morning after</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57f908aa308ae1.83988827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Event: 'The EU referendum.

British Academy, 24 May, 2016 brought together politicians, academic experts, campaigners and executives to consider the impact of EU regulation in the single market and beyond to address the following questions: How big is the regulatory burden imposed by EU rules for business in the UK? What are the costs and benefits of the single market for UK businesses and consumers? What are the benefits of EU policies in agriculture, employment, the environment, and social policy, and do they outweigh the regulatory costs? Would Brexit free the UK from EU regulation?

Does the UK get what it wants from the single market? Has the UK lost control over its borders? Does the EU increase, decrease or have no effect on the international influence of the UK? Addressed by politicians, representatives of campaign groups, think-tank analysts, and other professional practitioners.

Speakers addressed three questions: How influential is the UK within the EU? How effective is the UK in pursuing its interests in the EU? What is your assessment of what the UK can and cannot achieve inside the EU? The audience of 100+ included politicians, civil servants, business, trade unions, NGOs, think tanks, the media, campaign groups, and other interested groups.

This conference explored how the UK's membership of the EU and the possible outcomes of the UK referendum are seen from abroad. Among the questions it addressed were: What assessment do others make of the UK's contribution to the EU? What do others think of the UK's decision to call a referendum and what is their evaluation of the deal done by Prime Minister Cameron? What do they consider would be the consequences of a Brexit for the UK? How do they think a decision to leave on the UK's part would affect the EU, what would be the wider geopolitical impact of Brexit, and how would Brexit affect the UK's bilateral relationships, its security, and its role in the world?
The audience was attended by representatives of NGOs, campaign groups, think tanks, and the media, as well as academics, students, and interested members of the public.

Societal impact has been achieved through a number of pathways as follows:

? five international conferences in London that enabled the civil servants, diplomats, journalists from the national and international media, campaign organizations, and think tanks who attended (audiences of up to 200) to put their questions to specialists and practitioners from both sides of the debate, and the wider public who viewed the videos later made available on the 'UK in a Changing Europe' website to advance their understanding of key aspects of the relationship between the UK and the EU:

? a town hall event at the Epic studios in Norwich, 27 January 2016, which was also videoed (see https://www.uea.ac.uk/political-social-international-studies/events/the-uk-and-eu/uk-and-eu-ask-the-expert), as well as two 'ask the expert' events at the University of East Anglia, to enable members of the public in Norwich, Norfolk and beyond to put their questions about the UK and the EU to academic specialists

? 'UK and EU: to stay or to leave?&amp;quot;, an event for sixth-formers on 7 March 2016, attended by 101 pupils from nine schools in the East of England, that involved introductory sessions and independent study, and culminated in their putting questions to speakers representing 'Leave' and 'Remain' in a Q&amp;amp;A (https://www.uea.ac.uk/political-social-international-studies/events/the-uk-and-eu/uk-and-eu-to-stay-or-to-leave-)

? participation in community-organized events in venues in Norfolk and Suffolk, including Norwich Cathedral, Aylsham Church, Long Stratton High School, Wenhaston Community Centre, and the Belvedere Community Centre, to discuss the UK and the EU

? appearances on local and regional radio and TV, as well as interviews in the international media

? curation of a referendum website at the University of East Anglia, where academic specialists posted independent analysis of key issues and opinion pieces on both sides of the debate, to inform interested citizens and others about the UK and the EU

? organization of a 'Brexit or Bremain?' panel for a discussion of the referendum and its significance for the UK and the EU at the European Policy Centre in Brussels, 8 March 2016. The event had an audience of 130

? explainers (briefings) on the EU institutions, posted on the 'UK in a Changing Europe' website, http://ukandeu.ac.uk

? contribution to the 'Leave/Remain: the Facts behind the Claims', leaflet scrutinising the main contentions made by the two sides of the campaign produced in accessible language for interested citizens and groups, http://ukandeu.ac.uk/research-papers/leaveremain-the-facts-behind-the-claims/

In the run up to the referendum, the objective was to provide analysis that enabled citizens to make a more informed decision as to how they might cast their vote. Since the referendum, the main ambition has been to enable citizens in the East of England to explore the implications of the decision to leave. The main impact pathway has been a series of public lectures organized at the University of East Anglia, '&amp;quot;Brexit means Brexit&amp;quot;, but what does that mean?', which has given the 100-200 attendees - mostly members of the general public - the opportunity to listen and put their questions to academic specialists and practitioners. Details below; videoed highlights can be viewed at: https://www.uea.ac.uk/political-social-international-studies/events/brexit-series. The seven events were as follows:

? 17 November 2016: Brexit and the future of UK politics, Alan Finlayson, UEA, Marina Prentoulis, UEA, Chris Hanretty, UEA, and Iain Dale, LBC and UEA
? 24 November 2016: Brexit and the future for UK business, UEA, Thomas Sampson, LSE, Jonathan Portes, NIESR, and ESRC 'UK in a Changing Europe' Senior Fellow, Angus Armstrong, NIESR and ESRC 'UK in a Changing Europe' Senior Fellow, and Luke Morris, 'Business for Britain' East of England organizer

The initiative's central objective was to communicate knowledge about the UK and the EU that had been mainly confined to the academic community to decision makers, stakeholders and the general public locally, nationally and regionally. The award objectives were met and indeed surpassed. The most significant achievements were as follows:

First, the organization in advance of the referendum of five major international conferences on key themes relevant to the UK and the EU, namely: the UK's influence in the EU, how the EU is reported by the British media, the impact of EU regulation in the UK, external perceptions of the UK's membership of the EU, and UK membership of the EU as seen by British citizens who have served in EU institutions. Held in central London and addressed by leading experts from politics (e.g. Nigel Lawson, Michael Howard, Daniel Hannan, Charles Clarke, Jos&amp;eacute; Manuel Barroso, Enrico Letta), academia (e.g. Margaret MacMillan, Piers Ludlow) and the media (e.g. Anne McElvoy, Nick Robinson, Jonathan Fenby), the conferences were attended by politicians, the national and international media, diplomats, campaign groups, think tanks, affected interests, and members of the general public. Proceedings were communicated via social media and video highlights of the panels made available on the multimedia section of the 'UK in a Changing Europe' website (see individual entries under 'engagement' for URLs).

Second, a programme of events directed at local and regional audiences. In the run-up to the referendum, these featured a town hall event, two 'ask the expert' events, and an event for sixth formers, which culminated in a Q&amp;amp;A where students put their questions to supporters of the two campaigns. Since the referendum a seven-part public lecture series, '&amp;quot;Brexit means Brexit&amp;quot;, but what does that mean?', where academic specialists and practitioners addressed key questions, such as the likely impact of Brexit on UK politics, on UK business, on British citizens and taxpayers, on the UK as political union, on migration, immigration and community relations, and on UK expats. The events were filmed and edited videos made available as relevant on the 'UK in a Changing Europe' or the University of East Anglia's website.

Third, I participated by invitation as an independent expert, chair or panel member at a range of community-organized events in venues as diverse as Norwich Cathedral, Wenhaston Village Hall, the Belvedere Community Centre, Long Stratton High School, and the West Norfolk Deaf Community, and gave talks at schools in Norwich.

Finally, I made a number of appearances on the broadcast media and gave interviews to the international press. I also worked closely with the Director of the programme, was involved in several collaborations with other Senior Fellows, including the organization of a panel hosted by a leading think tank in Brussels, and contributed to collective publications, including the newsletter, and wrote a number of explainers that were published on the 'UK in a Changing Europe' website.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As a knowledge transfer project, the 'UK in a Changing Europe' Fellowship enabled me to organise events, produce materials, and make interventions that communicated expertise on the UK and the EU to a variety of non-academic audiences at local, regional, national and international levels. Through these activities, it was possible to advance understanding of the key topics and themes. The feedback, particularly from events aimed at the general public, has been extremely positive.

Materials continue to be available for reference and use. Many of the events were covered in the national and sometimes the international press, in blog and multimedia reports, and on social media. The conferences, a number of the public lectures (including Q&amp;amp;A), and some of the other events were filmed and the videos made available on the project or University website, allowing wider audiences to enjoy access and ensuring that the activities will have enduring value.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E864248F-6048-4905-B811-FE8CE8F53AEA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e029f78e6f67.89564991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ukandeu.ac.uk/event/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N00437X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
