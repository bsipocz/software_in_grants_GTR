It is timely and innovative in approach and networks together a key set of academics working in different global contexts. It addresses a gap in current knowledge exchange and seeks to redress the balance of focus from the existing highly urbanised, first-world contexts to concentrate on more marginalised urban communities and people-centred urban change in relation to ICTs. The network activities delivered through a series of workshops will address the topic of the impact of digital marginalisation in the 'Smart City' context and its effect on urban space. It will explore models and tools for urban change within marginalised communities, by investigating and analysing positive and negative initiatives developed through the smart city approach. Within this context of what can be considered sustainable urban development in marginalised communities it aims to question how ICTs contribute to this process. The network will investigate a series of Smart city projects in a series of global contexts to study and understand how marginalised communities can appropriate and benefit from impacts of ICTs within the city.
The network works with the framework of Henri Lefebvre's seminal work The Right to the City to consider the role of everyday and people centred agency in urban change. Taking the right to the city, the network questions 'Whose right to the &amp;quot;Smart&amp;quot; City&amp;quot;. The current Smart City agenda, championed and promoted by ICT companies such as IBM and global city leaders is problematic, since it adopts a technologically deterministic approach that homogenises urban problems across different economic, political, social and cultural contexts. It tends to focus on ICT solutions to be applied top-down, and therefore, fails to address particular issues related to different types of marginalised communities. The network seeks to counter this approach by exchanging and mapping examples of knowledge of ICTs and marginalised urban contexts to understand how such communities might benefit from ICT driven change and how this might support a 'right to the city'. 

The network workshops will adopt a case study method and will have an open and discursive ethos. Each workshop will comprise contributions from selected invited guest speakers to represent local areas of expertise and knowledge, activities with early stage and doctoral researchers as well as a field visit with selected local community stakeholders. Early stage researchers will be invited to participate in an open forum session and to contribute to forming the outcomes of the workshop meetings. 

The concluding symposium event will take place in Plymouth; comprised of a series of focused sessions with presentation of the investigators of all partner universities and of other related work. Guest speakers will also be invited from a range of disciplinary and sectorial backgrounds. This will close with an open forum session to determine crosscutting similarities and differences between the different forms of marginalisation discussed along the partnership, possible guidelines for further research and case studies. 

Knowledge exchange and the outcomes of the workshops will be documented and shared through a website mapping platform. This will act as a live and open platform to disseminate the work of the network as well as providing a tangible outcome as a mapping of knowledge. This will make the work of the network available to the wider community, and will be supported by an ongoing use of social media (e.g. Twitter) to share work in progress.

The network will produce an edited book with contributions from all network partners, as well as a co-authored journal paper. The network website will also be developed from the outset of the project and act as a mode of dissemination of the academic outcomes to a broader audience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has impact built in to its working method. It addresses a real world topic that is currently engaging a whole series of stakeholders in cities around the world. In addition the focus on exchanging knowledge across different global contexts on a shared research problem will enable impact at a range of geographical scales. 
 
Impact will be achieved through four complementary groups of activities: 
 
-Involvement and knowledge exchange with stakeholders and private and public sector non HE representatives; 
Invited participants in the network workshops from local community and governance stakeholders will enable us to constructively engage with stakeholders of local ICT initiatives and establish a dialogue. The final symposium will extend this approach, with a key set of invited stakeholders involved in smart city initiatives that operate within marginalised urban contexts. 

-Disseminating work in progress and outcomes with public sector, private sector and community Stakeholders 
The workshop activities will involve establishing a dialogue with key stakeholders on the partner countries, who are working on or planning smart city initiatives. This dialogue will be continued through the course of the Network activities, and the outcomes of the Network will be aimed at sharing and disseminating knowledge in an accessible and appropriate format.

-Engagement with the broader public using website, social media, among others.
A variety of social media activities will be used to disseminate work in progress to the academic community. The network website will also be a source of information and news about the project aims, objectives, outcomes and also provide material to download and share.

Knowledge transfer and external engagement through a dynamic web platform;
The development of a specialist web platform will enable external exchange and knowledge sharing of the network activities. It will be a public accessible face to non-academic partners at both a local and an international level.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35276</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mapping workshop in Vila des Antenas Favela, Belo Horizonte, Brazil</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B5B6076-9434-4686-BDA7-434ECD83A9D1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a mapping activity at Vila das Antenas, a favela in Belo Horizonte where we used mapping tools to investigate how local people use technologies in the favela.

Workshop Activities and Outcomes
Location: T. Nagar district, Chennai
Day one was spent completing an afternoon mapping exercise in T.Nagar, Chennai.
T.Nagar is a neighborhood in Chennai where the Smart City Proposal plans to implement the Area-Based plan. The group met at Panagal park and was given a short introduction to the mapping technology and the paper maps. Each group was assigned a street to map using Kobo, a digital survey and mapping tool, and a paper map for more details and notes. They were told to look at elements on each street falling under the themes of housing, mobility, amenities, and recreation. After completing the streets the groups reconvened at the park to discuss their observations from the exercise.
For T Nagar, the city's proposal lists assured (24x7) supply of electricity and water, recycling waste water by augmenting sewage treatment capacities, rain water harvesting, and storm water management by monitoring using sensors. It also proposes several transport-related infrastructure projects, including cycle tracks, e-rickshaws with solar charging stations, smart parking for on-street parking, multi-level car parks, intelligent traffic systems for smart signalling, and automated street lights.
Discussion topics
The mapping exercise was meant to prompt participants to look at street level infrastructure in detail and visualize the ways in which the smart city proposal for Chennai could impact the area. After returning from the mapping exercise the group discussed each group's experiences and key takeaways. The discussion centred around people's observations of street infrastructure, including flyovers, barriers, and waste bins. Additionally, observations focused on discussions with street hawkers and local vendors about their knowledge of the smart cities.

Key themes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the importance and abundance of informal activities in the street
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the visibility of formal and informal infrastructure of rubbish, water, sewage, telecoms and electricity in the street
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; conflicts between vehicle and pedestrians
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the smart city as proposed in the SCM seems very far removed from the everyday life of the
T. Nagar district.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; difficult to envisage how the water, waste, ICT and transportation objectives of the SCM will be realised.

The key outcomes were knowledge exchange with a number of key third sector partners. The context for the workshop was the India Smart Cities Mission which had been launched a few months earlier. A number of the participants had been marginalised by the smart cities mission and found the workshop invaluable to gain information and plan future initiatives which would create a counter strategies to the top-down projects. Theses included the chair of the National Hawkers Federation, whose 40 million members face being evicted from the streets where they make their livelihood as part of the Smart City Mission plans, which advocate a wester style 'sanitisation' of the streetscape.
Other participants such as Brinda Sastry and Durganand Balsavar had acted as consultants to policy makers in the Smart Cities Mission and used the workshop as an opportunity to inform themselves about the potential issues of marginalisation and lack of citizenship within the programme. They reported that they would feed this back in to their work on the development of the policy at government level.

key areas of concern for the Smart City Mission.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; overview of work with GIS to represent citizenship of local fishermen in Chennai regeneration projects by Saravanan Kasi.

Discussion topics
The discussions that followed the presentations raised questions about the structure, legal framework, and financing of the Special Purpose Vehicle, the search for a different model of state development, the role of technology in urban development, and the role of citizens in the SCM. Key concerns
centred around how little we know about the legal aspects and structure of the SPV making it extremely hard to understand the repercussions it could
have for city governance and accountability. Additionally, many participants felt that many of the concerns arising from the Smart Cities Mission were
concerns that were mirrored in other development programs in India - supposedly due to the ingrained corruption within politics - and thus that
the SCM was not addressing underlying systems that led to unequal and exclusionary development.
The group further stressed that the term &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; should be re-evaluated with respect to the citizens. For example, many expressed concerns that previous missions such as the JNNURM failed on various counts, and that the SCM would have similarly disastrous effects on the demography. The
group agreed that we should look at &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; as implying an evaluative, flexible and retrospective/reflective approach to urban and technological
renewal as opposed to a blindly futuristic and idealistic proposition that certainly would not prioritize citizenship and the multitudinous livelihoods without which the city would not truly function.

Key themes
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; issues of privatisation of urban services, resources and infrastructure though SPV
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; problematic of governance due to set up of SPV and lack of transparency/accountability
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCM was not addressing underlying systems that led to unequal and exclusionary development
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCM builds very clearly on previous urban renewal and regeneration projects (such as the JNNURM), but seems to show little reference to these
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That informal inhabitants and users of the street such as street traders will be excluded and evicted in the SCM
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The impacts of smart city projects are often in the poorer and hidden districts of the city. For instance the water initiatives will be met by creating a desalination plant in Ponneri, a smaller city on the outskirts of Chennai</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c910c18cd7e9.69321243</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://whosesmartcity.net/publications-and-outcomes/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>14500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>BRL</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Brazil</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>pt_BR</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Newton CONFAP Researcher Mobility</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>NHS Direct NHS Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/confap-announces-approved-projects-under-call-with-uk-academies</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>17FF7C04-E98E-4911-BC2A-7C3990F0B04F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c69dd93034a6.58648998</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In the AHRC network workshopResearch Fish outcomes

Narrative Impact

In the AHRC network workshop

The network has delivered two key events - the first in Chennai, India in June 2016 and the second in Belo Horizonte, Brazil in December 2016.
At both events there have been a series of activities that have engaged a range of stakeholders; from third sector, academia, policy makers and community representatives.

Two key areas of impact can be identified:
1) Third sector stakeholders who represent marginalized groups or communities who participated in the workshops in Chennai and Belo Horizonte. Through the information shared and the discussions about the scope, range and implementation of smart city projects in the respective countries, they have gone on to inform their members about strategies to counter these dominant paradigms. The key stakeholders who have benefited from the engagement and knowledge sharing are:

India - National Hawkers Federation, India (membership of over 40 million street vendors nationally)- The General Secretary of the Federation Mr Shaktiman Ghosh attended the workshop along with a small team. The livelihood of many of their members is under threat due to the Smart Cities Mission in India, as the programme includes actions for 'sanitising' the streets in the Indian city districts identified to be transformed into smart city demonstrator projects. The smart city mission plans include a strategy that encourages a streetspace that is 'smart' where traffic, vendors and water and waste infrastructure are transformed into a wester model of a clean, efficient streetscape. This is massively at odds with way that Indian streetscapes operate- where a whole series of informal activities take place, such as street vending, informal parking, and ad hoc infrastructures. Through the workshop activities he reported that he had learned about the ways in which his members could challenge the dominant smart city actions, and try to ensure that they would not result in his members being dispossessed from the streets where they work. 

Brazil - In Brazil we engaged with the community group - History under Construction who represent the people of the Favela of Vila des Antenas in Belo Horizonte. The Brazilian national smart city initiative was initiated in September 2016, and is yet to be fully implemented in Brazil. But through the Network workshop activities the group became aware that they will be excluded from any benefits of such initiatives when they are implemented because their community is not recognized by the state. The focus of Brazilian Smart city initiatives is around digital inclusion, and we discussed approaches that they could use to capitalize on informal smart projects that they already have, but have been fairly fragmented. The workshop included a mapping day where we interviewed over 30 locals residents about how they use ICTs in their lives, and understanding whether these were accessed through informal (semi-illegal) infrastructures or more formal ones. This resulted in an awareness raising in the community about the need to recognize ICT access as an asset and its links to accessing jobs, wider social networks and resources. This is in a community that is very rarely informed or engaged with through traditional governmental routes, so this had an impact as it simply wouldn't have happened if we had not had the opportunity to speak with them.

2) The second set of stakeholders are policy makers or those acting as consultants who inform policy around smart cities in India and Brazil.

Brazil - Mr America Bernardes,&amp;nbsp;Minister responsible for the Brazilian Smart City (Cidade Intelligente) Programme, Secretary of Digital Inclusion, Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication, Brazil
Mr Bernardes participated in the workshop in Belo Horizonte, and engaged in active discussion about the impact of smart city projects on marginalized groups in Brazil and how this could be overcome. He is the minister responsible for delivering the Cidide Intelligent programme in Brazil, and told us that he was attending the workshop to gain some insights in to how his work could be informed by the research being undertaken. He took on board some of the findings from the previous Indian workshop, and we discussed having input into future planning of smart city projects in Brazil. In particular he recognised that it was an opportunity to understand how a similar large scale Smart Cities project in India had pitfalls and issues in its implementation with regard to marginalised groups and how these could be addressed in his programme in Brazil. This work is to be followed up by the Brazilian network partner, Prof Ana Paula Baltazar, and with a set of her colleagues in the School of Architecture, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Mr Bernardes will also now participate in the third workshop in London in September 2017.
India - Durganand Balsavar, Architect and Brinda Sastry, Urban Planner have both have acted as consultants to the Indian government on the Smart Cities Mission. Through participating in the workshop they have gained specific insights into the needs of marginalized groups, such as the street hawkers. They discussed how they would take the knowledge and use it to inform future government consultation about the importance of recognizing the needs and resources required by marginalized groups to access the benefits of the Indian Smart Cities Mission.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B0CC0BF2-C754-460B-8C3F-E1AF02B31338</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c90cb3425960.43649072</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There are three areas of outcomes.

The second is linked to a review of methods for mapping and representing smart city projects and access to these by marginalised groups. The third is around creating a network of information and knowledge exchange with a wider set of partners and stakeholders to snowball communication.
The workshops completed so far have three main outputs:
? Created an agenda for researching and understanding the Indian SCM and Brazilian Cidade Inteligente projects
? Developed and tested out methods for mapping, enabling and evaluating smart citizenship 
? Created a network of partners that could use and contribute to further research, knowledge building and action around the Indian Smart Cities Mission and Brazilian Cidade Inteligente programme. 

In the first area, we have successfully informed a wide range of stakeholders from both marginalised groups to policy makers about the implications of smart city programmes for communities who have either been excluded from accessing the benefits of the initiatives or who are actually being negatively affected. We found that providing access to data was a key area of work that needs to be completed, and that current dissemination and consultation initiatives are either extremely limited or simple non existent for these groups. Therefore the knowledge exchange and communication activities of the workshops in India and Brazil have had a significant impact in giving community groups capacity to challenges these projects and ensure that their needs (rights) are recognised. This work is being continued by the country partners; CAG (civic Action Group, Chennai, India) and LAGEAR lab (University of Minas Gerais, Brazil).

In the second area, we have tested a series of mapping techniques in a workshop in India and Brazil for making information about smart city projects geo-located in the communities into which they are planned to be implemented. This was a challenging exercise within the scope of the network. But this is now being developed in to a mapping platform that will prototype an alternative mapping method that can be used by marginalised groups. This involved identifying the infrastructures and resources within communities that are enabled or challenged by smart city initiatives and how these can be represented in a mapping platform in an accessible manner. 

In the third area, we have established a wider network of stakeholders from a wide range of sectors with whom we are exchanging knowledge and building capacity. The knowledge exchange between UK, Brazil and India and the networking of partners from these three countries has been excellent in enabling network partners to recognised common problems that transcend cultural and geographic boundaries, and also to learn about alternative ways of addressing challenges. For example the strategies learned from the favela community in Brazil about how to harness informal infrastructures (internet access and power/water) to gain access to the benefits of technologies has informed thinking and possible future initiatives in India and UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As outlined above:
1) Marginalised groups in develpoping counter strategies and initiatives to benefit from smart city projects, from which they are currently excluded.
2) Policy makers through learning about the needs of marginalised groups (such as slum dwellers, street traders and those working within the informal economy) to benefit from smart city initiatives</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4AA44D0F-B087-4E14-AFFD-5968C3FC724C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c92bc186df48.44348743</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://whosesmartcity.net/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a prototype of mapping software and platform that will represent smart city projects from the perspective of the citizen.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2D9C4E39-D901-4E68-9F16-100A5F79F6AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This platform is in development, but will be shared with marginalised groups to enable them to have access to information about the impact of smart cities in their own cities and countries.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c698882bdf97.61484580</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Mapping software</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://tcn.cag.org.in/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77ACA2B1-FB73-4C0A-9157-BAA5ACA8ED9D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digital and Smart Cities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/63813523e381b1cf9215ff53bd704b9c"><gtr:id>63813523e381b1cf9215ff53bd704b9c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Willis</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>1138890383</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7fbcec61271.56402960</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>948A0A5B-F46E-4965-9033-EFA7977C03C4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Smart Citizenship Workshop Report, Chennai, India.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/858eb3b8527553a8eee3df48f727c47c"><gtr:id>858eb3b8527553a8eee3df48f727c47c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Katharine Willis</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c69cd9b30f77.08963346</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A9223F5-B91B-4457-B9E0-A7F832054713</gtr:id><gtr:title>Intelligence is Open: Smart City versus Open City</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>plaNext - next generation planning</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6a2c59ebdd60fc0b21c54e75fd344065"><gtr:id>6a2c59ebdd60fc0b21c54e75fd344065</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pinheiro R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7fb8d9b2383.84497176</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>52D0CCBB-A848-4966-9CE5-4BD90B1A6856</gtr:id><gtr:title>Editorial: Social Smart Cities: Reflecting on the Implications of ICTs in Urban Space</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>plaNext - next generation planning</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f2b824b41cb45662527c428b47b7336c"><gtr:id>f2b824b41cb45662527c428b47b7336c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Melga?o L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7fb4f483206.87230380</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N004264/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
