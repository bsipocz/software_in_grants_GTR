&lt;p>The project will interview heath facilities, shops and wholesalers in all sectors, in urban and rural contexts, about their procurement practices and problems.

It should be read alongside Pathways to Impact.

Early impacts
These benefits arise in part from limited connection at present between health and industrial policymaking and the ideas and knowledge that inform them, in the two countries and internationally. The beneficiaries, with type of benefit, are:
Health procurement agencies, government, NGO and private, in Kenya and Tanzania, who will gain enhanced understanding of local suppliers' production capabilities and scope for upgrading, hence better information for procurement decisions;
Health policymakers, who will gain enhanced understanding of the local and import supply chains into the health system and the conditions under which upgrading can improve inclusion, enlarging their scope for beneficial intervention;
Private businesses, who will gain additional market knowledge and enhanced scope for interaction with industrial and health policymakers, and information about funding and support opportunities, widening their options for business development; 
Professional bodies such as manufacturing associations representing private business, who will gain another route into engagement with relevant policy makers; 
Industrial development and innovation policymakers, who will gain enhanced understanding of health system needs and scope for collaboration with health policymakers to identify opportunities to support socially beneficial and commercially viable product and process innovations; 
Policymakers in other low income countries facing similar conditions, through generation of ideas for improved integration of health and industrial policymaking;
International policymakers (United Nations, multilateral organisations, bilateral donors, public-private partnerships, African organisations such as NEPAD and the African Development Bank): in health, the project will provide additional understanding of industrial capabilities and industrial constraints on health system performance; in industrial and innovation policymaking the project will provide additional understanding of health system opportunities and constraints.

Longer term impacts.
The central hypothesis of the project is that there are unexploited synergies between industrial development and health system strengthening. If this is shown to be correct, and opportunities for mutual benefit are identified and exploited, then the ambition is to benefit:
 
Health service users, male and female, who currently face severe shortage of essential supplies, gaining improvements in the cost, quality and availability of supplies that lead to improvements in access to effective care;
Health professionals, whose ability to work effectively will be enhanced by improved supplies, resulting in better quality and more inclusive services;
Health and industrial innovation policy makers, whose ability to support industrial improvement and strengthen health systems will results in higher productivity and quality and fewer stock-outs;
Industrial employees through upgrading of productivity and skills and increased employment opportunities in local production of health service supplies; 
Inclusive growth beneficiaries, as industrial firms exploit newly identified opportunities in strengthened supply chains, and the workforce benefits from improved health services, enhancing labour productivity;
International donors and policy makers through identification, evaluation and exploitation of new routes by which funding can support private sector activity to strengthen health systems;
Industrial and health policy not only in Tanzania, Kenya but also elsewhere, through demonstration of the benefits of collaboration between the two fields.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>561720</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Are manufacturers in Tanzania losing out and what can be done?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>155975C4-4E66-4C86-981F-8CDC44403D84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion and debate on policy options

We have also provided evidence that has influenced international thinking among UN policy actors, international NGOs, international business associations, and researchers feeding into policy in health services procurement and industrial development and innovation. 
In summary, the following impacts have been achieved to date. 
1) Bringing together health and industrial stakeholders to share results and encourage dialogue. 
Three successful Policy Dialogue workshops, two in Dar es Salaam and one in Nairobi, have brought together high-level industrial and health policy makers, industrial CEOs, regulators and distributors/ procurement heads in Tanzania and Kenya to discuss project findings; in some cases, this was participants' first exploration of the extent of local sourcing of health products and the complex policy issues involved. In both countries, these workshops, all held under Chatham House rules, have each been followed by requests to which the project team has responded for further engagement and information, in the form of briefings, policy recommendations, media interviews and invitations to participate in subsequent policy meetings. In Tanzania, the project team subsequently submitted invited policy recommendations to a national Task Force on Promotion of Local Pharmaceutical Production. Two high-level follow-up meetings in Dar es Salaam continued the health-industrial policy dialogue, at both of which project team members gave invited presentations: see below.
2) Contributing to national and regional policy shifts. 
Over our project life cycle there has been a marked increase in interest in supporting local pharmaceutical production and debating implications for health policy; this has been driven by a number of interests and pressures. The project has contributed Policy Briefs, information from Working Papers, and organised forums for debate to support these policy developments. A key example is the East African Community secretariat's National Steering Committee on the pharmaceutical sector, which organised a workshop in Dar es Salaam, March 2015; this was opened by the Tanzanian Deputy Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Industry and Trade, who, in her opening speech cited extensively the findings of the project regarding the decline of the pharmaceutical industry in Tanzania and the scope for reversal. A second example is the 1st East Africa Manufacturing Business Summit organized by the East Africa Community and East African Business Council in Kampala 1-2 September 2015; an invited presentation on the sources of the challenge facing Tanzanian pharmaceuticals was well received and both the Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Association and the EAC Secretariat agreed to take up our findings for action; they indicated that they have been hearing similar messages from manufacturers but this time the messages will be taken more seriously because they come from independent research. Within Tanzania, furthermore, high-level policy dialogues to which project team members have been invited include an UNCTAD-organized High Level Capacity workshop (November 2015) on Policy Coherence for Local Pharmaceutical Production and Access to Medicines in Tanzania; and a workshop on Policy Coherence for Health Technology Access and Delivery, co-organized by UNDP, COSTECH and Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children (MOHCDGEC); in the latter workshop the key policy ministries participated (Health, Industry and Planning Commission), and the project team were instrumental in ensuring that planners involved in drafting industrial strategy, for which pharmaceuticals has now become a priority sector (previously it was not), were fully represented. In Nairobi, the project book, Making Medicines in Africa: the Political Economy of Industrialization for Local Health was launched by invitation at the Africa Pharmaceutical Summit East, March 2016, where the book, published under a creative commons licence, was widely downloaded by a large audience of pharmaceutical manufacturers and associated practitioners. Team members have written an background paper for the forthcoming Tanzania Human Development Report 2017, and presented it at a high level policy workshop.
3) Contributing to the emergent body of international policy work on African and LIC health-industry linkages and local industrial policy for pharmaceuticals.
When we began this project, the relevance of local pharmaceutical production in African to health or industrial development objectives was internationally widely contested; the consensus has since been shifting sharply over the last three years, and the project has contributed to the shift in recognised ways. Our evidence of the contribution to local production to rural medicines access, and of trust in established local branded generics, has been presented to local manufacturers' forums and subsequently widely cited. Project team members have presented evidence to a WHO-hosted consultation on local production and medicines access; to an NGO-hosted European consultation on the same topic; to an internal policy session in an international health NGO; and to a UK Parliamentary Select Committee on Health Systems Strengthening. The project team has developed a continuing dialogue with UNIDO officials involved in supporting the African Union Commission's Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa, and associated regional plans. In this context we have contributed to strengthening expert African networking and participation, by academics and practitioners, in international debates on this theme; the outcome of that active networking was UNIDO support and funding for an international project workshop on Making Medicines in Africa, and the resultant open-access edited book (Palgrave Macmillan 2016) drawing on a wide range of African as well as Brazilian, Indian and high income country experience and expertise. Presentations based on the book have resulted in extensive debate in forums including manufacturers, policy makers and innovation researchers; a book launch in London was opened by senior officer from the African Union Commission and was well attended by academics. The project team members and book contributors are now regarded as international contributors to a marked shift in policy thinking, to which we will continue to contribute, with an emphasis on ensuring that African expertise makes its full contribution to international debates in this field. Our UN networking continues to expand: a recent submission to the UN Secretary General's High Level Panel on Access to Medicines was selected for Skype-presentation by a project team member (Mackintosh, March 2016) and question-and-answer discussion with the UN panel sitting in Johannesburg; we were an invited contributor to the UNCTAD World Investment Forum Session on Access to Medicines in Africa (July 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>85B77263-CDEE-4652-BCF9-CCC786795681</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>559278a32bb009.86039534</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This policy-focused project uniquely combines analysis of low-income country health care systems with a corresponding investigation into local manufacturing capacity. There are huge unmet needs for essential medicines and supplies in Tanzania and Kenya, as in many African countries, and domestic health markets offer large unexploited opportunities for locally based manufacturers. 
In summary the project has identified: 
? the extent of opportunities to combine better health care with industrial development;
? strengths and weaknesses of domestic supply chain linkages, and external pressures that tend to disaggregate them; 
? the core challenge faced by locally based firms of upgrading to achieve and sustain international competitiveness; 
? existing policies that support or undermine health-industrial synergies; 
? the reshaping of health systems and procurement required to use local suppliers effectively to address population needs.
A conceptual framework of industrial and institutional capabilities is used to show how industrial suppliers of essential medicines and medical supplies in both countries face sharply rising international competitive pressures. These result from: broader trade liberalisation and specific policies encouraged by donors to remove tariffs and taxes from imported health sector supplies; externally focused international procurement; competitive and regulatory pressures for higher quality standards; and changes in first line treatments for major illnesses requiring investment in technological upgrading. All domestic manufacturers interviewed engaged in continuous upgrading: hugely challenging in their context of poor infrastructure, expensive and limited industrial finance, and low education and skills (particularly serious in Tanzania). 
In both countries, pharmaceutical companies are mainly locally owned, and in neither country is their domestic market share rising. In Tanzania local pharmaceutical firms' domestic market share has recently been falling sharply as they struggle to cope with competitive pressures. Kenya-based producers are doing better within a much stronger national industrial base, sustaining domestic market share and increasing exports to regional markets. Both sets of firms need industrial policy frameworks that support sustained investment in improved technological capabilities, including upstream supplier improvement, associated with sufficient time-limited trade protection. 
Health sector organisation and procurement processes also need to build the collaborative capabilities to extract local health-industrial synergy. Damaging and exclusionary reliance on out-of-pocket payments, and doubtfully sustainable reliance on Asian suppliers, both need revision towards more tax and social insurance funding for supplies and public procurement policies that reduce barriers to entry for local firms. There are lessons from good procurement practice in the non-profit sectors, which were found to purchase a higher share of their supplies from domestic manufacturers while private wholesalers relied more on imports. 
Collaborative capabilities in industrial and health policy have to be built, from a basis of very limited communication between relevant Ministries and international stakeholders. The project has created local forums for industrialists, industrial and health policy makers, regulators and medical officers to interact directly, opening possibilities for creative interventions to radically improve effective governance in this crucial area of development. Internationally, the project has contributed to expanding research in this field, notably through a UNIDO-supported publishing initiative on Making Medicines in Africa drawing on experience from nine African countries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our project findings are being actively used by industrial and health policy makers in both Tanzania and Kenya. For example, our research findings on the Tanzanian pharmaceutical sector have been taken up in the Tanzanian government's new Five-year Development Plan &amp;quot;Nurturing Industrialization for Economic Transformation and Human Development&amp;quot;, where pharmaceuticals are identified as a key industrial sector for development. The relevant Plan text argues that local production of medicines can both enhance access to medicines and contribute to inclusive economic growth, before discussing how and why the local share of the market is in decline, and the scope for reversal through active policy support. This policy impact follows invited recommendations from this project to a Tanzanian policy Task Force hosted by the Commission for Science and Technology. We continue to contribute findings and advice to: Tanzanian and Kenyan high level policy forums (see our Impact summary for more details); broader African and international policy debate on local production of essential medical supplies, through UN-hosted forums (UNIDO, WHO, UNDP), African Union consultations, and regional initiatives; private sector manufacturers' organisations and conferences (e.g. those hosted by PharmaAfrica); international NGO consultations and initiatives (including Health Action International, Action Medeor, MSF). Our publications and policy briefs have been cited by both private sector and public policy actors in the very active policy field of local pharmaceutical production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our project book, &amp;quot;Making Medicines in Africa&amp;quot;, was based in a UNIDO-supported workshop that drew together a wide range of impressive African expertise, as well as experience from India, Brazil and high income countries, in a mutual learning process; the book was published under Creative Commons, free to download, and has been very widely cited, especially within African policy debates, where its accessibility, timeliness and depth have been appreciated. We continue to contribute to ensuring that international debates on this topic fully reflect the views, expertise and objectives of African and Africa-based policy makers, regulators, manufacturers and other relevant actors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DF349CC1-CAA1-4776-80B0-BB82807C8191</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55926975b9c475.15319352</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://iphsp.acts-net.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation of output in Tanzania Second Five Year Development Plan</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BAF2BEAD-A7F7-4A61-A870-A0E67323F0A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The findings of the research in Tanzania has been quoted in the Tanzanian Second Five Year Development Plan, in the section on industrial policy.
