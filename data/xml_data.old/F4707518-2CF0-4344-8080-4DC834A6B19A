Future</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M00452X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Academic Book of the Future has been a matter of intense concern and debate for the last 20 years. Monographs, collections of essays and critical editions are the cornerstone of scholarship in the humanities, and the careers of many rest on the production of books, and the credit given to them, through the regular Research Excellence Framework (REF). But they are uneconomic to produce, given that they sell in small numbers, and as libraries are squeezed in two directions (falling budgets and rising serials prices) a steadily decreasing number are bought into core collections. In the past, publishers accepted that academic books would not make profits, or indeed, often, cover their costs, but regarded them as vitally important loss leaders, with revenue generated to support their publication from other parts of their business. But all kinds of forces are operating in the publishing world which means that such trade-offs are no longer always possible. The advent, too, of digital technologies and social media has had a significant effect on publishing in all areas--print journalism is suffering under the onslaught of freely available internet information, and ebooks have risen in popularity. As John Thompson has said, &amp;quot;Academic publishing has become one of the terrains on which the logics of two different worlds - the world of publishing and the world of the academy - come together and clash, leading on occasion to tension, misunderstanding and mutual recriminations&amp;quot; (Thompson, 2005).

How, in this new world, is the academic of now and the near future to write and circulate their work? How are publishers to respond to the new challenges? How are libraries to curate, preserve, and disseminate the diverse forms and formats coming their way? What economic, political, social and intellectual challenges are we facing in the light of such mandates as the Finch report and HEFCE's recommendations regarding Open Access?
 
At the heart of our enquiries in responding to the research questions posed by the AHRC is the question posed by Jerome McGann in 2010: &amp;quot;What do scholars want?&amp;quot; Whether we work with digital or paper-based resources, or both, our basic needs are the same. We all want our cultural record to be comprehensive, stable, and accessible. And we all want to be able to augment that record with our own contributions.&amp;quot; Traditional print formats and their e-versions are also increasingly limited in representing the breadth of arts and humanities scholarship. New technologies permit new forms of publication more suited to many disciplines: archaeology, art history, anthropology, film studies, paleography and manuscript studies, epigraphy and other areas where the non-textual is at least as important as the textual. But these bring their own problems, for instance, rights to publish images and time-based media, the costs of developing new forms of publication, sustainability. And Open Access still causes fear and suspicion in the minds of many academics (see, for example, the recent piece in the TLS by Jonathan Bate, http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1360491.ece).

There are a number of recent projects and publications seeking to address these questions: in 2011 the Association of American University Presses (AAUP) produced a report, Sustaining Scholarly Publishing: New Business Models for University Presses. In an age of information 'hyperabundance', publishing is within everyone's reach: rather than see this as a threat, however, the Report asserts that &amp;quot;The scholarly enterprise is in it for the long haul, not the next viral hit. As such, the scholarly ecosystem -- libraries, universities, scholarly publishers, scholars -- needs to ensure that the entire ecosystem remains strong over time, and that scholarship is well served by the systems we construct.&amp;quot; These beliefs are at the core of this Project, which seeks to ensure our research is and will be set in robust and coherent communities of practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The core beneficiaries of this research will be professional academics seeking to publish their research and concerned about the long-form scholarly publication. Providing an evidence base of current practice and defining a clear future pathway for the academic book will help scholars to decide the most appropriate form of scholarly discourse. As such this will benefit all researchers - whether early career researchers by ensuring a better understanding of the benefits of the monograph to their academic aspirations, or more senior academics seeking to explore the new opportunities for dissemination of their research offered by digital production processes as these free research from the page. Many subject areas in the arts and humanities are deeply concerned about the future of scholarly publishing, and this Project will enable those somewhat understudied and underrepresented subjects to have their perspectives properly considered and to be consulted on their detailed future needs.

Academics will also benefit from close collaborations with the publishing sector, and intermediaries such as libraries, having a clearer evidence base of workable business models. With better information on future opportunities for the academic book then all parts of the value chain from creator, through publisher and intermediary to consumer can benefit from streamlining of processes, fresh economic models for publishing and consumption, innovative citation options and a clearer path to academic credit and reputation from long-form publications. This in turn will ensure that the general public, who consume many forms of scholarly publication, can benefit from the availability of new books to stimulate knowledge and understanding of arts and humanities subjects.

The Project has a wide and deep process of consultation and engagement built into its structure and methodology. In an area as complex as this, with a diverse, interlocking number of communities of practice in academia, in publishing, and in libraries and other intermediaries then the widest possible community consultation and engagement alongside a number of specifically focused groups and activities is necessary. To achieve this, the Project will establish key relationships with experts, influencers and key actors from the varied communities of practice (linking in professional networks and societies as well as academic societies, research Centres and Institutes, and ensuring engagement and support from across the UK.) These will be invited to join a Community Coalition that will act as both a consultative forum in the first instance and as a means of reaching out to and engaging with the diverse and complex communities of practice. The project will ensure open and equitable consultation and engagement across all the relevant communities.

The Project plan encompasses a range of interventions with the communities of practice to stimulate and provoke debate and enable information gathering. Using expert seminars, high impact keynotes and interviews, a formal consultation process and allowing further investigations from with these communities will allow the beneficiaries to have a direct input and to be directly affected by the project. Wide dissemination of results and active participation are key to ensuring the results of this project provoke change in the professional practices throughout the value chain of scholarly publishing.

Impact will be sought via different media - high visibility platforms such as the THES, the TLS, and The Bookseller, as well as direct interaction via social media feeds, while the opportunity to explore the creation of a new series of books via a new university press at UCL will generate its own reflective research practices.

The report will ask five questions that emerge from these tensions in peer review practices: 
? What are contemporary models of peer review?
? Where does peer review occur in the research and publication process?
? What is the role of peer review in institutional structures (e.g. individual HEIs, REF, HEFCE/SFC, RCUK)?
? How are reviewers guided towards writing useful feedback? 
? What could peer review look like in the future?
In order to address the first question, the report will conduct a literature review of contemporary models of peer review of books and journals in the arts and humanities. While the focus of the report will be on the arts and humanities, the project will also assess peer review models that gained traction in STEM publishing but have not been applied in mainstream humanities academic publishing. The second question will be addressed through a literature review of the role of peer review in the development of academic work. For example, when does the peer review take place in the production of a book? Does it occur multiple times? The third question will summarise documentation relating to the institutional roles of peer review. The report will also summarise documentation provided by publishers for the purpose of peer review and external guidelines such as the Committee of Publishing Ethic's (COPE) Ethical Guidelines for Peer Review to answer the final question.
It is intended that the Peer Review project will conclude with a set of recommendations for further primary research. The project will connect to the Scottish Graduate School for Arts &amp;amp; Humanities (SGSAH) development of doctoral training workshops in 2016 on the topics of peer review &amp;amp; reviewing, open access, IP &amp;amp; copyright.

This project considers the possibilities for the Academic Book of the Future in the context of the digital age, aiming to challenge and expand current perceptions and to lay the groundwork for a wider view of what might be acceptable as book format for, eg, REF purposes (2026 and beyond). 

It builds on debates that were initiated at the first Impossible Constellation event hosted by the College of Arts at Lincoln, July 2014, which served as a showcase for a wide range of forms of outputs that were suitable for those working in media and the arts. Thus it would be particularly suitable to a UoL setting given that it would play on existing skills and strengths of College of Arts with its focus on interdisciplinary work across humanities, media, the arts and new technologies.

The symposium, with speakers engaged in the commissioning, publishing, creating, archiving and housing new types of 'book/publication', would be embedded within the programme for the third edition of the Frequency Festival of Digital Culture (23 Oct-1st Nov 2015), a partnership event that involves the University plus a range of city organisations and which receives support from the Arts Council, Foyle Foundation and local authorities. Guests will include Catherine Grant (as keynote) to speak about the video essay, and projects exhibited will include examples of 'practice-as-research' developed at Lincoln. Participants will be invited to explore the Festival which will feature a special projection mapping event at Lincoln Castle as part of the Magna Carta 800 anniversary celebrations.

The book jam/hack will be hosted and organised by our co_LAB research group, which specialises in cross-disciplinary projects involving staff, students and guests, that test the possibilities for using new technologies to explore specific themes. The aim would be to produce the foundations for a digital multi-authored publication in a week which showcases a live research project at Lincoln.

In short, the events would seek to challenge:
- what it means to create, publish and house/archive a book in digital age: open to new forms of publishing beyond the traditional text;
- what it means to be an 'author' in an age of increasing digital collaboration and revision;
-what it means to be a 'reader' of the academic book in the digital age
- the idea of the 'book' itself in this environment.

? Project format: Symposium (including screening/s and other digital formats), to be held as part of the third edition of Frequency Festival of Digital Culture, followed by a book jam/hack to produce a collaborative multi-authored digital book in a week

? Outputs: Symposium - papers, report and recording. Possible submission to REFRAME, an open access academic digital platform for the online practice, publication and curation of internationally produced research and scholarship.

Contemporary discourses about the benefits and problems of open access, digital books, e-reading, and intellectual property rarely situate these debates in cultural contexts of communities of readers and scholars and other communities of practice. Bringing together international scholars who use ethnographic approaches to explore both the representation of anthropological knowledge and its forms of circulation, we seek to explore the follow questions: How do different forms of our research move through the world? How and in what ways are these shared, translated, interpreted, reworked and revised as they circulate? How does the possibility of digitization shape these practices? What are the ethics of knowledge production? What do readers want? What are the differences between images, text, audio-visual media, and other data in digital spaces? A particular strength of the symposium will be a shared focus upon the importance of visual and material culture in ethnographic research, including reflections upon the role of the archive, alongside the monograph. The workshop will take the form of a morning of 20 minute presentations. In the afternoon we will work together to draft a working document to provide a set of ethical guidelines for thinking about the future of the book expanding our terms of reference around the global circulation of academic material. It is our hope that we could create a resource that brings current policies into dialogue with different cultural perspectives and different academic practices that is also sensitive to the particularities of different media.

For the first time, booksellers, institutions, publishers, librarians, authors and readers came together to debate and bring to life the academic book in a series of coordinated events, competitions, promotions, and social media activity.

Academic Book Week took place from 9-16 November 2015, all over the UK and beyond.

#AcBookWeek was the centrepiece of 2015 activity on the two-year AHRC/British Library The Academic Book of the Future Project, as well as the launchpad for 2016's Project activity.

The week was a huge success, with over 60 events taking place up and down the country as well as internationally, including seminars, workshops, debates, symposia, exhibitions (both physical and virtual), writing sprints, competitions, promotions, offers and more!
