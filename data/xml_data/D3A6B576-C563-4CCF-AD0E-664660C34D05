Recent advances in genomic technologies have resulted in the generation of a vast array of &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; that needs to be deciphered to increase our knowledge of CRC and use this information to develop new clinical tests and therapies. Using this information can allow us to assign patients into different groups (a process known as stratification) such that we can then select which patients will respond best to which therapies, while also avoiding potential side effects. Unfortunately, the majority of attempts to stratify patients using this &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; have been largely unsuccessful to date. One of the major bottlenecks is the lack of an intuitive, flexible and yet powerful analysis platform which permits scientists and clinicians to test the data. 
We intend to develop a robust, secure and safe framework at Queen's University Belfast which can house many data types received from the research laboratory, from the pathology laboratory, from the clinician and from the patient. Typically, processing, visualising and analysing these big data profiles require comprehensive training in computer programming. As a result, analysing big data is often considered a daunting and lengthy task. We intend to simplify and accelerate this process by constructing an easy-access ever-growing archive of gold standard, novel and CRC-specific data analytic applications (apps) to embed within a bespoke analysis framework which can be tailored to suit the individual user's needs. 
Through collaborations already established by Professor Mark Lawler between UK and European partners such as the Stratification of ColoRecTal cancer (S:CORT) consortium, we will showcase the capabilities of our accelerative analysis framework. The S:CORT consortium has generated comprehensive datasets from large retrospective and clinical trial cohorts to address major areas of unmet clinical need. We will use our platform to interrogate these datasets in order to develop new tests that predict which patients will respond to different treatments including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.
We hypothesise that our big data framework will empower cancer researchers to independently interrogate their own datasets in real time. This will lead to the more efficient use of resources, to help drive advances in CRC diagnosis and prediction of response to different treatments. Finally, our long-term aim is to develop this framework so that the apps created can be used to access the data underneath in a cancer agnostic context.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>One of the major bottlenecks in achieving precision medicine in colorectal cancer (CRC) is the lack of an intuitive yet powerful analysis platform which permits scientists and clinicians to independently interrogate their own datasets. Our framework will be a CRC-specific web platform that allows the integrated analysis of multi-omics data (e.g. DNA sequencing, transcriptomics and methylation) with clinical/pathological data through a RESTful Application programming interface (API) coupled with dynamic data visualisation functionalities. The framework will be polyglot persistent and facilitates the merging of both SQL and Non-SQL database management systems (DBMS).
The frameworks core will implement a 'plug and play' architecture which is built to act as an umbrella for multiple loosely coupled and highly cohesive statistical application modules (apps), each of which can be built and customised to address different analytical needs using well established statistical programming languages (e.g. R, Python). The apps available within the framework will be wide ranging and consist of many of the gold standard techniques used for data processing, visualisation and feature selection. This pipeline will help identify molecular subtypes, robust gene expression signatures, map important biological pathways and perform in silico pathology characterisation within proprietary and publically available CRC patient data cohorts.
The Stratification of ColoRecTal cancer (S:CORT) consortium has generated comprehensive datasets from large retrospective and clinical trial cohorts (e.g. - MRC FOCUS). In collaboration with partners, such as S:CORT, we will use our platform to interrogate these datasets in order to develop new tests that predict which patients will respond to different treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. Finally, our framework will maintain a highly flexible and scalable design structure to permit cancer-agnostic analysis in future projects.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>279158</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/S003789/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
