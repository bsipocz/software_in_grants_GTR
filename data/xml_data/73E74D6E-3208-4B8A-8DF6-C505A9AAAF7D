The introduction of these concepts is owed to the Ancient Greeks, who distinguished the many just acts (particulars) from justice itself (the 'one-over-many', the universal). Whilst there are family connections-our concepts are the descendants of theirs-the use they made of them differs from our own. But even during recent history the concepts of particular and universal have undergone substantial transformations. 
 On the Genealogy of Universals seeks to overcome our sense of over-familiarity with these concepts by developing a case study of their evolution during the period 1899 to 1925, a study that shows how the concepts of particular and universal were initially countenanced, transfigured and subsequently given up by the early analytic philosophers. Once it is recognised that their employment of these concepts arose out of the specific theoretical situation in which they found themselves-as opposed to being an atemporal, context independent given-we can raise the question whether the concepts of particular and universal serve the needs of analytic metaphysics now.
 Why a study of this exact period? It is one of profound philosophico-historical significance, a period bounded at one end by the birthdate of analytic metaphysics itself, the year in which Moore's &amp;quot;The Nature of Judgement&amp;quot; and Russell's The Philosophy of Leibniz were published. It is a remarkable fact about these works that despite their realism and identification of &amp;quot;sound philosophy&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;the analysis of concepts&amp;quot;, the particular-universal distinction, part of the ABC of contemporary analytic metaphysics, is absent from them. It is also this period that is bounded at the other end by Ramsey's &amp;quot;Universals&amp;quot;, a beguiling work in which Ramsey came to the conclusion that there was no particular-universal distinction, the theory of universals being merely &amp;quot;a great muddle&amp;quot;. But between these dates the concepts of particular and universal enjoyed another heyday, perhaps in this respect upon a level with Ancient Greece, press-ganged by Moore, Russell and Wittgenstein to provide, roughly speaking, the organs and connecting tissues of propositions (understood as unified metaphysical bodies); and because of this perceived link between them, the concepts of particular and universal transformed as our heroes' conceptions of propositions and truth advanced ventre &amp;agrave; terre.
 On the Genealogy of Universals aims to liberate our thinking about particulars and universals by providing a historical reconstruction of the debate about universals that blazed during this period of intense philosophical activity. Doing so requires us not only to pay heed to the famous writings of Russell, Wittgenstein and Ramsey but also to the intriguing works of a number of metaphysically minded philosophers whose contributions, received as important at the time, have subsequently been neglected: Stout, Johnson, Moore, McTaggart and Whitehead. It is especially glaring that Whitehead's contribution is left unsung. For Whitehead, the particular-universal distinction was just a piece of Weltanschauung, a fragment of a Newtonian mindset that prevents our developing a metaphysics of science adequate to the diversity nature exhibits, instead of seeking to straitjacket what exists into a too simple-minded division between particulars and universals. Once we have understood the contributions made by these different interlocutors we are better placed to understand the rise and fall of the particular-universal distinction, and better equipped to understand the great works of our early analytic heroes, and determine whether these concepts we have inherited are still of use to us.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I do not envisage that the research I propose to conduct will impact directly upon users and beneficiaries outside the academic research community. Nonetheless I do envisage that the work I undertake, alongside the works of other contemporary philosophers, will impact indirectly upon the wider community. In his Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, David Hume, the great enlightenment philosopher, wrote, &amp;quot;though a philosopher may live remote from business, the genius of philosophy, if carefully cultivated by several, must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society, and bestow a similar correctness on every art and calling.' (Sect. 1, 5). What Hume said in the eighteenth century is no less true in the twenty-first. Theoretical philosophy impacts upon science and mathematics, practical philosophy upon politics and applied ethics, and thence upon society more generally. But one should not loose sight of the fact, that individuals outside academia also often benefit more immediately from the sheer intellectual delight of engaging with the ideas of philosophers and thereby satisfying their native desire to understand. In this way, philosophy contributes to the intellectual well-being of society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22658</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture on the Nature of Analytic Philosophy, University of Glasgow</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F6FA0AC-88E6-448D-A284-AB13FBFA54F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The lecture gave rise to discussion with members of the public, and academics working outside my field in law and physics.

As I explained in my &amp;quot;Pathways to Impact&amp;quot; the intention of the project was to undertake a piece of scholarship in the history of philosophy, which is not directly relevant to the world outside academia, but that by writing something that would be useful to other philosophers, historians of philosophy and historians of ideas, a contribution would be made to a community that collectively had an impact, albeit in ways that cannot be predicted in advance.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6155D820-5786-4190-8DF4-2A2699597218</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5460e7b801fa77.38262171</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main outcome of the project is a monograph, On the Genealogy of Universals, a ground-breaking study of the origins of analytic philosophy, a species of philosophy that endures to the present day but emerged in a distinctive form at the end of the 19th century. Two of the prime movers in this development were G.E. Moore (1873-1958) and Bertrand Russell (1872-1970). Although both of them had been thoroughly immersed in the bathtub of British idealism, the summer of 1898 marked a distinctive break for Moore and Russell, when they turned away from Kant and Hegel, in their, until recently, unpublished works, The Metaphysical Basis of Ethics and The Analysis of Mathematical Reasoning. On the Genealogy of Universals sheds new and much needed light upon this critical period, between 1897 and 1901, which has hitherto baffled and perplexed philosophers and historians of philosophy.

The received view of the metaphysical position that Moore advanced in 1898 was that his writings either verged on the incoherent, were jejune or too obscure to merit in-depth investigation. But when interpreted against the backdrop of Moore and Russell's engagement with Kant's critical philosophy, specifically the Metaphysical Deduction of the Categories, the otherwise mysterious pieces of the jigsaw fall into place. As a consequence, On the Genealogy of Universals provides the first commentary on this early period of analytic philosophy that makes sense of the early moves that Moore and Russell made. From this platform, the monograph proceeds to trace the previously hidden metaphysical path that analytic philosophy took through the neglected works of Whitehead and Stout to the conversations that Wittgenstein held with the Vienna Circle in the 1920s. Another upshot of this research was a novel understanding of the Russell-Wittgenstein debate about the nature of judgment, which turns the usual understanding of the debate on its head, which I have also published.

Key research questions which are opened up as a consequence of this research include (1) the role and the significance of the metaphysics of relations, which I have explored in a further published article and aim to investigate further in monograph form and (2) the need for a broader understanding of the intellectual environment from which analytic philosophy, in reaction, emerged. The latter requires an understanding of the preceding generation of English speaking idealists, especially in Scotland, and the way that their ideas were superseded by developments not only in philosophy, but mathematics and classics, the latter two being the disciplines from which Moore and Russell emerged. 

As a consequence of this work, I have established liaisons with philosophers working on the history of analytic philosophy not only in the U.K., but in Ireland, Switzerland and Canada, where I will shortly be visiting the Bertrand Russell Archive in McMaster University as the Visiting Bertrand Russell Professor to look further at his early manuscripts and correspondence. I have also begun to make contacts with classicists and 19th century historians to come to a fuller understanding of the context in which analytic philosophy emerged.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In my 'Pathways to Impact' statement I wrote that &amp;quot;I do not envisage that the research I propose to conduct will impact directly upon users and beneficiaries outside the academic research community.
