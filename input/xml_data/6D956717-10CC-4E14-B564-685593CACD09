One revolutionary development that has taken place over the last forty years is the advent of DNA sequencing. We now have the ability to decipher the genome sequence (or 'genetic blueprint') of any organism, and from this work out how they tick. About five years ago, this genomics revolution stepped up a gear, with the introduction of DNA sequencing technologies that increased the rate of genome sequencing, and reduced the cost, many, many fold. These 'next generation' technologies have suddenly made it possible for many researchers to start using genome sequencing in their work. However, as with any new technology, new solutions bring new problems. In the case of genome sequencing it is a 'rich person's' problem: researchers now can generate hundreds to thousands of times as much data as they used to, in a small fraction of the time, but they do not have the computer tools to process and understand it. The reduced cost of sequencing also means that many researchers who now can afford to use this technology do not have the long training required in computing to successfully analyse the floods of data. We propose to develop a set of easy-to-use tools, which we call NextGenPartiGene, using 'next generation' computing frameworks, that will alleviate this problem. We are focussing on the problem of working out what genes an organism is using (or 'expressing'), and what it is that these genes are likely to be doing. By sampling only the expressed genes of an organism (or a part of an organism, such as a leaf or a particular tissue type) it is possible to build up a detailed picture of the kinds of biochemical pathways the organism is running (what it can eat and what wastes it produces), and how experimental interventions change these pathways. We will build the NextGenPartiGene toolkit using an emerging model for such projects: the idea that much of the hard work is done by a server computer, running clever programmes behind the scenes, and that this server is driven by a client, accessed through a standard web browser. By building this client-server toolkit, we will be able to guide researchers with vast amounts of next-generation sequencing data down the best-practice, tried-and-tested paths to full and fruitful analysis. This means they will be able to extract maximum information from their data, and maximum value from their research funding. We will release the NextGenPartiGene tools as open-access software, so that others are both free to use it, and free to modify and improve it to fit their needs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Next generation sequencing technologies have qualitatively changed the way we acquire and analyse transcriptomes by making it possible to generate vast amounts of sequence data very cheaply. As the sequencing effort required to generate transcriptome-scale data has decreased, the bioinformatics effort required to analyse and annotate them has grown proportionally bigger. The combined effects of increased affordability of sequencing and decentralization of sequencing facilities means that the bulk of the burden of analysis falls on researchers who are not bioinformatics specialists. These conditions create a need for a user-friendly, robust transcriptome analysis package that can handle the volume of data produced by next-gen technologies. Our existing transcriptomics pipeline, PartiGene, is designed for last-generation sequencing technologies and written using last-generation programming techniques. We propose to develop and release a complete replacement, NextGenPartiGene, which will be built on modern programming technology and will incorporate best-practice transcriptome analysis. NextGenPartiGene will run completely within a web browser, allowing data sharing to be built in as a core feature, and will combine third party applications (for assembly and annotation) with custom visualization tools to provide a complete transcriptomics analysis and data mining workflow. NextGenPartiGene will be built using the Grails web framework, allowing rapid development and straightforward deployment and where possible will use parallelization to take advantage of multiple processor cores and speed up analysis. The database schema will be designed from scratch to cope with the expected volumes of data, and will take advantage of the full-text indexing integrated in postgreSQL 8.3 to offer comprehensive searching of annotations.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>NextGenPartiGene is envisaged as an enabling tool. The beneficiaries of this research will be mainly, in the first instance, academics and small to medium enterprise companies using next generation sequencing approaches in the analysis of novel species or novel treatments of well-studied species. By building efficient, fit-for-purpose and open-access tools, we will promote best practice across the field. As we are releasing the software openly, it will not impact in terms of direct financial (i.e. intellectual property rights) benefit to ourselves or to the University, but it will facilitate the exploitation of these tools by such users. By taking the weight of construction and testing of usable software we release such beneficiaries to better produce the outcomes they are qualified to, be they improved biological understanding, or better exploitation of a biological or biotechnological resource. In particular, the need for discovery, development and testing of new crop organisms, whether they are animals, plants, fungi or other eukaryotes, for goals of biofuels production, ecological remediation and food security assurance, will be aided by more efficient and trustworthy bioinformatics tools. Genomics and transcriptomics are now a first port of call in development of novel organisms for exploitation, whether to understand their basic biology and biochemistry, to unravel the mechanisms behind desirable traits, or to develop of genetic markers for assisted breeding programmes. NextGenPartiGene can be a key resource in achieving these goals. In particular, by reducing the time and resource needed to turn raw data into mineable databases, it will increase the effciency and productivity of next generation transcriptomics approaches across the board. Our tools will also promote data sharing between users, thus giving them enhanced ability to fruitfully cooperate on shared projects. By offering a unified solution, collaborating institutions and organisations and companies can either open their analyses (via the open API of the NextGenPartiGene suite) or the web browser to outside scrutiny, or simply merge datasets produced independently (because the underlying data structure will be the same).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>123949</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Blaxter lab collaborated closely wth artists-in-residence (see http://www.ascus.org.uk/ciie-micro-residency-artists-announced/) in the Centre for immunity Infection and Evolution to inspire and be part of the final exhibition &amp;quot;Transmissions&amp;quot;.

Nematode parasites are of major importance in human health and agriculture, and free-living species deliver essential ecosystem services. The genomics revolution has resulted in the production of many small datasets of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a phylogenetically wide range of nematode species, but these are not easily compared. NEMBASE4 presents a single portal onto extensively functionally annotated transcriptomes from over sixty species of nematodes, including plant and animal parasites and free-living taxa. Using the PartiGene suite of tools, we have assembled the ESTs publicly available for each species into a high-quality set of putative transcripts. These transcripts have been translated to produce a protein sequence resource, and each annotated with functional information derived from comparison to well-studied nematode species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and also other non-nematode resources. By cross-comparing the sequences within NEMBASE4, we have also generated a protein family assignment for each translation. The data are presented in an openly-accessible, interactive database. We have used NEMBASE4 to examine the uniqueness of the transcriptomes of major clades of parasitic nematodes, identifying lineage-restricted genes that may underpin particular parasitic phenotypes, and identify nematode-unique protein families that may be developed as drug targets.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F50E93C-7ED5-433E-91AC-8265C288720B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NEMBASE gene models and analyses are exported widely to other analysis groups including WORMBASE and Nematode.net</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460df3c93d706.54024688</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>NEMBASE4</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nematodes.org/nembase4/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Background
Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies have made it possible to generate transcriptome data for novel organisms quickly and cheaply, to the extent that the effort required to annotate and publish a new transcriptome is greater than the effort required to sequence it. Often, following publication, details of the annotation effort are only available in summary form, hindering subsequent exploitation of the data. To promote best-practice in annotation and to ensure that data remain accessible, we have written afterParty, a web application that allows users to assemble, annotate and publish novel transcriptomes using only a web browser.
Results
afterParty is a robust web application that implements best-practice transcriptome assembly, annotation, browsing, searching, and visualization. Users can turn a collection of reads (from Roche 454 chemistry) or assembled contigs (from any sequencing chemistry, including Illumina Solexa RNA-Seq) into a searchable, browsable transcriptome resource and quickly make it publicly available. Contigs are functionally annotated based on similarity to known sequences and protein domains. Once assembled and annotated, transcriptomes derived from multiple species or libraries can be compared and searched. afterParty datasets can either be created using the existing afterParty server, or using local instances that can be easily built using a virtual machine. afterParty includes powerful visualization tools for transcriptome dataset exploration and uses a flexible annotation architecture which will allow additional types of annotation to be added in the future.
Conclusions
afterParty's main use case scenario is one in which a working biologist has generated a large volume of transcribed sequence data and wishes to turn it into a useful resource that has some durability. By reducing the effort, bioinformatics skills, and computational resources needed to annotate and publish a transcriptome, afterParty will facilitate the annotation and sharing of sequence data that would otherwise remain unavailable. A typical metazoan transcriptome containing several tens of thousands of contigs can be annotated in a few minutes of interactive time and a few days of computational time.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5251D513-90D0-48D3-84E1-19373859458F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>AfterParty now has a community of users worldwide.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460dd8951cf15.16610348</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>AfterParty transcriptome analysis tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://afterparty.bio.ed.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Summary: High quality draft genomes are now easy to generate, as sequencing and assembly costs have dropped dramatically.

This democratisation of access to large-scale data has allowed many research teams to plan to assemble the genomes of non-model organisms. These new genome targets are very different from the traditional, inbred, laboratory reared model organisms. They are often small, and cannot be isolated free of their environment - whether ingested food, the surrounding host organism of parasites, or commensal and symbiotic organisms attached to or within the individuals sampled. Preparation of pure DNA originating from a single species can be technically impossible, but assembly of mixed-organism DNA can be difficult, as most genome assemblers perform poorly when faced with multiple genomes in different stoichiometries. This class of problem is common in metagenomic datasets that deliberately try to capture all the genomes present in an environment, but replicon assembly is not often the goal of such programmes. Here we present an approach to extracting from mixed DNA sequence data subsets that correspond to single species' genomes and thus improving genome assembly. We use both numerical (proportion of GC bases and read coverage) and biological (best-matching sequence in annotated databases) indicators to aid partitioning of draft assembly contigs, and the reads that contribute to those contigs, into distinct bins that can then be subjected to rigorous, optimised assembly. We also present a tool, blobsplorer, that aids exploration and selection of subsets from GC/coverage/taxonomy annotated datasets.
