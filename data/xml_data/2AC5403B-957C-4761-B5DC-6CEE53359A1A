Sometimes cell division goes wrong and cells are made that divide uncontrollably, producing cancerous tumours. We are trying to understand cells manage to avoid this.

For cells to divide correctly, they must copy their DNA and then separate each copy to opposite sides of the cell, so that when the cell divides into two, each new cell inherits one single copy of the DNA. The copied DNA is pulled apart by molecular &amp;quot;fibres&amp;quot; known as microtubules, and these fibres are formed by spherical objects known as centrosomes. The fibres reach out from one of two centrosomes positioned either side of the DNA and then attach and pull the copied DNA apart.

Importantly, each daughter cell inherits only one centrosome, but needs two to be able to divide again. Thus, the centrosome must duplicate itself and this duplication process must not go wrong, as producing too many centrosomes can lead to problems when the cell tries to separate the duplicated DNA, and this may lead to cancer. 

Our key aim is to understand how centrosome duplication is properly controlled. Centrosomes are composed of a pair of cylindrical-shaped structures known as centrioles. During centrosome duplication, these centrioles split apart to produce two new centrosomes. To ensure that this can happen in the following cell cycle, each centriole must produce a new &amp;quot;daughter&amp;quot; centriole, resulting in a new pair of mother and daughter centrioles in each centrosome. Although under normal conditions only one new daughter centriole is produced during this process, it is possible that multiple daughter centrioles can form on a single mother centriole, and this ultimately results in too many centrosomes being made. 

Within the cell, centrosomes are tightly associated with a membrane that surrounds the DNA, known as the nuclear envelope. Unexpectedly, we have recently found that daughter centrioles tend to form on the side the mother centriole that faces the nuclear envelope, and when we artificially detach the centrosomes from the nuclear envelope the position of daughter centriole assembly on the mother is randomised. We want to investigate if the local environment between the mother centriole and the nuclear envelope drives daughter centriole assembly. We predict that this may help ensure that one and only one new daughter assembles during each centriole duplication event.

We will test this using fruit flies as a model system, as we can easily manipulate their genome to create the ideal conditions for our experiments. Most of the genes in the fly are similar to our own and the process of centriole duplication is very similar in flies and humans. Therefore, what we discover in the fly will be of great importance to understanding human health and disease. We have also established a collaboration with a lab who works with human cell lines, and we will use the information we learn from the fly to investigate how cellular structures such as the nuclear envelope may influence and help control centriole duplication in human cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Centrosomes contain a pair of barrel-shaped centrioles that duplicate once each cell cycle. Centrosomes duplicate when the centrioles split apart and act as &amp;quot;mothers&amp;quot; to template the formation of a single new &amp;quot;daughter centriole&amp;quot;. This process involves a limited number of well conserved proteins and must be tightly controlled; mis-regulation can lead to multiple daughter centrioles growing from each mother, leading to centrosome amplification and possibly cancer. We aim to understand how cells ensure that one and only one daughter centriole is formed during each centriole duplication event.

Centrioles are very small, typically ~100-150nm long in Drosophila. Nevertheless, we have developed a method that can estimate the position of mother and daughter centrioles within a pair using standard confocal light microscopy. We have used this new method to examine if the position of daughter centriole growth is predefined or random. Strikingly, we have found that daughter centrioles tend to assemble on the side of the mother centriole facing the nuclear envelope, and that when we induce centrosomes to detach from the nuclear envelope the position of daughter centriole assembly is randomised.

Our hypothesis is that the local environment between the mother centriole and nuclear envelope is favourable for daughter centriole assembly and therefore may help limit centriole production to only one side of the mother centriole. We will test this hypothesis by examining whether centrosome detachment promotes under- or over-centriole duplication and explore the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ability of the nuclear envelope to influence centriole duplication. This project will run in parallel to a collaborative project that will investigate the position of daughter centriole assembly in human cells. Our work should open up a new area of investigation that involves understanding how non-centrosomal structures can influence centriole duplication.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from this research?

This work has long-term health implications that will benefit patients with diseases linked to centrosome defects, including cancer sufferers and patients with primary autosomal recessive microcephaly (MPCH) and primordial dwarfism (PD). Cancer cells often contain too many centrosomes and it is believed that this may contribute towards the cell's ability to be cancerous (by both increasing the chance of chromosomes segregation errors during cell division and by increasing the cell's ability to invade neighbouring tissue (known as metastasis)). Although it remains unclear how centrosome defects are linked to MPCH and PD, we know that these patients often carry mutations in centrosomal genes, including the genes required for centriole duplication. It is therefore extremely important for fundamental biological research to establish the cellular mechanisms that govern the process of centrosome duplication, particularly how cells maintain correct centrosome numbers through successive cell divisions. 


How might they benefit?

Outcomes from the proposed research will help provide a fundamental understanding of centrosome biology and will impact how other researchers around the world conduct their research. The mechanisms of centriole duplication are well conserved between species and our work with fruit flies will directly apply to our collaborative project with Dr. Akhmanova that aims to understand how centriole duplication is regulated in mammalian cells. We anticipate that our results will provide crucial mechanistic insight into how centrosome numbers are regulated and this information can be used to help us better understand, and potentially treat, human disease, in particular by providing pharmaceutical companies with potential drug targets. 


What will be done to maximise the impact of the research?

We will publish our work in well-renowned peer reviewed journals and ensure that the papers are &amp;quot;open access&amp;quot;, meaning that they can be read by anyone (without needing a paid subscription to the journal). We also aim to publish the work in non-for-profit journals so that the BBSRC's money will filter back into science. We will publicise the work on our website, social media, the press office of the University of Cambridge, the Cambridge Science Festival and the BBSRC media offices, and will give talks to local schools and to non-specialist adult audiences in order to inspire the next generation of scientists. 


Professional development of staff.

The post-doc and technician employed on this grant will learn many new skills that will be invaluable for their scientific careers. These will include molecular biology, fly husbandry, microscopy, proteomics and biochemistry. They will also have many opportunities to present their work both within the department and at international conferences, fostering their oral communication and presentation skills. They will have access to the Universities Career Service, which will help guide them in their future pursuits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>446767</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P019188/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D3FE6EA5-4508-4525-8DA5-4D78DF7F3BAC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell cycle</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D16FDB98-8CBA-4298-8ACD-955DF734E7F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cells</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DA052B9-38AC-4F23-88FA-66C8DEB08B81</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organelles &amp; components</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
