The incidence of tuberculosis in cattle has increased progressively over the last 25 years despite annual testing of cattle herds to identify and slaughter infected animals. The European badger is recognised as a reservoir host for the causal agent Mycobacterium bovis. Culling policies involving removal of badgers from TB-affected farms, were deployed in the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to control the disease in cattle, but had little if any impact on the problem. This led, in 1998, to the initiation of a National Badger Culling Trial, to test the effect of different culling protocols on the incidence of cattle TB and on the transmission dynamics of infection in culled areas. An Independent Scientific Group (of which WIM was a member) oversaw the design and implementation of the trial and analysed the results, which were published in a number of refereed publications and in a final report (2007). The group produced clear scientific evidence that badger culling has major shortcomings and is unlikely to offer a sustainable, cost-effective strategy for reducing incidence of TB in cattle. This has resulted in a substantial &amp;quot;re-think&amp;quot; on policy options, allowing allocation of resources to measures that are more likely to be effective; development of badger TB vaccination strategies and application of improved diagnostic tests in cattle herd testing.
Parallel studies within The Roslin Institute have addressed the question of whether there is any evidence of heritable genetic resistance to TB that might form the basis for an effective selection strategy. The detection of such variation, which involved significant advances in the underlying theoretical framework, has now been translated into a genome-wide association analysis in the UK dairy herd, with the rapid implementation of estimation of breeding values amongst peak dairy sires to reduce the prevalence of susceptible animals. This research has strong potential to inform studies of resistance to other prevalent diseases, including human tuberculosis.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1184A4F8-89E1-47E1-A4FB-6823D329DF13</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e01b4a68a874.57143237</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Analyses of statutory data on cases of TB in cattle, along with matched cattle pedigree data, have provided evidence that resistance to TB infection is heritable, with some sires producing particularly
susceptible daughters. This has formed the basis of a large-scale genome scan for TB resistance, using a 60k bovine SNP array, to explore opportunities to breed for increased resistance to disease. - A QTL that is a major determinant of the ability of Streptococcus pyogenes to induce macrophage cell death and disease has been identified on mouse chromosome 17. Fine mapping with SNP markers has reduced the QTL interval to a 9 Mb genomic region, which is being further resolved by mapping and phenotypic analyses of several sub-congenic mouse lines. - A genome scan for association with haematological and immunological traits has been completed in commercial pigs using a sparse (5k) SNP chip. Significant associations of several immune parameters with clusters of SNPs in chromosomal regions containing plausible candidate genes have been identified. Independent confirmation of these findings would open the possibility to use marker-assisted selection to improve pig innate immune responses and, consequently, pig health and performance</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Use of genetic markers to select for enhanced disease resistance to disease.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FCCBF068-EB79-4131-A271-CE31C22A8E7C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0527e538755.99470446</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/D/05201237</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
