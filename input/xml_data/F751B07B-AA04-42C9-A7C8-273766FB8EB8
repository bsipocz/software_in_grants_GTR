&lt;p>Phase 1 of the research (2012-13) will involve developing increased provision for quantitative teaching through a shared curriculum at 3 pioneer universities (Bath, Bedfordshire and Queen's Belfast). The curriculum consists of 10 ?sessions? focused on quantitative research within social work, starting with the need for numbers through to basic statistics. In addition, resources for more advanced study will be provided. Each session will include resources for teaching, references and interactive materials to support teaching and learning but aimed at allowing flexible use across different types of course.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Phase 2 will involve rolling this out to other interested Universities (2013-15). An evaluation will compare knowledge and views of students and staff, after the first year and at the end of the project. This work is complemented by the RDI proposal aimed at teaching and pedagogic support.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Social work is the lead discipline in the field of social care. UK expenditure on social care is in excess of &amp;pound;20 billion per year, with around 1.5 million people employed in the sector and more than 3 million receiving social care services. Social workers provide a particularly significant element of the workforce in this area as they tend to have managerial and budgetary control. Furthermore, a significant amount of social care research is led by or involves social work researchers. The current proposal therefore has the potential to have a significant positive impact beyond its capacity to provide for better educated social work researchers. 
The proposals would lead to an increase in the number of social work practitioners who are quantitatively literate. This will contribute to social work practitioners having a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to research. It is particularly important for understanding research relating to what does or does not work in social work. It is also to be hoped that as these practitioners progress in their careers and move into senior professional and management positions their improved understanding of quantitative research designs and methodologies will allow them to be more discerning users of and commissioners of research. 
In the medium to long term the proposal is intended to provide more and better quality quantitative research within social work. This is particularly likely to increase the field of evaluative research. Research has suggested that by far the most common questions that social workers want answered related to what works, but that less than 4% of research studies address such questions. A project on this scale would not on its own address such a significant structural issue, but it would contribute to developing more researchers able to address such questions. In the long term it it hoped that such a body of research would benefit social workers (in that they would have a more robust evidence base for their nterventions) and the people who use social work services.
The paths to such longer term impacts are complex. The proposed project would lead to more quantitatively literate social work graduates from the pioneer universities. This alone is not an insignificant impact, with more than 200 graduates per year from the 3 pioneer sites. More generally it is hoped that given the current appetite within the social work academic community for action to address the lack of quantitative research capacity there will be a high use of the online resources and materials produced within the project. However, given the already ambitious aims of the project and the limited funding available it has been necessary to focus much of the activity to ensure more widespread impact on the accompanying RDI proposal. This is specifically aimed at taking learning from the current project and rolling it out for a national audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>70754</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This was not a research study but a project to develop the skills and confidence of social work academics in teaching quantitative research.

The following products or activities were delivered as part of this grant:

- A core curriculum of 10 lectures (a standard module) was developed and delivered at the 3 pioneer universities (Bath, Bedfordshire and Queen's Belfast)
- This was shared as a website for all social work academics who might be interested to use
- In addition, further supplementary material for more advanced study was produced and shared with a particular focus on students who might be interested in a quantitative research study for an end of course project or dissertation
- In each of the pioneers a training day was provided for all staff, and mentoring and support was provided for those staff delivering the programme
- An additional statistics course and final conference were provided
- The team presented and shared the resources in a keynote presentation for the main conference for social work educators.
- An evaluation was carried out and will be published - this identified very low levels of staff confidence and knowledge of statistics across a range of universities, and established that the course increased students' belief in the importance of quantitative research, their understanding of research design but had little impact on their statistical understanding</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The materials are being used in part or wholly across 13 universities. Further details on this are provided in the companion grant report (ES/J011754/1).

The materials can be accessed here : http://www.beds.ac.uk/mswc (unfortunately the ResearchFish website seemed to believe this was not a valid link).

In summary, the module is being delivered in whole or almost as a whole across 11 universities. As a result it is impacting on c.600 students per year. In addition, some elements of the teaching resources are being used in 7 or more other universities to our knowledge.

In addition to undergraduate provision many of the universities are also using the courses for post-graduate teaching.

We are finishing a book written to support such teaching (publication due early 2016) and we hope that this will provide a valuable additional support for teaching in this area. One of our persistent findings is that a high proportion of social work academics lack confidence in teaching in this area and we therefore feel an accompanying textbook is likely to increase the confidence of both teachers and students.

A number of additional activities were carried out to support the roll-out of the curriculum as set out in the report for the partner grant.

While the project has been completed with a high degree of success, a constant dilemma was identifying the best level to pitch teaching. Ultimately our focus was on (1) the need for quantitative approaches (2) quantitative research design and (3) underlying statistical concepts. We found that when we went beyond these relatively basic areas - for instance considering specific statistical concepts - there was a strong sense from most academic staff that this was &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot;. As a result the overall programme was wide but shallow: it has succeeded in introducing basic quantitative understandings to a large number of staff and students, but this would need to be supplemented by further input for these students to blossom into researchers comfortable using quantitative research methods. Our next challenge in the discipline of social work is perhaps to support a smaller cadre of academics in developing a higher level of quantitative skill. However, having provided a good foundation for a wider number is likely to be helpful in such an endeavour.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>380FFE4E-B703-4AF8-8F8B-8BABE0545693</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>559a4ff1347425.81740473</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CAEA21AD-433A-425D-86EF-D8A07F2DE6B3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Making Social Work Count: A Curriculum Innovation to Teach Quantitative Research Methods and Statistical Analysis to Undergraduate Social Work Students in the United Kingdom</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Teaching in Social Work</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cc79e1c51d841390f889336130c135f6"><gtr:id>cc79e1c51d841390f889336130c135f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Teater B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcaf2b1f512.81713583</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A209B004-2893-461E-B637-669526349AE6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantitative Research Methods for Social Work: Making Social Work Count</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d87b188dfd82cb7ff1df550877d41c02"><gtr:id>d87b188dfd82cb7ff1df550877d41c02</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Teater Barbra</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781137400260</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>586ce94712d936.63657335</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J011835/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FFA3A6C9-532B-4B83-B6F7-AAF3E63D34F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Stats., Comp. &amp; Methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
