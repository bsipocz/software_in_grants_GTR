Consequently, a clear picture of Victorian medievalism is crucial to understanding the culture of the period, and our inheritance from it. Medievalists looked to the past to make sense of a rapidly technologizing, urbanizing, globalizing present. Perhaps as a result of the extensive scope and remarkable complexity of this movement, scholars have tended to approach Victorian medievalism as a national movement. But writers, artists and architects in South West England were interested in the past as a way to define what was exceptional, authentic and exemplary about their region and its people -- as distinct from the nation as a whole. Our initial research reveals that South West medievalism responded in distinct ways to a growing sense of national homogeneity. According to South West medievalists, the universalizing, cosmopolitan urbanity of the metropolis threatened local identities they associated with such values as authenticity, a love of liberty, sympathy and a poetic sensibility intimately connected to the landscape of Cornwall and Devon. \n\nThis case-study will explore how communities turned to their regional histories and local landscapes in response to economic, technological and social change. This study will investigate how an influential aesthetic movement was used to promote a sense of community grounded in local identities that stretched back over the centuries. We will explore how designers and writers borrowed from the literary artefacts and visual imagery of their region's past in order to forge an aesthetic that they thought capable of inspiring 'sensus communis' - that is, a shared sensibility about what it means for the life of a community to flourish. Their particular vision of sensus communis did not aim at the universal as was the case with other artists and thinkers; rather, it aimed at the local and particular. We will trace how South West medievalists constructed ideas of community inseparable from local history and landscape. These ideas, we will show, were reflected in the art, architecture and literature they produced. \n\nWe believe that this is a timely study in light of recent challenges to retain and strengthen local character in the face of a globalizing world. Public attention has recently turned to consider the significance of the local within the global. However these are not solely new concerns: social disaffection, the loss of regional character and the disintegration of community were important issues in the nineteenth century. The discourse of Victorian medievalism lies at the root of our contemporary understanding of global vs. local. When communities feel under threat they reach for a common past. This study of Victorian Medievalism in South West England will demonstrate the ways in which the turn to a regionally-distinct past influenced the physical shape of the region and the cultural shape of its communities in often profound ways.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will impact the following:\n1) The Public:\nWorking with Dr Julien Parsons (Collections and Interpretation Officer) and Dr Thomas Cadbury (Curator of Antiquities) at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter (RAMM), we will launch an exhibition on Victorian Medievalism, which will open in 2013. This exhibition will have both a significant regional context and a wider remit, with materials gathered from local institutions and National Trust buildings, as well as such national galleries as the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum, the National Gallery and the Tate Britain. This exhibition will encourage the public to engage with cultural heritage and it will stimulate tourism to local historic sites, as many of the objects on display will be linked to key architectural sites in the South West, such as Knightshayes Court in Tiverton, Treverbyn Vean near St Neot and Castle Drogo at Drewsteignton. \n\n2) Beneficiaries in the Cultural Heritage Industry: \nAs the investigators will engage in genuinely collaborative work with conservationists, curators and other professionals in the heritage industry, the exhibition will make good contacts between the university and the museum, between researchers and the cultural heritage industry. The investigators will be working closely with project partners at the RAMM in the planning of the exhibition, as well as with collaborators at other galleries and at National Trust residences, with whom we will be sharing expertise. In the planning of the exhibition, the investigators will also consult architectural advocacy organizations (the Pugin Society, the Georgian Society, the Victorian Society, English Heritage's Cathedrals and Churches Advisory Committee). \n\n3) Longer Term Impact on Policy: \nOur South West case study will demonstrate the processes by which local British identities and regional allegiances are developed and fostered through literature, art, architecture and other cultural materials. Through interactive responses and a series of questionnaires, we will obtain feedback on the user experience of our South West exhibits. This will enable us and others to measure the impact of this project and to get a sense of how individuals interact with their cultural heritage. In scholarly circles and beyond, there is much discussion about the place of literature, its relation to other forms of cultural expression, and its role in the wider community. We would aim to address this debate by making our findings available (through talks, meetings and a journal publication) to those who work in areas of cultural policy and heritage advocacy. \n \n4) Local Archives, Regional Culture and the Public\nOur research will make use of neglected local archival holdings, which would be of great interest not only to researchers but to members of the wider community. We will make visible materials about the lives and work of such local historical figures as Sabine Baring-Gould, a hugely popular and prolific writer, ballad collector and architectural restorer in the nineteenth century. The public appeal of collections of such outstanding quality as are found in the South West will be high: the architectural artefacts and colourful life of the previously mentioned Henry Hems encourage peopel to feel connected to their communities, which impacts the quality of that community's cultural life, as well as that of the wider nation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146172</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Resources from the grant contributed to the work of the renowned artist Eleanor Crook.

This focus has informed our museum exhibition, and the development of a wide range of public activities (for all ages and backgrounds). This has achieved impact beyond academia, and will continue to have more in the coming months. The range of activities include BBC radio interviews, the development of television programmes, film festivals, public debates, children's activities, poetry workshops, church and architectural tours, and theatre productions. In addition, we have collaborated with National Trust staff, archivists, curators and practitioners in the creative industries in order to bring our research on the subject of identity, conservation and aesthetic, political and social uses of the past to a wider audience. 

Update, 2017: the original research for this project has now traveled with Wagner to China, where she has given a public lecture in Beijing, April 2016, and has been invited back to give a further lecture in Beijing April 2017, and will also travel to Hong Kong and Shanghai, where she will participate in university lectures and debates. This stems from research stemming from the relationship between the Victorian built environment, disease, health and well-being.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D8E596AC-3DB2-4466-8BF9-50A079D28719</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460a15482abe0.53971905</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) Significant new knowledge generated: a) This was a study about regionalism and community identity, but as we began our investigations, we realized that Victorian Medievalism was much more of a global enterprise than we expected. We found that local craftspeople and architects were deeply influenced by for example, Turkish designs, Greek myth, and Chinese styles. As a result, we have formulated new arguments about the relationship between the local and the global, and now understand much more about how designs, literatures, ideas and ideologies circulated globally. We have also discovered how, certain types of global exchange encouraged a turn toward 'local pasts' in order to resurrect regional identities. 
b) Most people would view Victorian medievalism, associated with figures like John Ruskin and William Morris, as divorced from scientific or medical issues. We have discovered, though, that science and medicine often motivated the turn to the past. Not only that, Victorian medievalist architects, designers and writers used the past to engage in debates about epidemic, utilitarian medical policies, the sanitation movement, and specific engineering works, such as sewer systems, train lines, and pumping stations. 
c) We discovered just how widespread and influential the 'gothic' or medieval past was--it was drawn on and celebrated by thinkers of almost every political, aesthetic, and religious persuasion--and how much of an effect that has had on our landscapes, urbanscapes and our ideologies. This study has given us insights into how this movement (if, given its variety, we can call it that) continues to shape political discourse, questions of communal and national identity, social values and beliefs. 2) Important new research resources identified: We have discovered new archival sources surrounding the careers of regional craftspeople and architects, and their global links. For example, we have discovered an archive of a key figure in our study of regional medievalism, the designer Harry Hems (he worked on hundreds of South West churches and civic buildings). There is a collection of his voluminous scrapbooks at the Exeter Archives, which give us a picture of Victorian architecture and the issues surrounding conservation. As well, the Royal Albert Memorial Museum has a warehouse, in which there are a large number of original, authentic medieval woodcarvings that he collected in the nineteenth century, which hadn't been seen by public audiences until this project. 
3) Important new research questions: The PI has research interests in the medical humanities, and rather unexpectedly, discovered that the Victorian medievalist movement was, in part, motivated by fears about epidemics and contagion and significantly informed by the sanitation movement. In addition, medievalist architects responded to questions surrounding such medical issues as the Anatomy Act as well as new medical technologies. New questions about the relationship between the arts and medicine/science that have emerged have motivated a new project.
 4) Collaborations and partnerships with the Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM), the National Trust, and the Exeter Cathedral have exceeded expectations. Together we produced a series of varied events, targeted at different audiences, which received, enthusiastic testimonials, positive media response and requests for further events.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. As detailed above, this project has opened up unexpected new avenues of research. The PI has half completed a monograph on the relationship between architecture and issues surrounding the body, and has been presenting on this at conferences and other events. This will form the basis of a major new project, involving partners in the creative industries, architectural history and medical history, among others. The CI is also part of a five-year funded project The Past in its Place, which looks at the 'history of memory' in a range of English and Welsh locales.
2. There is scope for much more collaborative work with museum and gallery curators. Working with the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter has been an incredibly profitable experience for all partners and for a wide variety of public users. We have learned about how our research can inform art commissions, curatorial decisions, conservation, and interpretation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3DBD1161-09BE-4310-B99A-DA89CD8F2703</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460a1ae209cc6.07051297</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.rammuseum.org.uk/exhibitions/art-soul-victorians-and-the-gothic</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Museum Practice Royal Albert Memorial Museum</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B31ADAA5-E8C1-4A35-AA67-532C72A9BF54</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Through this project, Exeter's Royal Albert Memorial Museum was able to adopt a more 'holistic' approach to curation of exhibitions. They linked with academics at the University of Exeter, officers at the National Trust, and various community groups to implement a series of events that introduced the issues of heritage and conservation to sectors of the public that would otherwise not be reached. In addition, by linking with the Victorian Society, exhibition spaces and objects were used to raise historical and current questions about the impact that architecture and environments have on daily lives. These types of collaborations have become a greater part of RAMM's remit, and this exhibition has become a model for exhibitions planned for the next several years -- a move that will enhance the quality of life for communities in the South West of England, and will encourage economic investment in the area.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d3fd2bd7c4a6.38886455</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6F9E0B31-7163-46F9-B9CF-4C5DD5633ED0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Art and Soul: The Victorians and the Gothic</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e4975baaec62f5157f43cb4380729ad7"><gtr:id>e4975baaec62f5157f43cb4380729ad7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parker, JM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781908326652</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5460a7eddf42f4.29665626</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F6F808F-315D-4D2E-A940-F0249486D8F2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Art and Soul: The Victorians and the Gothic</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2c1aaa5ca57e34f781e885e064c475e6"><gtr:id>2c1aaa5ca57e34f781e885e064c475e6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wagner, CM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781908326652</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54620190e11dd0.18456126</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F50227D7-D7E0-46C2-8800-BD731D664D9E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxford Handbook of Victorian Medievalism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e4975baaec62f5157f43cb4380729ad7"><gtr:id>e4975baaec62f5157f43cb4380729ad7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parker, JM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5460a761495730.92842031</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4250DE5F-9FFA-4ED7-A3CB-A9587BDC3B27</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxford Handbook to Victorian Medievalism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2c1aaa5ca57e34f781e885e064c475e6"><gtr:id>2c1aaa5ca57e34f781e885e064c475e6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wagner, CM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5460ab906130a9.50677369</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3FD4C834-888E-494F-9F4C-96FBF4BB6831</gtr:id><gtr:title>Britannia Obscura: Mapping Britain's Hidden Landscapes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/af9bb22ccbdac3b81104898f98e1f804"><gtr:id>af9bb22ccbdac3b81104898f98e1f804</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parker Joanne</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>1784700002</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56cdd8b66a3d00.35576628</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C55FE012-0FB7-4679-A92F-E1BFD8AA4AF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxford Handbook of Victorian Medievalism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e4975baaec62f5157f43cb4380729ad7"><gtr:id>e4975baaec62f5157f43cb4380729ad7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parker, JM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5460a689ef4da0.86651864</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>73234AA4-4B5D-4DBC-BCE4-CB1B4125AEFF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Art &amp;amp; Soul: Victorians and the Gothic</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/af9bb22ccbdac3b81104898f98e1f804"><gtr:id>af9bb22ccbdac3b81104898f98e1f804</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parker Joanne</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781908326652</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56cdd90039ba58.26520328</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I004513/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
