To be used this information must be copied into a related polymer, RNA. Two major classes of RNA product are made. The stable RNAs play key functional roles in several metabolic pathways, including the protein synthesis. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) carry the information that is used to specify the sequence, and therefore the structure, of the proteins. The mature functional forms of all RNAs are generated by complex pathways, which process the RNAs and assemble them into particles together with specific proteins. At all steps in gene expression, accuracy is of prime importance. However, high fidelity is energetically expensive and systems that are very accurate will always be slower and/or consume more energy than less accurate systems. Very frequently biological pathways combine a moderately accurate process with one or more proof reading steps that detect and either correct or degrade defective products. We hypothesise that RNA maturation pathways are continuously monitored by quality control systems, on which we will be focusing. We would like to understand how problems are detected, and how this leads to the destruction of the defective RNAs or RNA-protein complexes. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms governing nuclear RNA quality control. The many steps required for the production of fucntional RNAs have traditionally been studied as independent processes, and each of the participating groups is an expert in one (or a few) of these. To break new scientific ground pooling of expertises, tools and techniques from different fields and model organisms is needed - and this will be provided by the Nuclear RNA Surveillance network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Eukaryotic RNAs are produced and matured in the cell nucleus. Major events in the biogenesis of most RNAs, including splicing, 3' end processing and RNP formation, occur co-transcriptionally, on at least some tanscripts. Coupling with transcription increases the efficiency and specificity of the processing-packaging systems and sets up an assembly line with 'built in' quality control where a RNP maturation step will only occur if the preceding reaction was successful. This is because enzymes and complexes harboring RNA degradative activity are immediately available to rapidly degrade the RNAs of aberrant, or sub-optimal RNP molecules. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms governing nuclear RNA surveillance. We will analyse the mechanism and significance of the recognition and degradation of aberrant RNAs by the exosome complex of 3' to 5' exonucleases and is cofactors, notably the Trf4/Air/Mtr4 polyadenylation complex (TRAMP4).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>218676</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project formed part of the EUROCORES RNA Quality programme. This network aimed to study RNA metabolism using a combination of genetics, cell biology and biochemical approaches in human cells and budding yeast. 

Eukaryotic cells contain a huge range RNA species, almost all of which are synthesised by post-transcriptional processing. The degradation of nuclear pre-mRNAs and cytoplasmic mRNAs, as well as accurate 3' processing of many stable RNA species, involves the exosome - a complex of ten core proteins with 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. Since the exosome mediates both precise RNA processing and total RNA degradation (in some cases of the same RNA species under different conditions) the regulation of its activity is of key importance and is mediated by multiple nuclear and cytoplasmic cofactors. 

A major component of this project was the identification, in collaboration with other participants in the network, of novel cofactors for the exosome. The Tollervey and Jacquier labs jointly published a report on the characterization of a novel RNA quality control factor Mpp6 (Milligan et al. 2008). The Tollervey and Proudfoot labs worked closely together to co-submit two papers describing a novel mechanism in the termination of transcription by RNAs Polymerase I (El Hage et al. 2008, Kawauchi et al. 2008). Of these, the paper by the Tollervey lab made use of reagents provided by the Proudfoot lab. Both of these projects were proposed in the initial application by the Tollervey lab.

The analysis of other factors that were identified in our genetic screens together with the Jacquier group are still ongoing. The analyses were more challenging than anticipated and required the development of new techniques for determining the location and distribution of modified forms of RNA polymerase II. We anticipate that these analyses will both give significant biological insights and provide tools that are of wide applicability. 

The procedures developed for the determining the location and distribution of modified forms of RNA polymerase II have now been improved and exploited and will form the basis of several research publications. We anticipate that the insights generated will inform future understanding of eukaryotic gene expression.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C9628C34-1F2D-45C0-A09E-4DB3F0E6AEA2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5457a37b631e19.98589759</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The genetic information in all creatures is encoded in the sequences of long molecules of DNA. In order to be used, this information must be copied into a related molecule called RNA. The synthesis, modification and degradation of RNA lie at the heart of the information processing system of any cell. RNA processing appears to be remarkably ubiquitous; all characterized RNA species in eukaryotic cells require post-transcriptional processing to generate the mature, functional forms. This applies both to the mRNAs that carry the genetic information and to the many stable, non-protein coding RNAs, which play important roles in cell metabolism. The faithful expression of the genetic information is of crucial importance in all organisms. To ensure this, the maturation of RNA and its assembly with specific RNA-binding proteins are subject to stringent surveillance. This project has shed light on the mechanisms involved in these key quality control pathways. 

It was long believed that human DNA contained a series of distinct genes, each copied into a discrete RNA product and separated by non-expressed &amp;quot;junk&amp;quot; DNA. However, it turns out that almost the entire human genome is copied into RNA products - but most are degraded very quickly. This project has helped us understand how this large population of unstable RNAs is identified and targeted for rapid degradation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The techniques and approaches developed during this work formed the basis for several subsequent studies by my research group and are also being applied by other researchers in the UK and elsewhere. They allowed the characterisation of gene expression in novel ways and increased understanding of the interaction between the synthesis of RNA molecules and the subsequent fate of the RNAs. These insights will continue to be of influence on biological research in many systems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0CBEC1E7-AC79-4B7E-B5F6-35C366E50F50</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545768e751f255.97348039</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a method for the transcriptome-wide localization of modified forms of RNA polymerase II.
