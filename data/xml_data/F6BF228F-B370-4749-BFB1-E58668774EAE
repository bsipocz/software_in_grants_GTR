Such new materials do more than transform technology, they change behaviour and shape the urban landscape, from our cities, to our hospitals, to our homes, to our art. Thus, materials are a defining characteristic of society: its history, culture and economic welfare. As a result materiality is one of the central themes of study in every university. However in contemporary universities the scientists involved in making new materials (physicists, chemists, materials scientists) very rarely get involved with those who study the cultural significance and impact of materials (humanities and social scientists), and are often further distanced from those who make things with materials (medics, engineers, architects, designers, artists). This has a serious detrimental effect on the research and teaching culture of universities, and their capacity to engage with the wider world, since many of the important issues of contemporary society, such as health, security, climate change and economic sustainability, require a multi-disciplinary approach. The aim of this research project is to build the Materials Innovation Hub within King's College London whose guiding principle will be that all materials innovation benefits from a system-wide multidisciplinary approach involving the arts, humanities, social sciences, physical sciences and health sciences. The Hub will be a focal point for developing our understanding of how materials, materiality and material culture affect the human realm, be it in the form of a new type of artificial limb, or a new form of human expression. It will be a place of wonder, play and ambitious ideas - a place to initiate innovation and culture change within the university and the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>At present there is almost no relationship between materials scientists and creative industry professionals in the UK. This status quo is not ideal for a number of reasons. Firstly, the creative industries are economically very important. In the UK these industries employ 1.3 million people, generate 112.5 billion p.a., account for 9.1% of the GDP, and are widely acknowledged as being among the most buoyant sectors in the British economy. However they are not playing their full role in determining the focus of publicly-funded materials research. Secondly, the creative industries have a long history of posing provocative problems which in turn drive forward the science agenda; for example the need for materials that transform their properties in response to digital stimuli for virtual touch: such new materials have already impacted the phone industry but could impact architecture, jewellery, and many other aspects of product design. Thirdly, materials have an immense cultural significance and the introduction of new materials by an isolated materials science community holds the prospect of further deepening the rift between scientists and society. Fourthly, the environmental impact and sustainability of materials manufacturing is dependant very much on the social and cultural use of the technology. Thus a more nuanced understanding of materials, materiality and materials culture is urgently needed in the UK. We will create a Materials Innovation Hub which will be the first UK research centre that brings together materials science and materials culture research in the same institution. As the Hub matures it will address the four issues outlined above and this will deliver the following benefits to the UK: Creative Industries - This project will create a Materials Innovation Hub which will give creative companies from across the sector a dedicated place to undertake long-term research, leverage government funding, collaborate on the development of new materials, and raise the national profile of their innovations in this area. Materials Industries - The materials industries will benefit from a steady flow of materials innovation that emerges from the Materials Innovation Hub. The materials library within the Hub will provide a place for these industries to showcase their materials, and so give them greater visibility in the creative industries. Museums - Museums and other organizations within the heritage sector operate at the intersection of materials science and materials culture on a daily basis through their work on the preservation, conservation, curation, and, increasingly, digitisation of objects within their collections. It is expected that many of the Hub's research projects will have a direct impact on these activities. Government Agencies - This project will address questions of how materials research might be applied to specific sectors, such as UK architecture, heritage, design, or craft, and how in turn such findings might be fed back into Government policy-making in these areas. We will facilitate public discussion on these issues, supply leadership, and provide evidence to the UK policy-makers on issues of materials manufacture and usage. Universities - This project will aim to raise the profile of the creative industries among the materials science research and teaching communities as a sector worthy of research and study, and so help the nation's universities compete globally in this rapidly-growing area. The long term impact of the project relies on the longevity of the project within King's and in particular in the Materials Innovation Hub being integrated within the Somerset House cultural precinct that will develop over the next ten years, in which King's is the major academic partner.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>290647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A 90 minute documentary film about the science and art of food.</gtr:description><gtr:id>91E25FD1-FCBD-4EB5-8B27-2813EDC7104B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Viewed in 200 countries worldwide on BBC World.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ab230f052e42.42926766</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Chef versus Science: The Ultimate Kitchen Challenge</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0752bbd</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Dr Hilary Powell and Prof Julian Evans received a small research grant for work on the project 'Metal Skies and Shades of Brick: Urban Print and Palette' to put the physical remnants of industrial decline to creative use. Hilary salvaged an array of materials from the demolition site and using these to create images of processes and sites of urban change. Reclaimed roofing zinc and copper were used as etching plates and heavy demolition machinery became alternative printing presses. Using specialist machinery (like vibroenergy mills) and expertise within the Chemistry department, the team developed a palette of intaglio ink pigments and washes made from ubiquitous urban materials ground to micron-size powders. London stock brick ink became the urban alternative to burnt sienna/ochre, lime mortar is used for off-white, chimney soot becomes the original lamp black and manganese-rich brick stock is used for red and purple tones.

The book was designed in collaboration with numerous practitioners, including the London Centre for Book Arts and Calverts Cooperative Press. A team of 'pop-up apprentices' were recruited to help with the production of the books, many of whom were Institute of Making members from a range of UCL departments (Slade, Life Sciences, Engineering). The book charts an imaginative history of this changing area of the Lea Valley, and the project returned skilled craft and cultural production to a site of former manufacturing and invention. Photos of the book in production can be seen here: https://twitter.com/HilarySPowell/media

The pop-up apprentices all received coaching in paper engineering, bookbinding and printing techniques, as well as copy of the book at the end of the event. The book itself was Winner of the Birgit Skiold Award as part of the London Art Book Fair at the Whitechapel Gallery (September 2014).

Events have included masterclasses in blacksmithing, flintknapping and an introduction to animatronics, for example. These activities have enabled those attending to gain an insight into the practice and philosophy of expert makers and a chance to discuss broader issues around materials and making.

These introductory masterclasses open up research and making opportunities to our members. They have encouraged those new to materials and making to become more involved in other activities at the Institute of Making, including research events, interdisciplinary collaborations, citizen science projects and exploratory making activities. They have also encouraged materials experts and experienced makers to become involved in areas of research and practice outside their normal remit.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54626664b26392.82886040</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cheltenham Science Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6BE5D260-ACF7-4E15-94E6-16576E219397</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk on the Science of Chips</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c02b06399464.04644988</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Institute of Making Public Events</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>950D5970-2A8E-411D-937B-B6E40DA04EE2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organised several different kinds of public event, ranging from talks and masterclasses run by expert makers for small groups to large scale public extravaganzas. Masterclasses and talks for the public included flintknapping with archaeologist Karl Lee, a 'smell walk' with Dr Victoria Henshaw and 'bodging' and repairing with designer Jasleen Kaur, for example. During our large open days we threw wide the doors of the Makespace and the Materials Library to the public and organised various making activities designed to appeal to seasoned makers, first-time tinkerers and families alike, and curated a themed selection of materials for visitors to explore in the Materials Library. Themes have included 'Plastic Fantastic', 'Luminescence' and 'Foam', for example. We have had many return visitors at these public open days, and the public engagement programme has inspired people to explore new areas of interest, acquire new skills, and engage with experts in diverse fields of materials research and making. For a full list of events up until March 2014, see our annual report: http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/blog/2014/05/first-year-report and for events since then, see the URL below.

Between 2013 and 2014 we hosted eight public open days at UCL with a total attendance of approximately 3500 including a high representation from families and children. Through these events the public get both a taste of the Makespace and Materials Library, and a chance to meet and interact with our wonderful and knowledgeable community of members. This public programme is extremely popular, with many events being booked up in less than five minutes of being released and with extensive waiting lists forming. For example, 1156 people applied to attend Roja Dove: An Olfactory Experience, for which there were only 40 spaces available. We instigated the first Festival of Materials and Making at King's College, and have instituted an annual Festival of Stuff at UCL.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54626865b9f8b0.95985097</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011,2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UCLoo Festival: 'Meet the Makers' evening and 'Makeathon'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F5E5EB29-4E4F-46D7-BF0C-7820D088F822</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The UCLoo Festival was a public series of events and exhbitions exploring sustainable solutions to the global sanitation crisis, held at UCL in November 2013. The Festival was organised by Dr Sarah Bell (Civil Engineering), Dr Barbara Penner (Bartlett School of Architecture) and Dr Tse-Hui The (Bartlett School of Planning), and the Institute of Making funded and hosted a 'Make-a-thon' that allowed students to design and make a new toilet, with prototypes being exhibited to the public in the North Lodge at UCL. This included a 'Meet the Makers' evening that kickstarted the celebrations, in which 3 innovative toilet systems were showcased to inspire the makers: Loowatt's waterless energy-generating toilet system, Tiger toilet's worm-composting dry toilet and Envirolet's vacuum-flush and composting loos. Students then had 2 weeks to design and make their new designs to promote sustainable sanitation.

The UCLoo team won 'Public Event of the Year' at the inaugural UCL Communications and Culture Awards.

- Creating a physical hub (Institute of Making) to promote interdisciplinary working and encourage research activities between departments at UCL on the theme of materials and making. 
- Building a membership of 3880 people to date from across UCL, with the following demographic breakdown: female (927), male (1119), no gender declaration (1334), undergraduates (802), postgraduates (1165), academic staff (390), professional services staff (178), physical sciences (1466), arts and humanities (550) and social sciences (205).
- Curating 39 events (research workshops, masterclasses and talks) on a wide variety of themes to build multidisciplinary links between the physical sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities.
- Funding 51 interdisciplinary research projects, involving 141 researchers from 9 of the 10 UCL Faculties. 
- Involving 23 undergraduate and postgraduate students as named contributors to those research projects, as well as countless other unnamed students involved in research/teaching crossover activities.
- Instigating an annual Festival of Materials and Making at UCL and holding 8 open days to engage the public in materials and making-related activities at UCL.
- Developing a distinctive method of interdisciplinary working which is beginning to serve as a model for other researchers at UCL and further afield.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our experience of bringing together and running a multidisciplinary hub at UCL is of interest to other researchers at UCL, as well as researchers at academic institutions further afield. Researchers at UCL are beginning to draw on our method of working in the development of future 'bridging the gaps' projects. A number of research workshops that have materials and making activities at their centre and a practical, hands-on element have also been instigated at UCL following on from this project, including the Emotions, Transformations and Restorations series and the Material Properties FIGS Forum. We have also been drawing on the experience gained through the Bridging the Gaps project to inform the work of the EU FP7 Light Touch Matters (LTM) consortium (EU FP7-NMP-2012-SME-6). The LTM project aims to bring materials researchers and designers together to develop a new generation of affordable products that use flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and piezoelectric polymer technologies in such a way that the whole product responds to touch by lighting up. In this context, designers are not just using a new material with a set of predetermined physical parameters; they have the opportunity to influence the development of these materials as they emerge. In order for this to be successful, designers need to be able to communicate effectively with materials scientists so that materials can be developed with desired functionalities and properties. There is therefore a need for specialist tools for interdisciplinary translation between materials researchers and designers. We have been able to draw on our experience of running successful hands-on, material-focussed workshops to enhance the dialogue between designers and materials scientists.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8EB90AB5-B784-4DA8-9991-851730FAC292</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54625e02bfb1b2.43338592</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Electronics,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/blog/2014/05/first-year-report</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Importance of Materials Libraries in Research</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AE7AC4A3-68D9-460A-9B93-26AD266DCB0B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have pioneered the role of Materials Libraries in research institutions.

The materials library contains more than a thousand material samples. Some are exotic, such as aerogel, uranium glass or self-healing concrete, but the vast majority are the materials used in everyday practice and in manufacturing around the world. Our Institute also contains a fully kitted-out workshop containing a laser cutter, milling machine, kiln, kitchen, 3D printer, sewing machines etc. We do not have every tool, but we but we aim to provide a representative sample of different making
techniques. Our aim is to create a workshop where you use the materials discovered in the library to prototype ideas or explore how they behave when processed in different ways to better understand their affordances. Together, these two resources and the connection between them create the right environment where complex problems that sit outside the traditional boundaries of any one discipline can be addressed. The hands-on testing of existing material objects and processes, an exploration of the Materials Library and the construction of prototypes all become part of the thinking process. This is problem-solving by doing: not because theory is irrelevant to tackling complex problems, but because making stuff stimulates a different set of ideas and a creative approach.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EDE296D6-EFA4-49B0-9583-CFFBE6DE721D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A fundamental change in the materials research culture of the UK, and increasingly internationally, to focus as much on hands-on experimentation as a method of building interdisciplinary research teams and projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cefe2b2c512.28277801</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The Institute of Making</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Bridging the Gaps project has given us the opportunity to experiment with the most effective ways to encourage interdisciplinary interactions and conversations. We have observed that discussions stimulated by objects, materials and the making process have the ability to encourage conversations across disciplinary boundaries in a way that a purely verbal conversation cannot. We therefore explored how different combinations of presentations, demonstrations, material explorations, discussions and making tasks contributed to a successful multidisciplinary conversation. We developed a hands-on approach to interdisciplinary dialogue, designed to encourage play with materials as a way of learning about their affordances and engaging with different disciplinary approaches to them. As anthropologist Tim Ingold (2007, 2012) has argued, a hands-on engagement with materials and processes can lend a different kind of understanding of their behavioural qualities than desk-based rumination. As part of our research workshops we challenged researchers to explain their work through object-centred presentations, instead of relying on pre-existing powerpoints aimed at peers in their own disciplines, and each of our research workshops involved a making activities, demonstration or materials handling session, alongside more traditional academic presentations and discussions. 

Our research workshop themes have included: Radioactive Materials; London Incorporated: the Body and the City; Materials at the Centre; 3D Manufacturing: Promises, Pitfalls and Potential; Making Repairs; Materials Library Meets History of Art; Materials Library Meets Digital Humanities; Materials and Society Conference; Health, Safety and Creativity in Artistic Practice.

We also encouraged and supported a number of hands-on workshops led by other researchers, including the 'Ad Hoc' Material Properties reading group on Wax; the Emotions, Transformations and Restorations series (3 workshops); Dinner with Picasso (6 workshops) and 'From Invention to Consumption: Electronic Textiles'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>584CDC3C-9970-4449-A6CC-90B300C267FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These research events have brought together a multidisciplinary group of researchers who are interested in materials and making-related research.

We have gone to great lengths to curate the space itself in a way that encourages students, staff and researchers to interact with each other whilst using the equipment and library. By having members from diverse backgrounds and disciplines sharing the same space, they can, and do, learn from each other. This happens organically when undergraduates learn about the practice of research by working in the same space and using the same equipment as PhD students, postdocs and staff. Equally, researchers sometimes learn about making techniques from their students. Our summer studentship scheme has played a crucial role in developing teaching-research interaction; they funded an undergraduate student to do interdisciplinary research over the summer through a collaboration between two different departments.

The idea is that helmets of the future will be made-to-measure using 3D scans of the customer's head, and then printed to order. The technology James is developing is based on lightweight honeycomb structures developed for the aerospace industry. These are strong, stiff, and light but can easily crumple to absorb impact forces. By 3D printing these structures, not only does the helmet become tailored to the user, but it can be customised for them too, allowing them to optimise comfort, weight, breathability, and most crucially the protection against different impact modes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>637FF328-80FD-44EC-B328-63E2594604D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Cycle head injuries typically involve not just direct forces to the skull but also rotational forces too. These rotational forces can cause severe brain bruising and permanent damage, but are not mitigated against in current EPS bicycle helmets. James' design allows for rotational elements within the helmet honeycomb mechanism to be incorporated to absorb these rotational forces. Such mechanisms are expensive to incorporate in normal bicycle helmets (eg. MIPS), but with 3D printing this complexity comes for free. James' prototypes attracted attention from the venture capital world; he found a business partner, and with help from UCL Advances he has started a company called Bentham 3D and has won a UCL Bright Ideas Award of &amp;pound;15,000 to develop the business.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463b241730a34.00102528</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.bentham3d.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2014</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>30EADD31-B387-4A5C-8BB8-011AAF644278</gtr:id><gtr:title>Derivation
