This project will explore the relationship of original flutes, historical pedagogies, scholarly literature and original sources of music. Aspects of interpretation described by editors and musicologists but not usually undetaken by performers, involve questions that are not answered in the original notation, for example, the 'twilight zone' area of ornamentation. These performance questions will be restored to performers and answered in rehearsals through use of working editions taken directly from Renaissance part books. Styles of performance for the Renaissance flute will be researched and rehabilitated by bringing together distinguished performers for study days, public recitals and recordings. Editions of music for flutes will be edited and published, with complete critical apparatus and essays on performance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>188301</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An edition of previously unedited music for consort of Renaissance flutes, comprising some 55 French chansons by leading 16th century composers.

The repertoire was researched, edited and directed by Nancy Hadden, and represented an entirely new body of repertoire which had not been recorded before. Most of the music was in original editions in the British Library, some necessitated the construction of missing parts, all of it needed to be made into performing parts and scores for the use of the 11 singers and instrumentalists.

I have made 3 CDs which are relevant to my research, these are listed in the outcomes. For all 3 CDs, I edited the music from original sources, prepared editions, selected musicians, wrote all CD liner booklets, translations, editing, and jacket materials. All the CDs were self-funded, because the AHRC award did not fund the costs of the CDs. The CDs were released on my own Zephyrus label, and are available online and in music shops.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9F37716C-3EE5-4721-8BA1-218FA091BDCA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e01db5761903.09309492</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>04E777D5-F4C6-4B7F-8625-89C364274113</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Accordez vos flutes'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Traverso</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3b7baf5776e61b4a709174a912b1c821"><gtr:id>3b7baf5776e61b4a709174a912b1c821</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nancy Hadden</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dafd4dd17495.28084237</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D502217/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47D79871-3D9E-42F7-83E1-354D081901C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
