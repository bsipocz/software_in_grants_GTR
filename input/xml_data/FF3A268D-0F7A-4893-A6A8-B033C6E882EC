With two key outputs in the form of a digital archive and a monograph, and an accompanying campaign of public engagement, this project brings to life Bethlehem's modern history of global movement and exchange. In so doing, it creates a new way of thinking about the role of global influences in Middle Eastern history. Between 1860 and 1930 merchants from the town circulated the globe, selling Bethlehem-made devotional objects such as crosses, rosaries and model shrines. Their creation of a Bethlehem 'brand' helped produce today's image of the sleepy hilltop village of the nativity. But it also brought unprecedented change to the real Bethlehem. As the town's residents adopted increasingly transnational lifestyles, they transformed tiny Bethlehem into one of the most globally connected, socially dynamic towns anywhere in the Middle East. This matters to wider understandings of the region because global dynamics in this critical period are usually presented as arriving from the 'outside' via European imperialism, Zionism, and western missionaries. By contrast this project reinstates Arab Palestinians as active shapers of the region's entanglement with globalisation. 

Recent scholarship has paid close attention to the mass migrations out of Ottoman Syria (which included Palestine) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries - movements that laid the foundations of today's global Arab diaspora. But the impact of these migrations on local Middle Eastern society has not yet been systematically explored. Bethlehem provides the opportunity to do this, not just because its residents' migrations were inherently circular, but also because they served as 'pioneers' for hundreds of thousands to follow in their wake. People from all over the region mimicked their success selling 'Holy Land' objects, often feigning affiliation with Bethlehem and Jerusalem where none existed. As with the Bethlehem merchants, they largely hailed from small towns and tended to reinvest their new wealth back in their place of origin. By the turn of the 20th century a discernible migrant 'nouveau riche' had appeared across the Middle East, exerting a disruptive but hitherto undocumented impact on structures of class, family, gender and religiosity.

The project's two major outputs will explore this interplay between global migration and localised social change from differing yet complementary angles. First, the digital archive will provide an open access, online resource consisting of thousands of images, video/audio recordings, and interactive 3-D models that allow users to trace the global networks that have shaped Bethlehem's development. Once the archive's initial collection is made publicly accessible it will expand through crowd-sourced contributions from Bethlehem and its diaspora. Second, a monograph using a 'global microhistory' methodology will build on materials collected in the archive to reconstruct seminal moments in the life of one merchant from the town that encapsulate the transformations wrought by Bethlehem's global interactions. 

The PI's partnership with Leila Sansour, an acclaimed film-maker from Bethlehem, will locate this work between and beyond the academy, using Bethlehem as a case study to shed new light on pressing public debates surrounding Middle Eastern migration and mobility. Today we are used to images of Palestinians being restricted in their movements, but we are rarely presented with any longer historical context. The project's outreach programme will address this gap by contrasting the hyper-mobility once enjoyed by Bethlehem with the grave problems the town faces today on the fault-lines of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These activities will help restore Bethlehem's former sense of connectedness by bringing its unique story to new public audiences, as well as re-forging links across its global diaspora.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In its focus on an iconic but little understood Palestinian town, the research will create significant impact outside the academy. At the centre of the impact strategy is the idea of connectedness. By drawing attention to the global networks that once defined Bethlehem, the research will help re-connect the town to its diaspora as well as to new global audiences. The project will directly engage with the following three key user groups:

1. The Bethlehem community and its diaspora
The project comes at a key moment of rising interest among the Palestinian diaspora in reconnecting with its Palestinian heritage. This is particularly pronounced in Latin America which holds the largest concentration of Palestinians outside the Middle East, the majority of whom trace their origins to Bethlehem. Conversely, Bethlehem's position on the fault-line of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict means its ties to the outside world are increasingly restricted, most dramatically by the construction of the Israeli Separation Wall that today encloses the town. The project outputs, and especially the digital archive, will help counter this by forging new links between Bethlehem and its diaspora, providing communities with a means to explore the town's historic global connections and contribute to an ever growing and alive public archive.

2. Students and teachers in UK secondary schools
There are currently no prescribed aids for teachers and students in UK secondary schools and sixth forms focusing on Middle Eastern topics within exam board curricula. The project addresses this gap through the creation of lesson plans that use the digital archive as a resource, aimed specifically at years 9 and 12 of the UK curricula in History, Religious Studies and Citizenship. The lesson plans will allow students and teachers to explore key themes relating to the Middle East in a way that moves beyond common media portrayals of sectarian violence and extremism. They will navigate the digital archive's data to produce case studies relating to the specific curricula requirements for Middle Eastern and global topics within these three subjects. The educational material will be created in consultation with a strong and experienced team (see Pathways to Impact). The piloting of the lessons during the Fellowship will lead to the production of online materials disseminated on a national basis, providing a much-needed resource for both students and teachers.

3. Public audiences interested in the Palestine question 
The project will re-orient public perceptions of Palestine by providing new historical context on one of the key issues facing the Middle East today: mobility and migration. Impact activities will situate the contemporary Palestinian predicament within a longer pattern of declining mobility since the high-point of Bethlehem's global circulations a century ago. This will be made relevant to two specific groups. Firstly, international media outlets will be provided with articles and multi-media packages that help journalists and consumers make sense of these issues within a deeper historical framework. Secondly the project will engage government initiatives like DFID's Palestinian Programme and the British Council in Palestine, and UK-based NGOs such as the Palestinian Return Centre and Amos Trust, all of whom continually cite restrictions on Palestinian movement as the main factor constraining economic development in the Occupied Territories. Initiatives like the DFID-funded Palestinian Market Development Programme, specifically aim to counter this by &amp;quot;mapping the Palestinian diaspora and contributing to cross-fertilization between diaspora organizations&amp;quot;. All these factors are leading such groups to place increasing attention on Bethlehem - a town that plays a pivotal role in today's Palestinian diaspora. This interest will continue to rise in the run-up to the town's status as Arab Capital of Culture in 2020.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202418</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P013384/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8E63C4A9-31AC-4950-BF4C-643F945B707F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asian &amp; Middle Eastern Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
