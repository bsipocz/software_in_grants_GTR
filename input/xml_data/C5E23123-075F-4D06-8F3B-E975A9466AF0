The enzyme responsible for the first step in this process, Rubisco, does not work at its potential maximum efficiency at the current levels of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. If levels were much higher, photosynthesis would be increased and plant productivity would be higher. There is an immediate requirement for increased crop productivity to provide food for the rising population of the planet. Our project addresses this problem. We are studying a mechanism present in unicellular green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. During the initial CAPP1 programme, we discovered important new information about this mechanism, and using new and rapid methods we have identified novel algal genes and additional regulatory components which allow the CCM to operate in association with a specific micro-compartment called a pyrenoid. We have also successfully introduced some of these components into a model higher plant, Arabidopsis, and also successfully introduced a modified form of Rubisco which may facilitate aggregation into the pyrenoid. The ambitious goals of the CAPP2 extension will be to combine the expression of the CCM and pyrenoid in the Advanced Plant. Firstly, we will continue to identify genes required by the algae to achieve high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the cells, and develop new markers and sensors to reveal the location and activity of these genes when expressed in the higher plant. Secondly, we will identify additional regulatory elements needed to form a pyrenoid, as well as exploring the impact on Rubisco enzyme efficiency and light utilisation. Thirdly, we will continue to introduce successive components into our model Advanced Plant so as to &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; up the activities of CCM components and examine the extent of pyrenoid formation and enhanced productivity associated with the CCM. This work will provide new insights into how plants and algae acquire and use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, of great importance in predicting and coping with the current rapid changes in the atmosphere and hence in climate. The work will also contribute to strategies to increase global food security, because it will indicate new ways in which crop productivity can be increased.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The CAPP2 programme will continue to discover and characterise new components of the Chlamydomonas CCM, in addition to known bicarbonate pump(s) and carbonic anhydrases, and identify regulatory elements, protein modifications, linkers and chaperones needed to aggregate Rubisco into a pyrenoid and progressively incorporate key components into Arabidopsis. Our approaches include:
1) Identify and characterize components of the pyrenoid in Chlamydomonas, including growth phenotyping, complementation to identify the mutant locus and fluorescence tagging to identify pyrenoid-associated proteins. Pyrenoid defects will be screened by microscopy, Rubisco kinetics, CCM physiology and light use.
2) Pyrenoid structure, assembly and regulation will be defined using block-face scanning EM in Chlamydomonas and Advanced Plant chloroplasts. Chaperones and linkers will be identified using AUC and BN-PAGE, and other post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and S-S bond formation by LC-MS/MS.
3) To assemble a pyrenoid in the Advanced Plant gene cassettes will be assembled and/or stacked into delivery vectors for transformation. Additional &amp;quot;known&amp;quot; CCM components will be introduced and location tested by fluorescent tags (e.g. GFP), and levels of untagged components by polyclonal antibodies. Repression of all native Rubisco in Arabidopsis double mutants, and CCM characteristics will be combined in a single plant.
4) The advanced plant lines will be characterized physiologically to determine effectiveness of introduced CCM.
5) A FRET nanosensor will be developed to allow bicarbonate pools accumulated through the CCM to be visualized.
6) Modelling of inorganic carbon accumulation and effectiveness of pyrenoid operation will be undertaken in collaboration with colleagues at UIUC Illinois.
7) A central repository of genetic tools and materials will be developed for open access to the scientific and commercial communities.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

In a previous project, we generated modified plants that contain several components of the carbon concentrating mechanism from the alga Chlamydomonas. In this project, we will add new components of the carbon concentrating mechanism recently discovered by our project collaborators. We will monitor the effects on plant photosynthesis and productivity of the introduction of various combinations of these components.
