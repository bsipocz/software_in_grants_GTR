Life in urban peripheries is characterised by unevenness in economic and political terms, and challenges in terms of provision of, and access to, infrastructure, yet there is little understanding of how or why this occurs. Our project addresses this by mapping and detailing what changes are occurring, determining who in particular is driving these changes and why, and importantly, asking what the poverty implications of these processes are. In addition we identify a gap in understanding how life on the urban periphery is actually experienced by residents, thus we approach the issue of urban change through a 'lived experience' approach, outlined below. 

Our innovative approach will build on the small, but growing, research on African urban peripheries. Drawing on the expertise of the investigators, the project will examine seven cases within three African city-regions (Beall et al 2015): Gauteng, eThekwini and Addis Ababa. This choice of cases will ensure comparison across low and middle-income countries in Africa, but also between primary and secondary cities. These three city-regions display rapid but variable urbanisation, variable investment strategies, changing patterns of segregation and integration, and complex changes in governance structures. These processes offer us critical cases to develop urban theory, and to consider practical and policy outcomes to ensure poverty reduction. As is evident, our project uses two key ideas to structure our research, namely the spatial periphery of cities in Africa and, the idea of lived experience. Spatial peripheries are not necessarily places of economic, political or cultural marginality. They may be places of economic opportunity and innovation. They are however often poorly understood as attention has focused on more established and spatially central locations, or on edge-cities relying on American-based theories. Furthermore, case-based and comparative detailed empirical investigation is lacking. Our proposed research offers careful investigation into actual processes of change in specific cities in Africa. The focus on lived experience directs attention to the people who occupy the spaces along the spatial edges of African cities recognising that some residents live in these spaces out of choice, whereas others, however, have been coerced there through state or market actions. This idea of the lived experience of spatial change draws on significant intellectual threads in fields including urban studies, geography and planning theory, urban anthropology and sociology, and is concerned with how people live in places, including how they work, eat, parent (Meth 2013), love and die. 

It uses a mix of qualitative methods (including interviewing, diaries and auto-photography) to understand everyday life on the periphery. In addition the project uses key informant interviews, surveys, document analysis and mapping to understand the characteristics and drivers of changes, and also the governance and poverty implications of these urban changes. This project draws on the expertise of staff at Wits and Sheffield University, as well as the GCRO in Gauteng, and EDRI and ECSU in Addis Ababa, and benefits from a strong existing collaborative relationship, outlined below. The project expects to deliver: 8 academic papers, 3 working papers, pamphlets and posters to inform dissemination events; present at a minimum of 4 conferences; hold 7 dissemination workshops; and develop and sustain a project website and other media platforms.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit a wide range of stakeholders concerned with urban change and poverty reduction in urban peripheries. Key beneficiaries include: 

- At the local scale: Planners, housing officers, municipal government officials charged with infrastructure implementation and economic development, ward councillors / party political leaders, investors, local NGOs, residents' associations / area committees, relevant religious institutions, community leadership, and residents living in case study areas.
- At the city-region scale: district, provincial and national government officials (including Planning Commissions in eThekwini, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng) working in spatial planning, economic development and housing, and politicians. 
- At the sectoral scale: academic and policy-orientated audiences (in the UK, Africa and elsewhere) with an interest in issues of urban change, the social effects of infrastructural investments, poverty reduction and social inclusion.
- Academics and students (from Sheffield and Wits universities, project affiliate institutions and elsewhere) who engage with project outputs (publications, presentations, website etc.) and, potentially, utilise our data for future studies and publications.

The research will benefit the above beneficiaries by providing high quality data and analysis on processes of urban change and related impacts on poverty reduction in three city-region peripheries. Understanding the connections between different investments, interventions, and subsequent changes, and residents' direct experiences of these will contribute to more efficient implementation of urban policies and assist with evaluating existing governance and planning policies currently in place. It has the potential to impact thus on poverty reduction and increase urban inclusion. Findings will be relevant to each case study area, but also produce comparative analysis, facilitating comparisons between more or less successful strategies of urban inclusion. The analyses will be available for use by all stakeholders outlined above and will facilitate their engagement in urban development initiatives through providing them with accessible information about urban change in the peripheries and its significance for poverty. 

Plans for interaction with the above beneficiaries include:
1. The IAG who will meet at key stages during the project and are well placed to connect the project to a broad range of networks and interests.
2. Key stakeholders will attend inception workshops (in eThekwini, July 2016; in Gauteng, January 2017; and Addis Ababa, June 2017) to collaboratively draft and finalise the research focus and methods, ensuring data generated is beneficial to them.
3. The project website, and associated media briefs, will ensure the IAG, the stakeholders, residents and any other interested actors, can access up to date project information, appropriate data, analyses of trends and information about key institutions. This will contribute to enhancing knowledge, awareness and engagement at local and city-wide scales.
4. Targeted reflection and Dissemination workshops and related working papers will target stakeholders whose role it is to affect urban change, poverty reduction and urban inclusion. These will be available in paper and electronic format.
5. At these dissemination workshops, colour pamphlets and posters (including photographs) capturing residents' lived experiences in the peripheries will also be provided, with posters displayed in local community facilities beyond the workshops. This material will all be available on the project website, but material copies are essential in areas where IT access is limited.
6. Publications in both academic and policy-oriented journals, as well as presentations at academic and policy oriented conferences (especially World Urban Forum) will enable dissemination of results in an accessible form in South Africa, Ethiopia and the UK, as well as beyond</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>400765</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Advisory Group workshop in Johannesburg, September 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6FBA4BA5-3303-4F70-8D76-5CAD20847141</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We held a International Advisory Group panel meeting in Johannesburg in September 2016 with representatives from city and regional government as well as urban professionals based in Johannesburg to discuss our project objectives, choices of case studies and aims.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b56e1bbe9d46.03991301</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Local stakeholder workshop with community leaders in Waterloo, September 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93C2A7B0-E808-4033-899B-919DB7730EBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We held a local stakeholders workshop with community leaders (area committee members, community policing forum, ANC local representatives) in the community hall at Waterloo near Hammond's Farm (our first case study area) in the city of Durban / eThekwini in September 2016.
