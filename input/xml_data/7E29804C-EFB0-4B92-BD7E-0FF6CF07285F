Modern philosophising on the subject begins with Descartes and the rationalists. They regarded thought as universal, immutable, and rational, whereas language was merely expressive of it. Language was seen as an overt manifestation of thought, and could vary even when thought itself is not. Modern generative linguistics, by and large, adopts this point of view as well, regarding language as a cognitive 'module' that is relatively independent of thought. Within these views, language is not regarded as an organising principle for thought. Thought is taken to be organised by its own principles. In line with this common conceptualisation, language is not regarded as relevant for what it is to be rational, or for mental health. Language could fall away, and rationality and selfhood could be maintained. An alternative and older tradition in linguistics, however, opposes the separation of language and thought. Identifying a mode of thought that is only found in humans, this tradition maintains that language does not just express thoughts, but generates them. Without the generative mechanisms of language, and of grammar in particular, this particular mode of thought wouldn't exist. We call this an 'Un-Cartesian' view of grammar. The present project starts from a prediction that the Un-Cartesian view makes: where thought gets disorganised, grammar should get disorganised alongside, and vice versa. The Un-Cartesian view regards a particular set of grammatical principles as crucial to the organisation of meaning in language. Therefore, it makes specific prediction for which aspects of thought should break down when the grammatical principles in question do. We will explore these predictions through investigations of language in schizophrenia. Formal Thought Disorder (FTD) is one clinical symptom of schizophrenia, and which is diagnosed on the basis of abnormalities in language. In particular, we will examine if grammar as opposed to lexicon (vocabulary) is disrupted in people with FTD.
Apparent evidence against the Un-Cartesian view comes from acquired language disorders, for example conditions such as agrammatic aphasia following a stroke. In this case, language can fail to be understood and produced, yet the thoughts of the people concerned can seem normal. In the case of aphasia, there is initial evidence that the pattern of language breakdown is very different from language abnormalities found in schizophrenia. In this project, we will explore the behaviour of people with aphasia on the same tasks as those with schizophrenia in order to discover whether their grammatical profiles are distinct.
The present project assembles a multidisciplinary research team that crosses the boundaries of departments, faculties, and disciplines. We carry out theoretically guided research on language in the clinical context, and modify those theories in response to clinical evidence. We aim, in a first subproject, to extend our current research on the grammatical basis of reference in language (what speech is about). We then aim to sample spontaneous speech from people with schizophrenic thought disorder and to test whether these grammatical behaviours are specifically impaired. We also use a battery of newly designed language tests to profile language abnormalities in aphasia and schizophrenia. Finally, we will accompany our experimental work with a philosophical study assessing and rethinking the role of language for being a rational self. We hope that our project will contribute new tools for language assessment in clinical populations and generate fresh insights into both aphasia and schizophrenia, as well as shedding light on complex debates on the relationship between language and thought.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research we propose is primarily addressed to three kinds of community: the scientific community across a range of disciplines including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, psychiatry; clinicians in psychiatry, clinical psychology and speech and language therapy; and people with schizophrenia, people with aphasia and their families. In regard to Impact, our central interest is to contribute to a new understanding of the role and importance of language in schizophrenia and mental health more generally. Based on that, there may be potential for development of new psychological and behavioural therapies for the condition. In particular, our research could contribute to improved engagement techniques in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for people with schizophrenia and new techniques in this therapy for the treatment of thought disorder and negative symptoms such as alogia. 
In addition to increasing understanding of language impairments in schizophrenia and aphasia, the project is likely to produce new methods for evaluation of language in these conditions. The implicit language processing tools that will be developed and refined across the course of the project are not routinely used in clinical evaluation of language impairments. One component of subproject B will be to produce computerised assessment methods suitable for adoption in a wide range of clinical contexts. Furthermore, these implicit language assessments will be normed on healthy age-matched control samples in order to increase their clinical utility. These new tools may be refined and disseminated for use by NHS clinicians, in particular, speech and language therapists and neuropsychologists.
Methods and outcomes of research will be reported not only in standard academic outlets, but also in publications and conferences that are clinician-led. For example, at the American Psychiatric Association Annual meeting, ECNP and at the bi-annual schizophrenia research forum meeting, and in speech and language therapy in the annual conference of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and biennial conference of the British Aphasiology Society. We will also engage with local special interest groups (e.g., Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapy in Mental Health) in disseminating our ideas and findings and seek feedback on the project in order to stimulate future development and refinement. 
During the course of the project, we will engage with charities such as Mind and Rethink and NAMI. We will invite a member of service user group to join our project steering committee in order to benefit from their insights and reflections on our plans, and also to find ways to share the findings of the project with people with schizophrenia and their families. Similarly, we would engage with AphasiaNow (http://www.aphasianow.org/) an organisation led by people with aphasia and explore ways in which our research findings can be disseminated to people with language impairment.
The relationship between language, mind and thought is one which is of considerable interest to the media, particularly where it is illuminated by evidence from people with neurological or psychiatric difficulties. For example, previous work on aphasia and thought was reported on BBC News website, The Guardian, The Times and New Scientist. Professor Varley has given interviews to the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth (on inner speech and thought) and on Richard and Judy (language problems following stroke). Professor Turkington has presented on Radio America on the subject of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychotic symptoms, including thought disorder.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>745932</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited submission to Parliamentary Inquiry into Cerebral Palsy</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>934A41CB-E126-4444-BC3C-13F91475D381</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sparked new ideas and new ways of thinking

To examine the hypothesis that different sub-types of schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls, can be differentiated by the nature and frequency of pauses elicited during speech. 
BACKGROUND 
Disordered thought is a key symptom of SZ and is detected in a patient's speech. An important aspect of speech competence is pauses. Pauses during speech allow for discourse planning, word retrieval, dramatization and indicate breaks in the flow of speech and thought. Previous research has demonstrated that pauses occur in different syntactic locations, reflecting different discourse aims and cognitive processes, and their disruptions. 
METHOD 
20 Participants: 5 SZ patients with thought disorder (SZ+TD), 5 SZ patients without thought disorder (SZ-TD), 5 first-degree-relatives (FDR's) of the SZ patients and 5 controls, performed a task in which they were required to describe a story portrayed in an eight slide cartoon strip. These descriptions were audio recorded and transcribed. Pauses were annotated by position in the sentence: 'utterance-initial', 'between-clause pauses', and 'within-clause' pauses. They were analysed non-parametrically in SPSS. 
RESULTS 
Statistical analysis revealed that SZ-TD participants used significantly more pauses than controls, p =0.032. SZ+TD and SZ-TD participants used significantly more pauses between utterances in comparison to controls, p=0.016 and p=0.032, respectively (calculated as a ratio of the total number of pauses). SZ-TD participants used significantly less within-clause pauses in comparison to controls, p = 0.08. In between-clause-pause condition, there were no significant differences between groups, p &amp;gt; .05. 
CONCLUSION 
The frequency and types of pauses differ significantly across SZ in comparison with healthy controls. Our data support the use of formal linguistic analysis and may have application in diagnostic and prognostic assessment in high-risk groups and potential development of talk-based therapies like CBT.&amp;nbsp;In addition, the data support cognitive remediation adapted to have a focus on language and communication, with the prospect of improved day-to-day function in patients.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9151b870e23.90041354</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Use of ELAN to analyse video data for research and clinical practice.

Patients with schizophrenia, including those with formal thought disorder, are thought to struggle with making inferences in various situations. Little has been done to assess this supposed deficit on goal oriented tasks. To assess how such patients comprehend inferred details and integrate them into a coherent narrative participants were asked to create a story from a cartoon. The hypotheses were that the participant groups would give different numbers of concrete narrative elements and inferred narrative elements when telling the story.
Background
There is evidence that patients with schizophrenia struggle to comprehend abstract cartoon jokes (which would require inference) rather than more concrete slapstick cartoon jokes. There is also evidence that patients with schizophrenia focus more on concrete details than inferred abstract details.
Methods
Thirty-three participants (9 control, 11 Schizophrenia, 5 thought disorder, 8 first degree relatives) were given an 8 slide wordless cartoon showing a couple preparing a dinner party but before the event the meal disappears so the host must find dinner elsewhere. Participants were told to tell the story and marked on the number of concrete and inferred details identified.
Results
There was a statistically significant difference (Kruskall Wallis test) between the groups in the number of inferred details reported (H(3)=11.855, p=.008). There was a significant difference (post-hoc Mann Whitney U test) between the control group (M=7.56) and thought disorder group (M=3.40) (U=15.133, p=.026), and also the first degree relatives (M=8.00) and the thought disorder groups (U=-16.925, p=.011). There was no significant difference between the groups in the number of concrete details reported (H(3)=3.634, p=.304).
Conclusions
Patients with schizophrenia do not seem to struggle with narrative inferences whereas those with formal thought disorder do. Patients with schizophrenia and first degree relatives performed as well as controls. There was no difference in ability to identify concrete details between the groups, although this may be due to an experimental error. These data provide basis for further study with a greater variety of cartoons.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c915635a9d09.11778376</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talking brains</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>225883CA-E283-448B-AA3A-FE7A57D79BF3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a major exhibition project, arguably the first ever exhibition of language as a natural object or as an object of science. It is directly related to this grant as it centrally addresses language as a medium of thought and a means for understanding mental illness. Special installations are devoted to language schizophrenia, in autism, and in aphasia. The exhibition was bought at a multi-million level by the laCaixa foundation and will be on show for one year in Barcelona's CosmoCaixa's science museum, before it travels around the world. By now already, this exhibition has engaged mental health practicioners, speech therapists, patients, families of them, doctors, scientists, and students.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c81beb5b0785.55114122</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Predicting Language: an interactive installation part of London's Bloomsbury Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BAECB35-9442-424F-83CF-E864CF8617E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>When listening to language, we do not merely interpret what we heard. Instead, we &amp;quot;produce ahead&amp;quot;, anticipating at grammatical and semantic levels what can come next. At the widely advertised Bloomsbury Festival 2016, with its focus on language, we offered visitors an opportunity to take part in a behavioural experiment which demonstrated this capacity. Our aims were to engage the public, share knowledge about language processing and make visitors think about how their language system works. Alongside the experiment the installation contained a short presentation about the language system. After the experiment, participants learned about their performance (so they could compare with friends) and received a badge as a souvenir.

The installation was set up on the campus of the University College London on October 22nd 2016 from 11am to 5pm. About 150 people participated in the experiment, and we estimate that a total of 300 people visited the installation. The installation raised ,amy questions from the audience, mainly about the types of information processed when we produce and understand language, and about ways language can be disrupted due to different pathologies. Visitors reported that they found it exciting to engage with the experiment and the researchers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c28f3d2751d3.04087887</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://bloomsburyfestival.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BF16-spreads-web-18-sept.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A full impact statement can only be provided at the end of this grant. But even as of now, it is clear that this project has significantly impacted on clinical diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives and practices, in particular in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). A specific study on the benefits of linguistic analysis to understand who profits from CBT and who does not is currently underway, though it was not factored into this grant initially. 

A second form of impact has come from a major exhibition curated by this PI called Talking Brains. It exhibits for what we think is the first time, language as a natural object and as an object of science. It has been bought at a multi-million level by the laCaixa foundation and is expected to attract around 10.000 visitors during its first show during one year in the CosmoCaics science museum in Barcelona starting from April 2017. The language-thought relationship, and the significance of language to mental health, is a central topic in this exhibition, which aims to raise awareness for this foundational question and its practical significance.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7570E000-E774-4B84-B1FD-D69F8F5016B9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c257c48e3523.34927988</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have now completed the core data collection of the project, in an expanded project scheme going far beyond the one stated in the application. In particular, in phase 1, spontaneous speech data have been obtained along with clinical and neuropsychological ones, and a completely novel linguistic annotation scheme has been developed with which the speech data have now been analysed in the instance of a cartoon retelling task. These data are being analysed now as we speak, and first results emerge that show dysfluencies in particular syntactic positions characterise the patient group, and in part specifically the thought disorder group. Dysfluencies in the aphasia group on the same test are lilely to show the opposite pattern. The grammatical analysis also shows anomalies in referential use of definite Noun Phrases, as predicted in the project. Neuropsychological tests are revealing interesting group differences between the aphasics and the schizophrenia patients. For phase 2 we developed novel online and offline psycholinguistic comprehension tests.
