The electrons that are released during the oxidation are transported from the molybdenum centre to the other side of the enzymes, where they are handed over to a terminal electron acceptor. Light absorption can cause electron transfer from one part of a molecule to another or between molecules. Indeed such processes are crucial in photosynthesis. Within this project, we aim to mimic the electron transfer processes of molybdenum enzymes by connecting Mo-centre mimics to electron transfer units, which can be activated by light. This will allow us to trigger the oxygenation reaction with a light flash and help us to learn more about the function of the enzymes. By using a variety of different molybdenum centres and photoactive units, we will identify the best combinations of components. Once the model systems are optimised, photoactivation may allow us to improve the energy and atom efficiency of industrially relevant oxidation processes and to oxygenate molecules related to DNA bases that are similar to the substrates of the molybdoenzyme xanthine oxidase.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the immediate benefit of advancing our understanding of fundamental photo-induced electron transfer processes in biomimetic catalysts, the proposed work may lead to the development of new photo-catalysts with the potential to improve the energy and atom efficiency of industrially relevant oxidation processes. Such oxidations represent a key step in the conversion of petroleum-based feedstocks to higher-value compounds of a higher oxidation state. Relevant reactions range from large-scale processes, such as the oxidation of aldehydes obtained by hydroformylation to carboxylic acids and the production of adipic acid required for the production of nylon-6.6 from cyclohexene to smaller-scale processes, such as the epoxidation of terpenes, e.g. limonene, for the production of fragrances. The fact that the proposed biomimetic photocatalysts use hydrogen peroxide (produced in situ from dioxygen) or water as clean oxidants is advantageous not only on environmental and economic grounds but also for safety reasons. In addition, catalysts with photonuclease activity may be identified, with potential applications in biochemical assays or photodynamic cancer therapy. The proposal is thus relevant to several areas identified as of strategic importance by the research councils, including green technology, sustainability, self-assembly and the priority theme energy. Hence, the work could have considerable economic and societal impact in the long-term. In order to ensure the commercial potential of promising catalysts, we will seek both intellectual property (IP) protection and industrial expertise. Help will be provided by the University of York Enterprise and Innovation Office 

Since the move towards greener chemical technology and energy efficiency is of much current interest and importance, the proposed work provides an opportunity to engage with the public and to raise awareness of environmental and sustainability issues. 

In addition, the work will result in the training of a highly skilled PDRA, who will be well prepared for employment in either the academic and industrial sector. In addition, new graduates and final year undergraduates working on related projects will benefit from the training provided.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>345804</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EuChemMS2015, 28 June-1 July 2015, Wroclaw, Poland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F70E03A-E992-4F4D-B9C1-8EA607D61767</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presentation entitled: 'Bio-inspired photoredox catalysis with molybdenum complexes'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d58419472332.16962850</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>COST 1003 WG4 meetings: Berlin 2013, Lund 2014, Lisbon 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FAAE1CA0-8113-4CAA-B745-563B04E61DC9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participation in working group discussions, networking.

In addition, they have been presented at five national and international conferences, both in form of poster and oral presentations.
The skills obtained by the PDRA and project students working on the project will benefit them and their future employers.
In addition, funding for a PhD studentship has been obtained that allows a continuation of the work.
Furthermore, an undergraduate miniproject based on oxo-Mo complexes was developed and incorporated in the practical programme. This helps to develop their practical skills and education in coordination chemistry.
Our publication entitled 'Light-induced activation of a molybdenum oxotransferase model within a Ru(II)-Mo(VI) dyad' has attracted much attention. It was selected as ACS editors choice article and shown as the most accessed paper in the journal 'Inorganic Chemistry' in November 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8B23BAAF-DBFF-4BF5-A673-1B573E007957</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cfd133451f8.11167676</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A series of cis-dioxo-molybdenum(VI) complexes was synthesised, characterised and tested for catalytic and photocatalytic oxygen-atom transfer activity. Representative examples of several classes of Mo(VI)-complexes known to catalyse biomimetic and industrially-relevant oxygen atom transfer reactions were investigated. The most promising complexes were those with thiosemicarbazone ligands, which allowed the redox properties of the catalysts to be optimised so as to allow for photo-activation by Ru-polypyridyl-based photosensitisers. Hence these complexes were fully characterised and their structural, electrochemical and photophysical properties were established in detail.

By covalently linking selected catalytically-active molybdenum complexes to Ru-based photosensitisers, dyads were obtained that mimic the overall design principle of the molybdoenzymes, in which spatially separated one-electron acceptors play a key role in the catalytic cycle. The dyads were fully characterised and their electrochemical and photophysical properties investigated.

The catalytic oxygen atom transfer activity of the resulting dyad-based photoredox catalysts as well as the corresponding two component systems was significantly enhanced upon irradiation with visible light. For example, turnover numbers of several hundreds were achieved for the oxygen atom transfer between triphenylphosphine and dimethylsulfoxide upon exposure to indirect sunlight. A significant, but less pronounced rate enhancement was observed when an analogous bimolecular system was tested, indicating that intramolecular electron transfer between the photosensitizer and the catalytic center is more efficient than intermolecular electron transfer between the separate components. In addition, the oxidation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid could be catalysed. Whilst photoactivation via oxidative quenching of a photoexcited Ru-centre usually requires the addition of a sacrificial electron acceptor, such as methylviologen, our system recycles methylviologen and hence only requires a catalytic amount of this expensive reagent.

The light-driven activation of water was also attempted and found possible in principle; however, turnover numbers were low since the catalytic oxo-molybdenum complex and photosensitiser combinations tested suffered from catalyst decomposition upon irradiation in both water-acetonitrile mixtures and aqueous buffer systems.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The synthetic procedures that were developed within the project can be utilised by other research groups that are interested in bioinorganic chemistry, coordination chemistry and catalysis. The coordinates for the crystal structures of novel Mo-complexes were deposited with the CCDC and are available to researchers interested in structural parameters.

The Mo(VI)-based catalysts, Ru(II)-based photosensitisers and the corresponding covalently-linked dyads can be synthesised by other researchers by following our published procedures and hence aid further investigations on related photocatalytic systems. In particular, the combination of oxo-Mo(VI) complexes and photosensitisers that we found to be suitable for photoactivation can be further developed and exploited.

Finally, the training received by the PDRA and project student working on the project will benefit them in their future careers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A8CBE3D3-523A-4DB5-B2B5-91A5036A2D76</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cfdb502c5d2.12452699</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/academic/d-g/a-kduhme-klair/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F3F5DAEB-BC5A-4039-A961-C09CA5F1EBB0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electronic Fine-Tuning of Oxygen Atom Transfer Reactivity of
