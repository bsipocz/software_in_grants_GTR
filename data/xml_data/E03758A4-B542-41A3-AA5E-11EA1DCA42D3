Around 85 per cent of machine operators in the sector are female, but managers are overwhelmingly male. The study evaluates, through a Randomized Control Trial, a Female Supervisor Training Program supported by the German overseas aid agency (GIZ) and developed with industry stakeholders. Mid-level management training is widely seen as needed in the Bangladeshi RMG sector, and thus the training program is targeted to sector-specific needs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research project provides supervisor training to 384 female and 96 male machine operators from 96 factories, with the aim of understanding the effect of both gender and training on a variety of outcomes. The first two outcomes are rates of trainee promotion and migration to other factories. Conditional on promotion, the project examines the management style of line supervisors, supervisee job satisfaction, and productivity -&amp;nbsp; including output, absenteeism and product quality. There is a potentially large demand for training in the sector, but also concerns among factory owners that trainees will leave the factory after completing training. The issue of migration has profound effects on demand for training and who optimally pays for the training.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will also have extensive impacts at the industry, firm and individual level. 

For the almost 600 women participating in the training program, there are direct impacts from the training obtained. Moreover, if the evaluation demonstrates that the program provides benefits beyond the program costs, we would expect the results to lead to adoption of the program by a larger number of firms. In that case, a much larger number of female production workers would benefit indirectly from the project. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the program will provide insights to those designing and running the program, which may result in program modifications and improvements. 

If the training program is found to be effective, producers participating in the project will benefit from increases in productivity either through greater output or through a reduction in output with quality defects. In that event, producers not participating in the project will also benefit. There is the potential for a powerful demonstration effect thereby more factories and buyers learn about the benefit of the program. 

Factories and buyers will also benefit from improved understanding of the factors that lead to higher productivity in the factory. 

The project will also benefit the international aid community, including government aid agencies (e.g., DFID), intergovernmental agencies (e.g., ILO), and non-governmental organizations. The randomized evaluation of the training program will provide credible evidence of whether this program works. We believe there will be some applicability of the results to similar programs in other countries or industries. The project is designed to increase the relevance to other training programs by studying the specific channels through which the program works. 

The effects on the participants will occur during the project and soon after. The broader effects from expansion of the training program will occur soon after the project is completed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>361028</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dhaka Dissemination workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC54DC19-BBE1-4801-A997-614D960350FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of project results to participating factories, industry associations, bilateral and mulitlateral aid agencies, and policy-makers in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d064ed8b7b70.17678416</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theigc.org/event/seminar-gender-equality-and-productivity-in-the-bangladeshi-garment-industry/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>20000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>CSR</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Sainsbury plc</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E15DB9A4-4F80-49E9-9D86-C67D8022A32C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d060e02a7f58.03982096</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>363147</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Improving Work Advancement POpportunities for Female RMG Workers</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>International Finance Corporation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>98433F05-C6D2-499B-9969-5B59F7F36A6C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5919c26f89f241.36722145</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has generated both direct and indirect impacts. The direct impacts are on the practices of the ready-made garment factories participating in the project. Among those factories, follow-up interviews reveal an Increased rate of promotion of females to supervisory role in the participant factories in the period beyond the project. Two factories indicated that they had formed all-female production lines, incorporating lessons of initial difficulties female supervisor trainees faced in managing male production workers. 

With regard to indirect effects, the clearest example is a follow-on project we are developing with the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to develop a module of the Better Works program aimed at developing a scalable intervention leading to increased promotion of females to supervisory roles. This work builds directly on the lessons learned from the ERSC-funded project. Understanding the three main constraints - selection of candidates, building confidence levels of the female candidates, and integrating trainees into the lines - allows us to focus the training to produce a more scalable product. Our conversations with ILO and IFC are at an advanced stage, and we are hopeful to begin working more formally on a project with them in the fall of 2016. 

The project PI has also participated in a meeting with the Secretary of State for International Development, Justine Greening, to help prepare her for her role in the UN High Level Panel on Women's Economic Empowerment. The discussion in that meeting, and follow-on work reviewing output from a recent conference at the Urban Institute, drew very much on the lessons learned from the ESRC-funded project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F2968D6C-4CB9-4CF9-A8E8-9BFF1CE164E7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d0633540f7a5.18727997</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The ready-made garment sector is the largest employer in Bangladesh, and has been a key sector for expanding labor market opportunities for women. But while 80 percent of sewing machine operators are female, only around 5 percent of managers are female. We sought to understand constraints to promotion of women to entry-level management positions, line supervisors. During the project, we worked with the German bilateral aid agency (GIZ) to provide training to 286 female and 131 males sewing machine operators from 80 factories to be line supervisors. 

The majority of factories with which we worked had at most one female supervisor at the start of the project. The training provided us the opportunity to observe reactions of existing managers and operators to female supervisors, with whom most have very limited experience. 

We consider the following three findings to be the most significant arising from the project:

1) Prior to training, employees at all levels of the factory believe that males outperform females as supervisors. We asked employees to rate males and females on eight characteristics which workers believe are the most important traits of managers. Relative to females, males are seen as particularly skilled at technical / machine knowledge and at organizing resources.
2) We conducted extensive skills diagnostic of female and male trainees. Objective measures of skills are not well correlated with the beliefs of workers described above. For example, an extensive diagnostic measuring machine knowledge indicates that males and females are equally skilled. 
3) When trainees return to the factory, machine operators working under the trainees initially indicate that the believe the males are better supervisors than the females. But after an exposure of approximately four months, the gender gap disappears. 

Thus, perceptions themselves are an important constraint to the promotion of females as supervisors, even when these perceptions do not match reality. 

There are two important questions on which the research is still on-going. The first is whether there are productivity differences between the male and female trainees working as supervisors. We have collected very detailed production data from the factories, and are presently processing and harmonizing those data so that an appropriate analysis can be conducted. The second question is whether participating factories changed their hiring and promotion practices after exposure to the project. We are presently contacting the factories to ask about promotion patterns in the period after their participation in the project. 

Finally, we would highlight one other output from the project, not directly related to the training. We have collected what we believe is the most detailed data of productivity among manufacturers in a low-income country. The data will be valuable for understanding productivity in the sector more broadly - potentially not only in Bangladesh but in other countries, through related collection elsewhere. Once fully anonymised and harmonized, these data will be made available to the research community more broadly.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have produced a report which has been provided to foreign buyers working in the sector and is being delivered to all of the participating factories. We continue to work with many stakeholders i the sector, both to disseminate the results of this project and on follow-on projects. We believe the results of these efforts will be cumulative. As we develop stronger relationships with key stakeholders, research results will be considered more carefully.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DC29565D-0D38-4962-99BC-E51C0BB84704</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>558d0c8da316e5.81959203</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D3FD2F17-5F27-4675-886C-5661D76D05C1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Challenges of Change: An Experiment Training Women to Manage in the Bangladeshi Garment Sector</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9fa8916b9ac5592d1e738cf846c5cc69"><gtr:id>9fa8916b9ac5592d1e738cf846c5cc69</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Macchiavello, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d06d85db4ad7.69294071</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E53CC9CB-177A-4DC3-B04D-8E497DD58D1C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Managing for Efficiency in the Garment Sector</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5463a0ac972b048cb08d6c2daf8fa73d"><gtr:id>5463a0ac972b048cb08d6c2daf8fa73d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woodruff, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d0700f1df3d7.56574392</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4FED1751-FD0E-4E8D-923C-D927240D48E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gender empowerment and productivity in the garment sector</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5463a0ac972b048cb08d6c2daf8fa73d"><gtr:id>5463a0ac972b048cb08d6c2daf8fa73d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woodruff, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d06ec4d10cd3.94229841</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J009466/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
