Very little is known of the processes that were involved in medieval map-making, yet as visual objects maps such as the one which is the focus of this study - the Gough Map of Great Britain - they continue to fascinate and mystify modern audiences. The Gough Map is the earliest to show the whole of Britain in geographically-recognizable form, and is conventionally dated to c.1360. Yet, despite its appearance in television programmes, book covers, learned articles and so forth, the map's origins are uncertain, including who made it, how, where and why? This project seeks to address these questions by using an innovative approach to explore the map's 'linguistic geographies', that is the writing used on the map by the (unknown) scribes who created it. This technique involves specialist palaeographic and linguistic skills that are normally applied to text manuscripts, but with this project they are being tried on a map manuscript, somewhat experimentally, with the aim of not only finding more about the Gough Map's making but also the transferability of particular methods from linguistic to cartographic history.\n\nThe project involves a group of researchers from across three UK HEIs, each bringing distinctive skills and expertise to bear. Each has an interest in maps and mapping, though from differing disciplinary perspectives, from geography, cartography and history. Their aim is to learn more about the Gough Map, specifically, but more generally to contribute to ongoing intellectual debates about how maps can be read and interpreted; about how maps are created and disseminated across time and space; and about technologies of collating and representing geographical information in visual, cartographic form. The project's focus on a map, as opposed to a conventional written text, will also open up theoretical and conceptual issues about the relationships between 'image' and 'text' - for maps comprise both - and about maps as objects and artifacts with a complex and complicated 'language' of production and consumption. Far from being geared simply to academic questions, however, the project team is keen to ensure that their findings reach the widest possible audience, not least because maps are enduringly popular objects and always capture the imagination; medieval maps especially. To this end one of the main project outcomes is a web-resource through which the Gough Map will be made more widely accessible (it currently resides in the Bodleian Library), and through which the data and findings of this project will be made freely available. This will help others to develop the research, whether in academic or non-academic sectors. As well as the web-resource, the project will provide the basis for a public exhibition on the Gough Map, to be held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, at which a colloquium will provide a forum for discussion on the language and linguistics of medieval maps and mapping.\n\nThe project will run for a period of fifteen months and during this time the principal research will be undertaken at the Bodleian Library on the manuscript of the Gough Map. The methods used will in particular reveal new insight into the map's creation, especially on the locales or geographical origins of the scribes who wrote down the names, descriptions, and toponyms on that appear on the map. Recent research on the map's geographical distortion has suggested that the south-east of England is most accurately depicted, suggesting that this might have been where the map was drawn. If so, it might be expected that the writing on the map reflects the dialects of this part of England. The only way of finding this out is through the systematic and careful analysis of the map's writing as proposed here. Once done, these findings will help reveal where and how medieval maps were made, contributing to our greater understanding of European medieval cultures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>117992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition: The Gough Map: 'the most remarkable cartographic monument of medieval England'&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>542F1FBD-B4E5-43DB-BEF1-34F9C0FEB97B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition containing the Gough Map manuscript and project interpretation

In achieving this, the project has also made three key research contributions: 1. an historical re-interpretation of the Gough Map, 2. the development of a transferable model for cartographic criticism, and 3. the development of a new Open Source tool for viewing maps online: 

1. Only through a close and systematic study of the writing on the Gough Map has some of its secrets become exposed. Most important is our scrutiny of what appears to be the earliest writing on the map. Conventionally the map has been dated to around 1360, though lately one researcher has suggested instead that an early-fifteenth century date is more likely. The research carried out by our project has shown a more complicated picture, with some of the map's writing dating to around the 1370s, although by no means all. There is evidence of a later over-writing of some place-names that shows a continued interest in and use of the Gough Map into the later fifteenth century. Moreover, in this 'freshening up' of the map's inscriptions there is a distinct geographical bias towards England and Wales, for Scotland's place-names are left alone. This raises questions then of the map's significance as a visual depiction of an English island-realm, and its reflection of changing political relations between England and Scotland a century on from when the map appears to have been first composed. Key to such observations is the project's immensely rich analysis of the map's writing, particularly the 600-plus place-names that appear on it, which forms the basis of the project's web-resource.

2. Since many historic maps are not available in modern editions (and some have never been edited at all), scholars are faced with a challenge of producing such editions in order to make the rich artistic, scientific and historical content of maps accessible to an academic and wider community. At present, however, there is little certainty as to what a scholarly edition of a map should comprise. Maps present exceptionally difficult problems for textual criticism due to their unique fusion of pictorial and textual material. As a highly damaged document, with at least two non-contemporary layers of content, the Gough Map presents particular interpretative and editorial challenges. From working through the map's visual and textual content, however, Linguistic Geographies has succeeded in establishing a model of what a scholarly edition of a highly complex medieval map can achieve, which is of benefit to others engaged in similar studies. 

3. As important in this regard has been the developmental work required to create a viewable interactive version of the Gough Map, linked to the historical data used in the palaeographical and linguistic analysis of the map. The wide usage of web-distributed digital maps, via popular platforms such as Google maps, is clear evidence of the level of public engagement with and expectations of online cartography. However, a large and complex manuscript map-image such as the Gough Map presents considerable technical challenges that have to be met to enable users to use the map interface both easily and seamlessly. To this end, as part of the project's research, a new image viewer has been developed, made available as an Open Source tool. This not only provides the necessary means for making the Linguistic Geographies web-resource easy and interesting to use, but has already been adopted for use by other organisations in serving images online (eg. Oxford University Computing Services). 

Over the course of 15-months research, then, the project has created new insights into how maps work - visually and textually - as both images and texts - in both contemporary and historical contexts. These insights and their significance are further discussed in a recorded interview commissioned by the Beyond Text programme, and conducted at the project's conclusion, in which Keith Lilley (PI) and Elizabeth Solopova (PDRA) reflect on the major findings of Linguistic Geographies, the interview being made available online via YouTube (at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj9pxq27VBU), as well as via the Beyond Text web-site (http://projects.beyondtext.ac.uk/video.php).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Heritage / library management; TV/Radio; popular / local history</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5671342D-D496-4652-942F-14C6EDB0101B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6918215674.272008775b82ec</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.goughmap.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6A3C885E-E579-43B2-824F-963E343BEA3C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping Plantagenet rule through the Gough Map of Great Britain</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c97c6101a326e224bd9d5609ec2892be"><gtr:id>c97c6101a326e224bd9d5609ec2892be</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lilley K D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542e8191682535.26412902</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F7A17755-57B0-45A1-A819-27BD6D764197</gtr:id><gtr:title>Envisioning Landscapes, Making Worlds: Geography and the Humanities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f1e71c2f3e46d0a66a018e4ad5c7fa99"><gtr:id>f1e71c2f3e46d0a66a018e4ad5c7fa99</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Daniels, Stephen; DeLyser, Dydia; Entrikin, J.
