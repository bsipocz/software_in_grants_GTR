In the 150 year history of the country as a nation state, communities identified as Italian have formed all over the world, while in the last 30 years Italy has also become a destination country for migrants from a variety of national, religious and ethnic backgrounds. All these communities have shaped the way in which 'Italianness' is understood within the nation and beyond its confines, while contributing to the formation of local identities in linguistic and cultural contexts markedly different from Italy.

The project will examine the forms of mobility that have defined the development of modern Italian culture and its interactions with other cultures across the globe. It will concentrate on a series of exemplary cases, representative of the geographic, historical and linguistic map of Italian mobility. It will look at the Italian communities established in the UK, the US, Australia, South America; at colonial settlement in Africa; and at the migrant communities in contemporary Italy.

Focussing on the cultural associations that each community has formed, the project will examine the wealth of publications and materials - journals, literature, life stories, photographs, collections of memorabilia, and other forms of representation - that are associated with these organizations. It will investigate the processes of translation that are evident at every level of the communities in question and that characterize all the textual/ visual material associated with them. It will analyse the significance of the choice of writing in the language of the host community or in that of the country of origin; the hybridization of linguistic codes. It will focus on the circulation of texts and materials within the communities themselves and beyond, examining the impact they have on notions of national identity.

At the same time as the project develops insights into transnational Italian cultures, it will produce a new framework for the discipline of Modern Languages as a whole, one which sees the study of the interaction of cultures as its most essential characteristic. The project will bring together researchers from the different subject areas of Modern Languages and show the importance of the connection with research in other arts and social science disciplines. In order to achieve this aim, the project will produce a major work of scholarship on the theory and practice of cultural translation, a reader on culture and translation for students of Modern Languages and a website which functions as a hub for related work on this theme. It will also serve to enhance public understanding of Modern Languages by fostering public debate between discipline specialists and policy makers.

The research outputs are intended to produce new frameworks to address contemporary concerns regarding linguistic/ geographical/ cultural mobility, they will serve an important pedagogical function, and will be of clear benefit to the wider community. They consist of five edited volumes, explicitly intended to further new methods of studying national languages and cultures and their inter-relation; three workshops; two international conferences and an exhibition to be staged at a variety of international locations; the website will provide an interactive context for the above publications and activities. The highly inter-disciplinary nature of the PhD and post-doctoral projects are intended to prepare a new generation of researchers in advancing skills of inter-cultural and inter-lingual awareness. The inter-disciplinary nature of the project, its addressing of new resources and its establishment of new research frameworks which locate translation and mobility at the centre of the study of contemporary cultures. The dissemination of the outputs is designed to take place at every level of secondary and higher education and to have clear public policy implications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Transnational Italies has two broad aims: to write an alternative history of Italy since Unification, and reposition Modern Languages within the Academy. The concept and practice of cultural translation as we define it will have enormous global cultural and social impact, and make an exemplary contribution to a discipline in crisis.
Primary Beneficiaries
1. Members of the Italian community associations we work with include: St Peter's Italian Church (London), CO.AS.IT (Melbourne), Archivio memorie migranti (Rome), Patronato ACLI Brasile (Sao Paolo), Club Juventus (Addis Abeba)

We have identified less formal networks in Scotland and Argentina. We will use the existing networks of bodies such as the Italian Cultural Institute (London) and the Calandra Institute (New York) to engage with Italian communities in these locations. 

Association members will provide primary material for the bilingual output: Italy Elsewhere, and for the exhibition series. Their active collaboration in producing outputs will generate reflection on family and community histories of change and continuity. Attendance at memory/art workshops, or theatre events with people outside the Italian community will lead to a contextualisation of processes of cultural exchange. Through the public validation of their contribution to the construction of a vernacular Italian national culture. Through Facebook and Twitter, their local experience will be placed in a global perspective. 

2. Members of the communities in which the associations are located

The Project extends beyond the Italian heritage community to involve the general public in questions of translation and cultural diversity. Other linguistic communities will be addressed as active participants in events. The writing workshops facilitated by Shirin Ramzanali Fazel will be directed to any non-native speaker of English interested in creative writing. Art workshops will explore issues of translation through the creative adaptation of artistic techniques from different cultures. The photographic recall workshops explore photography as a way of creating cultural narratives. Theatre events in the UK as well as in Melbourne will be open public events.

3. Secondary School pupils

Transnational Italies will revise the place and function of Modern Languages in schools. The integration of 'Translating Cultures' activities into the Scottish S1-S3 curriculum will be assessed through written and verbal feedback from students and teachers. Samples of work will be collated and regarded as qualitative feedback. The experience at Drummond will result in the production in App integrating translation across the Humanities curriculum. The App will allow the project to feed into the English school curriculum, facilitated by school liaison contacts at Warwick and Bristol. 


4. Public bodies 

Transnational Italies stresses the importance of cultural translation in policy making and the delivery of public services. For many government bodies and NGOs translation is essential. We will involve agencies such as the Refugee Council to examine how such bodies understand and use translation. An NGO representative will join the Advisory Board. We will produce a series of information documents on aspects of 'Cultural translation in public practice' for distribution to public bodies. 

Summary of Impact:
a. Recognize the complex and strategic role of translation in everyday cultural encounters
b. Enhance understandings of the value of translation in its multiple forms as a means of maintaining and inventing cultural tradition and identity
c. Validate a bicultural experience and history
d. Foster an understanding of cultural production as a key site of identity creation and change
e. Facilitate a creative engagement with diverse cultural traditions
f. Further social cohesion in a multilingual context
g. Inform the policy of public bodies in relation to translation and cultural identity</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1490812</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of prints by S3 pupils at Drummond CHS based on textile designs from their families' countries of origin.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9AB145F0-7737-4FCB-B30B-590004D78870</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Part of the work of the project with community schools in Edinburgh.

Participants from a wide range of cultural backgrounds produced multimedia books exploring their individual histories using the different media to explore.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Italian Historical Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>IHS/Co.As.It</gtr:description><gtr:id>C46F4AB2-E50A-40FF-BB3E-8EFFAF8D79F1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>If successful, the application will develop an online interactive multimedia resource for the Italian Historical Society oral history database</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460ecb9df34f6.57424367-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>See Above</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Paolo Baracchi (Italian Historical Society/Co.As.It) and Rita Wilson (Monash): application submitted Nov 2014 to the Local History Grants Program (Public Record Office of Victoria) to develop an online interactive multimedia resource for the IHS oral history database (a collection of approximately 300 interviews conducted among Italians in Australia during the 1980s and 1990s)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arnhem Wharf Primary School</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Arnhem Wharf primary School</gtr:description><gtr:id>B4E778F2-BB80-4A04-9124-56A23567537E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The contribution is in the material that was used for the course design and provision of Italian teaching.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc26e0300f9.99670094-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Georgia Wall (PhD student Warwick) using ideas and material from the project contributed to designing material for teaching in Arnhem Wharf primary school.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Course design and provision of material for Italian classes (after-school, for children Yr. 3- 5) 6th Jan - 23rd March 2016</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lampedusa in Hamburg</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Lampedusa in Hamburg</gtr:description><gtr:id>A896A1DF-7FC5-4D8E-83CF-457F9E36C776</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration will feed directly into the doctoral study that Colombini is undertaking for the project and it will be a part of the research outcomes that are envisaged by the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d7324962fef1.19612762-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Colombini is also supporting and collaborating with local activists and refugees groups for the organization of the first International Conference of Refugee and Migrants in Hamburg (he took part in the mobilization tour in the refugee camps in Hamburg).

2. Art: a mural mapping Craigmiller (the estate where the school is located) in the world. The project will be delivered for the Creative Industries National 5 qualification). Pupils will document their research pathway as a contribution to the project website. The project has already attracted the interested of local community groups and may be expanded. 

3. An interdisciplinary project on Italy working with a small group of pupils who are being taught outside the normal curriculum as they have particular learning needs. The group is working on the creation of an 'Italian wall' in a designated classroom and are planning a range of other activities including food and a small community based oral history project using mini ipads.

In recent years there has been a significant increase in uptake of the Masters program in Illustration and Graphic Design at ECA. We have always had an international group, however the differences (and similarities) have been made more apparent by the rise in numbers. We think this is good, and interesting for student projects of course, in the way it foregrounds current socio-political situations, but can also give them an intense experience in dealing with such matters in a protective and productive environment.
This project 'Transnational Identity' is a timely opportunity for students to develop their personal ideas in relation to the diverse flavour of the Masters group and also in response to international concerns.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56de8e9e430541.21670242-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Edinburgh College of Art has facilitated the work of Carlo Pirozzi for the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>An aspect of the work of Carlo Pirozzi on 'Transnational identity' was selected by the Graphic Design and Illustration Department of Edinburgh College of Art.

This workshop brought together local and international policy-makers, practitioners and experts to share their experiences from both their personal and professional practices in relation to sites of linguistic and cultural exchange.
Practitioners and policy-makers included:
-Councillor Barry Henley for Brandwood Ward, Birmingham (also Chair of Governors at Oldknow Academy, Birmingham)
-Mark Hinton, Community Engagement Officer, University of Warwick
-Tsjerk Bottema, Senior Policy Advisor, Language, Education and Culture Department - Province of Friesland, The Netherlands
-Shirin Ramzanali Fazel, published writer in Italian and English
-Birgit Harris, Community Access to Schools Development Worker (South), Liberton High 
-Michele Righini, Director of the Casa di Khaoula Public Library in Bologna, Italy.
Feedback from the day (see below) demonstrated the success in encouraging all participants (from both beyond and within academia) to reflect on the central, but typically neglected, role of language and culture in society, as well as thinking about new ways to respond to multilingual and multicultural realities in practice and in policy. Policy-makers and practitioners from a range of contexts and backgrounds were encouraged to reflect in greater depth on the role of language and culture in their work and how it can influence their future practices. The ongoing dialogue initiated with policy makers and practitioners at the workshop is also informing the development of the project as we pursue both our research and our partnerships and engagement with non-academic audiences.

General comments
? An excellent workshop - highly interesting. Keep asking questions of these kinds
? Probably the most interesting conference I've ever been to.
? I found it very informative and enriching. 
? The workshop last Friday was very interesting and informative.
? It was a pleasure to take part in the workshop on Linguistic and Cultural Interchange last Friday! It was an interesting program, with language theory, practice and policy all coming together in one.
? I work in teacher education and consider multilingualism to be an area in which most teachers lack knowledge in.
Ideas or points will take away from the day 
? Language plays a key role in policy making.
? Language is a multi sensory and multi modal experience
? Need to change lang. teaching in universities.
? Diversity of expression of identity
? Language as a multi-sensory experience
? Activities related to language can be a way of community-building.
? There is a need for policy &amp;amp; research to integrate a lot more. 
? The multimodal &amp;amp; multi-sensory approach to translation &amp;amp; translanguaging should inform Policy &amp;amp; Research. 
? The role of museums &amp;amp; libraries in the representation of &amp;quot;locals&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;migrants&amp;quot; lives.
? Language compartmentalization must be overcomed in pedag. contexts.
? Emphasis on practice - what people do not how they are defined. 
? Collaboration outside academia in conception of research.
? Importance of the role of schools in creating a real multilingual environment. 
? Realizing policies in practices.
? Affective/emotional dimension of multilingualism.
? Language learning is always a multimodal experience but language teaching seldom is.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d734231de562.58489183</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.transnationalmodernlanguages.ac.uk/2016/01/26/linguistic-and-cultural-interchange-workshop-university-of-warwick/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Being Human Festival, St Andrews, November 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCAA51CF-B3D6-447B-AA79-CB72B29FE0C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The one day series of workshops funded as part of the 'Being Human: festival in the humanities' initiative looked at the representation of migrants to Italy in a range of cultural forms.

A seminar by Monica Bandella and Zakaria Mohamed Ali focussed on practices of translation of migrant testimony. Mario Badagliacca discussed the ethics of photographing inside migrant detention centres. Gameli Tordzro of PanAfrican Arts in Glasgow discussed practices of video filmmaking with Alessandro Triulzi.There was a screening of Dagmawi Yimer's documentary film 'Va pensiero', an exploration of racism in Italy today. The exhibition of Badagliacca's work lasted for a further two weeks. Overall the workshops aimed to counteract stereotypical media representations of migrants.

Speakers included members of the team and leading experts on Italian mobilities, in addition to practitioners in the creative arts. In particular, an interactive workshop was organized with the Cantieri Meticci migrant and refugee theatre company from Bologna, providing an opportunity for the students and team to explore instances of transnational and multilingual creative practices. The theatre company is also directly involved in my own research and the workshop consequently also allowed for ongoing collaboration with them for the project. 
Feedback from the participants demonstrates the direct influence of the Summer School on the development of PhD students' current research ideas and progress, as well as on their future research plans and careers. In particular, the Summer School allowed the team to effectively share and develop their conceptualization of Transnational Italian Studies with a wider community of scholars based in Italian Departments across the globe.
Feedback:
? The Summer School resulted in an enlightening multi-disciplinary learning experience, and I came away from it with new insight into my own research and methodologies. 
? It has been a very rewarding experience, providing valuable input as well as interesting conversation with people with similar interests.
? The &amp;quot;Transnationalizing Modern Language&amp;quot; project is, I believe, very important and timely in producing a specific outlook on contemporary Italy that Italy now needs more than ever.
? It is possible that I would be, at some point in the next future, drafting applications to pursue further research, and the multiple viewpoints offered by the summer school will be crucial in this. 
? I have found the research surgeries most useful, providing me with very valuable input and performing very well as a sounding board to my ideas.
? This rather unique opportunity of discussing the first draft of my new project with such relevant Italian-American studies scholars, as well as with such experts in transnational studies, significantly enriched my comparative methodology in a transnational perspective
? The chance to discuss and ask questions in an actively participatory context (facilitated even further by the group activities, especially the theatre) also stimulated questions for me more specifically related to language, and this is something that has already impacted on my own research, encouraging me to make new contacts and utilize new networks.
? I really enjoyed the entire Summer School and I found it very useful. In particular, I have loved the experience at the 'Biennale' and the idea of applying the same processes that I normally use to analyse literary sources to works of art; from this I got a couple of ideas that I would like to develop in the future. Moreover, I thought that the master classes were brilliant and that they provided original ways of investigating the theme of mobility.
? The contribution of academics and PhD students with different backgrounds presenting their own approach to the study of Italian history, art, culture, and society, and the inclusion in the programme of seminars and activities focused on different forms of art provided a concrete example of the relevance of interdisciplinarity, and its richness and strength. 
? The complexity of reality and human experience calls for a great diversity, inclusiveness, and flexibility in terms of disciplinary approaches and objects of study, if academic research aims at accounting for reality and being responsive to it. I think this summer school really managed to convey that.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d735810b2ab9.00210305</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.transnationalmodernlanguages.ac.uk/2016/01/25/transnational-italian-studies-summer-school-venice-2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at ECArTE, Palermo, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FDEC49E9-227D-4C38-9347-966413712B2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Margaret Hills de Zarate presented the methodologies behind her work at the Palermo Academy of Art (ECArTE), Italy (40 participants) Paper selected as one of 15 presentations to be published by ECArTE) European Consortium for Arts Therapies Education.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddbcbba1f251.62629570</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ecarte.info/conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>iMean 4 Conference, Warwick, April 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D27BDA0E-50E4-48DD-BB80-A50BA4688D7A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>iMean 4 Conference workshop on 'Language and Mobility/Language's Mobility: Interdisciplinary Perspectives', University of Warwick, 8 April 2015 (Co-convened by Naomi Wells (Warwick) and Marco Santello (Leeds).

The day of creative exchanges at Birmingham's Ikon Gallery explored how in multicultural communities we translate and transact between languages when we express experiences and emotions and listen to the stories others tell. In the morning, there were performances and readings from a multilingual group of Birmingham-based writers, followed by an afternoon drop-in workshop which invited the public to bring the words they each associate with feelings of hope and fear. Small groups then engaged in collaborative writing by sharing their words and ideas to produce together short pieces of writing. The event gave us the opportunity to share some of the writing produced in the workshops with a wider public, with audio and video recordings of the readings also made available online. The audience, which filled the room, were extremely enthusiastic in their response with many also staying to participate in the afternoon workshop, which allowed us to bring our workshop experience to a much wider audience. Participants described it as an 'inspiring' and 'enriching' event, and were keen to be involved in any future related activities, demonstrating the success and clear potential to further develop the creative writing workshops into a long-term programme of activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b829680ba866.68382022</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://writingacrossblog.wordpress.com/2017/01/16/familiar-strangers-being-human-festival-november-2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation University of Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4B75E6C-A3A0-439E-A51A-F29E6E15BEB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Together with other PhD students from different institutions, Iacopo Colombini (St. Andrews) facilitated the workshop on 'Politics of Representation' at the first Edinburgh Conference in Critical Migration and Border Studies, 'Politics, Practices, and Discourse of Mobility'.

He highlighted themes relevant for his research: the role of the collective memory; strategies to challenge media/politics hegemonic migrants representation; use of aesthetic for self-representation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5ecb1bf44e6.10938426</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.globaljusticeacademy.ed.ac.uk/news/politics,_practices,_and_discourses_of_mobility</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stills Gallery</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F4BDFCCA-CD60-4AD9-BB87-702928DA2840</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interest in the project and the relevance of the questions explored in the project to people's lives in contemporary Scotland.

They have attracted new and experienced writers from diverse backgrounds in the West Midlands keen to explore with us how they respond creatively to living in a multilingual and multicultural environment. The workshops were led by writer Shirin Ramzanali Fazel who has published novels and short stories in Italian and English, and focused on how we bridge gaps and move across languages and cultures in our lives. 
The first series of three workshops took place at Sandwell Arts Caf&amp;eacute; in West Bromwich in May 2015, working in partnership with the Arts Manager for Sandwell Council. Six writers from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds joined us for the workshops, sharing new and original writing produced during the series (see example published here on our website: http://www.transnationalmodernlanguages.ac.uk/2015/09/07/familiar-strangers-a-poem-by-femi-abidogun/). After the workshops we maintained ongoing contact with the participants, and three of the writers have rejoined us for our second series of workshops currently running in Birmingham.
This second series of workshops was designed after talking and meeting again with the participants from the first workshops to ensure ongoing collaboration. The workshops have moved to a more central location in central Birmingham and have consequently attracted significant interest from a large group of new and experienced writers from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds and nationalities (Croatia, Bulgaria, France, Nigeria etc.). The first two workshops have been a major success in terms of attendance with 10-12 writers at each workshop (the majority of participants plan to continue across the series but with some flexibility for those unable to attend all sessions). We have also recently created a blog for the workshops, where the participants have begun to share their reflections and writing, demonstrating the enthusiastic response to the content of the workshops: https://writingacrossblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/09/workshop-1-words-and-voices-wednesday-3rd-february/#comments.
 The continuation of participants, particularly three of the writers who've stayed in close contact with us since the first series of workshops last May and with the change in locations, also demonstrates the value of the workshops for participants as they develop their writing. As this new series of workshops continues until June 2016, we aim to continue to focus on developing further opportunities for participants to share their work more widely outside of the group, including plans for publication and participation in public arts festivals.
The workshops are also directly influencing my own research for the project, particularly in relation to the construction of intercultural spaces which allow for the creative negotiation of linguistic and cultural differences. Bridging these experiences in research and practice will inform the future development of my research and impact-related activities, particularly in relation to making research and teaching in Modern Languages relevant to wider audiences.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d80b0cbe77e2.22215192</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.transnationalmodernlanguages.ac.uk/2015/09/07/familiar-strangers-a-poem-by-femi-abidogun/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation in Hong Kong</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FEC8F56A-A192-4399-9A13-D5D170221E95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Together with T.

The workshops explore creative responses to living in a multilingual and multicultural environment, and the most recent series (January-June 2016) took place at the Ikon Gallery in central Birmingham. The participants came from a diverse range of linguistic and cultural backgrounds, including writers based in Birmingham but originally from countries including Nigeria, Croatia, France, Somalia and Iran. The workshops have led to the establishment of ongoing collaborative relationships with a core group of highly engaged writers, leading specifically to the Being Human performance (see below) and contributions from the writers to the project exhibitions. Those who took part described the workshops as 'highly rewarding', 'a wonderful, encouraging atmosphere' and 'one of the most enjoyable projects I took part in'. They have also told us how the workshops have begun to directly influence their own writing, for example by encouraging them to experiment with writing in different languages in their work. The workshops also led to the establishment of the formal partnership with the Ikon Gallery listed under collaborations. More generally, the workshops have influenced the research of the members of the project team who took part, particularly in the development of more participatory and collaborative models of co-produced research which have been presented to the wider academic community through a number of conference presentations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b828635a4685.42246545</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://writingacrossblog.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation, University of Swansea, May 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3FF769D3-6578-4214-B17E-C0B4A89BBE1A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Charles Burdett (Bristol) and Naomi Wells (Warwick), presented the seminar 'Transnationalizing Modern Languages: Mobility, Translation and Identity in Modern Italian Cultures', invited research seminar , University of Swansea, 6 May 2015.

Accompanied with the project exhibition, it shed new light on the history of Italian cultural mobility. It explored how the notion of 'Italianness' has been dynamically reformulated and performed by individual and collective subjects drawing from ideas of the nation state and its regimes of citizenship, from transcultural practices and transnational imaginaries. It set out to broaden the frame in which we read Italian history, memory and culture, considering the multiple levels of their negotiation, mediation and remediation. It aimed to stress the fluid and relational nature of (Italian) culture and belonging, by investigating events, media and memories through which they have been materialised, imagined and performed.
The conference had a capacity list of participants from locations across the world. It was a key event in disseminating the aims of the project and in encouraging the participation of researchers from a wide international range.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7b6ff762366.95323845</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.transnationalmodernlanguages.ac.uk/2017/01/09/tml-conference-transnational-italies-bsr-at-rome-2016-on-youtube/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Event at the British Academy 26 February 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B411FAC0-4F2A-4959-87A7-8FCFC94BF213</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On Friday 26 February 2016 the British Academy hosted an event organized as part of the project, 'Transnationalizing Modern Languages: Mobility, Identity and Translation in Modern Italian Cultures' (AHRC large grant, 2014-2017) http://www.transnationalmodernlanguages.ac.uk/ . The event presented the work that the project is accomplishing within Higher Education, within schools and within the wider community. Its aim was to provide a forum in which to discuss how we can reshape the discipline of Modern Languages for the 21st century. 
The feedback from the day demonstrates the huge enthusiasm for the work which the project is undertaking in HE and beyond, as well as the way core ideas and principles established in research and practice by the project team were actively taken up by the audience members. In particular, comments demonstrated clear intentions to put the ideas presented by the project team into use in participants' own practices in research, teaching and wider engagement beyond and within HE. Equally, feedback shows how successfully the core aim of the project to demonstrate the centrality of Modern Languages across disciplines and sectors was demonstrated to the large audience present.
Feedback:
What three new ideas or questions will you take away from today in relation to the role of Modern Languages in HE and beyond?
? It's not just about languages in HE. It's about languages in all sectors.
? That there is very substantial material beginning to appear to help Departments refocus curricula in the form of the transnationalizing volumes.
? The openness, humanity and examples of pupils and teachers from Castlebrae. Thank you.
? introduce 1st year module showing role French/French people/francophone people have played in Wales.
? importance of responsive/two-way process when researching with practitioners
? need to teach beyond and between narrow national (and ever-changing) borders
? That we must emphasise ML work in our own communities to ensure its relevance.
? I liked the idea of challenging other fields in their perception of what it is to be a linguist. Before explaining it to the public, which is of course the aim, institutions themselves must understand the importance of the field and its interdisciplinarity.
? The way that language specific studies can function as a model for interdisciplinary studies more generally.
? The role/metaphor of multilinguality as a mode of all sorts of different kinds of research + practice.
? Who are the experts in transcultality? People operating translinguistically every day.
? very important work with children in underprivileged areas, language is key to culture
? Practise sharing. I would like to introduce the creative writing task &amp;quot;my favourite word&amp;quot; to my students
? The need to develop a coherent identity for ML students + make sure they grasp the rationale behind their degree.
? The importance of making MLs a fully inclusive subject
? The importance of affect &amp;amp; emotion in how we research and teach this
? The power of creative writing workshops in exploring identities/cultures/languages and discovering new messages/connections/ways of seeing the world.
? Idea of using traditional ML subjects as a spring board in the thinking about how languages function in the wider community seems very promising
? Multilingual turn in the disciplinary area
? Approaching school teachers who do not teach who do not teach languages with the idea/concept of translating cultures across the curriculum
? The idea of a post-monolingual world
? the &amp;quot;wider picture&amp;quot; and how we could re-structure our language modules to respond to this
? how to engage pedagogically with the translingual.
? How to pursue the inclusion of language learning with other disciplines
? Transfer learning from today to direct work with refugees
? Support &amp;amp; leadership of HE in shaping and promoting the importance of culture &amp;amp; languages from early stages in schools.

General comments:
? The school example was hugely inspiring!
? V. stimulating workshop.
? Thank you for a wonderful session!
? Inspirational day -thank you!

It looked also at the subject of multilingualism and community language courses run by migrant cultural associations in the nearby city of Bologna. The audience was mostly made up of school teachers and the team was able to discuss and receive feedback from them on possible implications of the project's research for institutions such as schools in Italy, in relation to the the need to recognize the multilingual resources of students and to challenge the monolingual focus of education in Italy and beyond. The activity also included an exhibition of art work that the project is pursuing with community schools in Edinburgh.

The conferences have been accompanied by the exhibition of the project, 'Beyond Borders: Oltre i Confini' that presents the research of the project through multimedia installations. The exhibitions have been very successful and in 2017 there will be further exhibitions in other parts of the world. One of the key aims of TML is to produce innovative models for the way in which we think about culture, belonging and identity in a transnational world. The major events in 2016 have had a clear importance in encouraging new ways of thinking about transcultural identity and practice. The publications of TML will develop and disseminate the approaches to cultural identity and translation that lie at the heart of the project.

As indicated above, a key aim of the project is to produce a new framework for the study of Modern Languages in Higher Education - a matter of very considerable importance given the declining national provision of the subject at a time of ever accelerating globalization. Working closely with Liverpool University Press, the project is producing a series of texts that will explore key concepts of the transcultural and which will show how its study can be addressed and pursued not only in Italian studies but in French, German, Hispanic, Portuguese and Russian studies. The intention is for this model to be expanded beyond the core disciplines that currently define Modern Languages in Higher Education. The series will have a major impact on the development of Modern Languages in HE and thus develop a core impact of the project.

The work that TML is pioneering in community schools in Edinburgh and through its writing workshops in the West Midlands has been hugely successful. The model that is being developed indicates how skills and knowledge transfer can be accomplished through practices of inter-linguistic transfer. It has already attracted the interest of government agencies in Scotland and Wales and the project will explore how the models with which it is experimenting can be scaled up both laterally and nationally. Members of the team have also engaged with teaching practice in primary, secondary and higher education in Italy.

TML organized a major event at the British Academy on 26 February 2016. The event presented the work that the project is accomplishing within Higher Education, within schools and within the wider community. Its aim was to provide a forum in which to discuss how we can reshape the discipline of Modern Languages for the 21st century. The event was sold out and was distinguished by the quality of the discussion on how Modern Languages can develop in a world that is increasingly defined by mobility, multilingualism, and the pace of globalization. The audience was made up of both specialists and non-specialists and a key topic of conversation concerned how the model of the project is developing can be disseminated as widely as possible.

The event followed on from the three workshops that were organized in 2015 on public policy, pedagogy and methodology. All of which have addressed wide audiences and which have been concerned with key areas of practice.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8D26E127-61F3-4C13-B289-0FAF87BD173B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546390a14d2bf4.85139787</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project (TML) has now been running for three years and it has met and exceeded its objectives for this stage. The first objective of TML is to explore ways in which we can study Italian culture not simply as a phenomenon linked geographically to the idea of the nation state but as a global phenomenon that has changed and developed as it has been in constant contact with other cultures across the globe. Researchers are investigating specific moments in the histories of the Italian communities established in the UK, the US, Australia, South America, Africa and of the migrant communities of contemporary Italy. Focusing on the cultural associations that each community has formed, the project team is gathering and analysing a wealth of publications and materials: journals, literature, life stories, photographs, collections of memorabilia and other forms of representation.

All researchers in the project are revealing the complex forms of interaction that have defined global Italian culture over the last 150 years and are developing the methods of study that we need in order to make sense of the way in which people inhabit a transcultural world by looking at the specific nature of a changing sense of belonging to modern Italian culture(s). This research is at the heart of the publications that the project is producing. Researchers have been presenting their work at an extremely wide series of seminars, workshops and other events in the UK, in Italy and throughout the world (see Engagement activities). The level of interest in our approach to the question of the ways in which cultures are translated and how they impact on the daily lives of individuals has been remarkable. The research is revealing the complexity and huge variation of cultural and linguistic practices of different communities.

Using as its primary object of enquiry the 150-year history of Italy as a nation state and its patterns of emigration and immigration, the project is developing a new framework for the discipline of Modern Languages in Higher Education as a whole, one which puts the interaction of languages and cultures at its core. The project is attempting to link the work that it is doing on global Italian cultures with the teaching of issues concerning cultural identity as they are taught in Schools through a pioneering series of collaborations with community schools in Edinburgh. The project is also linking its forms of inquiry with people's wider sense of cultural diversity through a series of workshops in the West Midlands (see Impact narrative).

The individual research projects of the team members on separate but connected articulations of Italian culture are revealing the dense network of ideas of belonging and difference. They have met with a huge amount of interest by members of the communities concerned and by the wider academic and non-specialist community. The work that the project in schools and within the wider community have revealed: the viability of 'translation' as a concept for exploring processes of cultural change and exchange; the value of 'translation' as a medium of self-reflection in artistic practice; the importance of art as a medium for the production of electively hybrid identities and practice; art and creative writing as a medium for exploring the interface local/global contact; the exhibition as a space of expression and cultural critique.

Within the discipline of Modern Languages, the model that TML has developed for the study of the transnational and transcultural that is based on the study of language and multi-lingualism, the concept of spatiality, the notion of temporality, and the performance of subjectivity has been adopted by leading specialists across Modern Languages disciplines and will form the basis of a new series of texts that will provide a new framework for the study of Modern Languages in Higher Education. They represent a set of new tools and approaches to the study of cultural and linguistic practices.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>TML has organized two major conferences in 2016 as well as two major exhibitions in Rome and London which have disseminated the findings of the project and encouraged very extensive participation in its aims and themes. Both conferences attracted capacity crowds while the exhibitions have been extremely successful in showing how academic research can be disseminated through the use of multimedia installations. In 2017 there will be further exhibitions in other parts of the world.
