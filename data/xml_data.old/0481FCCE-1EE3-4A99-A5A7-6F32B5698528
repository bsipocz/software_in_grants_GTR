Oriel Science is a public-facing exhibition and outreach space showcasing the University's STEM research. Our vision is to host rolling, thematic, science-based exhibitions aimed at our two target audiences: school students and the wider public. Alongside the gallery, Oriel Science will house a workshop offering a schools programme in parallel with each exhibition. We create accessible, informative and interactive exhibitions focused on the work and collaborations of the University's STEM community. We take visitors on a visceral journey through a scientific theme, ignite their curiosity to explore that theme, and leave a lasting legacy in their imagination. We will encourage younger visitors to choose STEM subjects at school leading to STEM degrees in University and we further develop the scientific literacy of older visitors.

Oriel Science launched on 10th September 2016 at the end of the British Science Festival which was hosted by Swansea University. Our venue was in a rent-free, empty commercial unit in the pedestrianised shopping mall in the Swansea city centre.

We were open to the public every weekend and during school holidays until June 2017. Our school holiday programme had organised special events and workshops focussing on the STEM research designed for school-aged students. In all we welcomed 16,000 public visitors and have had significant media coverage. Our feedback is overwhelmingly positive, over 90% say that they have learnt more about science as a result of their visit and a similar percentage would recommend us to a friend.

Alongside our public openings, we ran organised school visits where 900 students from 16 schools attended workshops targeted to their age-groups.

Due to our city centre location, Oriel Science attracted a new audience to STFC science: 40% of our visitors have not set foot on a Swansea University campus. Crucially, a postcode analysis of our public visitors showed that our visitor demographic matched that of Swansea as a whole in terms of the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation. This proved that we built a science exhibition centre which was welcoming to all, including the &amp;quot;hard-to-reach&amp;quot; sections of the community.

Our exhibitions will have linked, bilingual explanation board in Welsh and English, directly connecting us to audiences in Wales in the visitors' mother tongue.

Our first, pop-up exhibition is based on the theme of &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; and features 16 exhibits including the STFC LHC Roadshow, a range of particle physics detectors (a cloud chamber, Geiger counter, MX-10 detector and muon observatory). We have an audio visual animation of time dilation near black holes, an immersive experience showing a time lapse video of the southern stars with a sound track taken from the Voyager spacecraft. A 30 metre &amp;quot;time wall&amp;quot; has an animation of the history of the Universe from the Big Bang. The public is welcomed to the venue by a &amp;quot;Back to the Future&amp;quot; DeLorean and a Tardis &amp;quot;time machine&amp;quot; enticingly situated to be visible from the outside.

We are now planning our second themed exhibition, &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot;, to be launched when we open our permanent gallery space. This application seeks funding for a significant STFC footprint in this venture. In particular we are applying for funding for astronomically-themed exhibit utilising images from the Faulkes Telescope, mock-ups of earth observation satellites from ESA, costs for student ambassadors, and salary for our Curator. Our &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; exhibition represents a fantastic opportunity to engage visitors with STFC Science so that their understanding and appreciation of this science and technology is developed</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We will disseminate information about our exhibition using the Swansea University Press Office, using our excellent relationships with the local press.

We have already begun detailed discussions with Swansea Council regarding a long-term multi-million pound home for Oriel Science in their redevelopment space along the waterfront which will form part of the &amp;pound;1.3b &amp;quot;City Deal&amp;quot; recently announced by the Prime Minister. The City and County of Swansea is fully supportive of our Oriel Science project. This relationship will allow us to use the Council's extensive communication network to further advertise our work to the public.

Through our &amp;quot;Welsh Teachers to CERN&amp;quot; programme, we have excellent contacts with the Education Department in Wales which links us to Science teachers across the country. In addition, Swansea Physics has long-standing and highly popular MasterClasses and Christmas Lecture programmes. These are over-subscribed and the schools who have been involved will form the natural early-adopters of Oriel Science.

Swansea University's S4 schools outreach project also has extensive relationships with schools in Communities First areas who are keen to expand the range of activities that could be provided to their students.

Our colleagues in the Computer Science Department run Technocamps, which is an IT-based outreach programme funded to reach every high school in Wales, and we will build on their knowledge to develop our own network of schools.

We will share best practice with members of the Association of Science and Discovery Centres, ASDC, utilise our links with STEMNET Wales to advertise Oriel Science, and continue to use resources from the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement.

We already have links with the IOP's Lab-in-a-Lorry and have entered into a two-way discussion about designing a possible particle physics experiment for them.

Wales's National Science Academy is also a supporter of Oriel Science and will be keen to ensure we gaingood coverage across the country.

Our educational resources are, and will be bilingual and allow us to be directly fed into all schools across Wales.

In addition, we will obviously use the STFC Press Office and our colleagues and contacts in other UK Physics Departments to enlarge the footprint where Oriel Science is known and to share best practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14540</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R005966/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
