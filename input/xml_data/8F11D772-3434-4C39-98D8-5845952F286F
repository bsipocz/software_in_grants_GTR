However, academic analyses of uncertainty and decision-making vary considerably between disciplines. They differ in their relevance to real world decisions. 

The goal of this network proposal is to generate a funding proposition to allow Research Councils UK to form a permanent cross disciplinary Decision-Making Under Uncertainty Research and Evidence Hub (the 'Hub') made up from a wide range of academic experts and practitioners able to work in close proximity. The Hub's function wold be to co-ordinate best available expertise (or to commission it) and to offer government, industry and civil society partners tools to facilitate resilient and effective decision-making across a full range of real world uncertainty and practice contexts. Publishing relevant materials and manuals via a website, the Hub would meet the need for immediate, intermediate and long term consultation, research and training responses to practitioner requests. 

The network proposed will lay the foundation for the Hub by delivering a draft guide to &amp;quot;Uncertainty Triage&amp;quot;, and a &amp;quot;Code of Practice&amp;quot; for making resilient decisions under uncertainty. &amp;quot;Uncertainty Triage&amp;quot; will be designed to identify what aspects of a given real-world challenge are (a) likely to fall into traditional statistical/decision theoretic methods, (b) require a broader approach as mature probabilities are not available, and (c) those in which radical uncertainty dominates so that a case-by-case reflection is required. The Code of Practice will incorporate known hazards facing real-world decision making and will evolve to incorporate lessons derived from experience along the lines of airline pilot safety manuals.

We will implement the network through interaction between the PI (a social scientist and psychologist) and the CI (a mathematician and statistician) building on the expertise of a widening core group drawn from key practitioner collaborators and academics from very different disciplines, linked to a series of national and international centres of excellence. 

There are nine steps over 24 months: 
i. Engaging and integrating into the project a core group of practitioners from government and industry by undertaking with some of the academics a series of limited case studies describing in detail core features of some real world decision-making. 
ii. A kick off conference addressed by experienced policy-makers and thinkers to introduce practitioners and academics to each other and the issues. 
iii. Focusing the Core Group to explain their own frameworks for grappling with the cases collected above to people from outside their field. 
iv. Organizing one-on-one or small group follow up meetings with practitioners to develop and deepen analysis of the specific challenges. 
v. Broadening the core network group to those interested and willing. A website (and blog) will be created.
vi. Organizing an open conference to report progress and launch a call to apply to undertake feasibility projects. Up to &amp;pound;15,000 for 6-8 short projects of 6 months approx.
vii. Continue Core Network meetings (including a two-day retreat to deepen understanding) to draft and test the Uncertainty Triage and Code of Practice.
viii. Hold an open and highly interactive workshop conference (22 months) to discuss the feasibility projects and other emerging material (draft Triage and Code of Practice) to evaluate it from the practitioners' viewpoints. 
ix. Produce Conclusions edited into long and short reports published on the website (and in book form) including a funding proposal to form the network into 'the Hub'. 

The financial crisis, the Brexit decision and climate change create uncertainty. This network aims to help us deal with it.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of our network proposal is to put knowledge co-creation at the heart of our implementation. It means that we put impact now and in future at the heart of the proposal. 

From Day 1 we will create interactions and deep conversations between academics and practitioners designed to create impact - to help practitioners see the value of different academic viewpoints and to help academics to develop new tools and approaches that more accurately describe, analyse or are useful in practice. 

In fact, planning the proposal has already created initial conversations that have opened eyes among academic and practitioners starting with ourselves. They have made a difference which will be hugely amplified and leveraged in the formation of the network: there will be increased clarification and understanding between the PI and CI (as representatives of their several disciplines) and between practitioners (decision-makers in industry and government agencies) and academics drawn from a very wide range of disciplines across mathematical, physical, social and psychological science. In discussions to create the proposal we have already selected 27 academics (Case, p6) and 12 practitioners (Case, p5) as well as establishing relationships with 16 first class academic centres (below) and reaching another 40 or so experts elsewhere. The centres are hubs in their own often international networks and will be at the core of knowledge creation and onward dissemination. We have also spontaneously been contacted by others who know about the call. We will use these foundations both to construct a network and eventually to support the Hub.

A network website (which UCL have undertaken to maintain for at least 5 years even if the Hub proposal is eventually not funded) and mailing list will be at the centre of our network. Early on we will publish position papers and information and our prototype versions of the Uncertainty Triage and Decision-Making Code of Practice. The site will grow and be open for comment with an online form to allow requests for support. The further eventual aim is to produce both a book and academic articles and a report aimed at practitioners. We intend seeking sponsorship for the latter so that it can be produced along the lines of the LSE Munich Re programme report.
The hub (The RCUK Decision-Making Under Uncertainty Research &amp;amp; Evidence Hub) is what we expect the network to deliver clear feasibility-supported proposals about. It would aim to be a resource fir UK government, industry and civil society and an ongoing source of impact for UK research. Co-ordinating expertise and responding to requests from government and industry needing advice it aims to create a reputation that t can facilitate resilient and effective decision-making across a full range of real world uncertainty and practice contexts. If funded the hub would take over our network website and collate and publish relevant materials and manuals to meet the need for immediate, intermediate and long term consultation, research and training responses. The hub would be linked to the Centres we engage (below) and others and seek to work at three time horizons:

An immediate response (days/weeks) function would be expected to use (and further develop) the triage procedures and code of practice which we intend to be &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; tools that are adjusted with experience and feedback. 
An intermediate response (weeks/months) would use more experts such as those within the 'core' and from the teams and centres of expertise in the wider network (see below). We envisage they would conduct inter-/multi- disciplinary academic workshops to explore the features of the problem with researchers invited to attend and observe or deliver short presentations on the insights that their research or discipline can offer. 
The considered response (months/1-2 years) would be relevant to the commissioning of further research from teams or centres of expertise in the wider network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>329042</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>52F45425-33D7-42B5-9C61-32DE6DCC22DB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of conviction and narrative in decision-making under radical uncertainty.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theory &amp; psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/207f3b791548b9ade71411404532ee18"><gtr:id>207f3b791548b9ade71411404532ee18</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tuckett D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0959-3543</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9e9a3b4612c6.76857916</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P016847/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
