Chronic pain (i.e. pain that goes on for a long period of time and often has no known cause) can have a substantial effect on the lives of individuals and their families, especially on social networks and daily activity. In some cases, this can lead to depression, anxiety and isolation. Getting the right advice and support is often hard, sometimes due to other people s attitudes and lack of available and accessible help, which can be made worse by physical ageing. The number of people likely to experience chronic pain is set to increase in the coming decades. This provides policy makers, practitioners and the general public with considerable challenges in helping those people - who want to - live independently in their own homes. 

Our earlier work has shown that there is little research which explores older people s experiences of living with and managing chronic pain. We have also established that little is known about living and ageing with chronic pain in the community; in particular, the risk factors that may contribute to chronic pain (such as present or past occupation) and the outcomes and costs for people and their families.

Working with older adults and carers, this study will address the factors that impact on the experience and management of ageing with chronic pain. Ultimately, it will contribute to practical self-help strategies and educational material which may help to lessen the impact of pain. 

We will work with members of the health care team in partnership with older adults and their carers (this will include our established group of service users) to achieve the following outcomes:
1. Identify the attitudes and approaches adopted by general practitioners, primary care teams, pain clinics and older adults towards pain management in later life; 
2. Measure the economic consequences of pain in older age; 
3. Work with older adults to enhance existing resources and to develop working prototypes of new, innovative materials (e.g. written &amp;amp; audiovisual, including web-based resources) which will provide practical advice &amp;amp; help to older adults living with pain in the community; and
4. Explore with older adults acceptable &amp;amp; feasible ways to disseminate and deliver these self-help materials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Some suggest that with increasing age comes an increase in the incidence of chronic pain (Ferrell et al), with a potential to impact upon 50% of community dwelling older adults over the age of 65 (Helme &amp;amp; Gibson 2001). While adults with chronic pain may view their health as poorer (Reyes-Gibby et al 2002) there has been limited research that has focussed upon the specific impact of chronic pain amongst older adults as perceived by them and a limited attempt to identify their preferred pain management strategies (Schofield et al 2005)

The strategic vision of this study is to obtain a deep understanding of chronic pain and its economic impact as experienced by older adults. At the same time we will determine the perspectives of health care professionals through a series of interviews and surveys and by conducting a comprehensive review of the literature. This period of data collection will lead to the development of self-help materials along with the most acceptable and feasible ways of delivering these self-help materials. Therefore we will make recommendations for modes of delivering educational material, information &amp;amp; support to older adults living with chronic pain in the community. The study will comprise five phases, each informing the other and delivered between three institutions. Fundamental to the study will be the views and perspectives of the older adults who will inform each phase in a meaningful way.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1663864</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Cochrane Collaboration</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Review Group (PaPaS)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Suportive Care Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C4B8BE6-0A7D-4E7C-98E0-58B9FC26E074</gtr:id><gtr:impact>After prolonged discussion, this proposed review did not proceed as a Cochrane Review, but was completed, and published as listed elsewhere in the portfolio:

1. Persistent pain is a major problem in older age, causing distress and disability.
2. Many people have found tat there are things they can do to help themselves to cope with their pain, and to move on with their life.
3. Learning more about pain, how it affects you, and finding out tings you can do to help yourself are important parts of being able to manage your pain.
This booklet provides an introduction to the internet, sources of information , a brief introduction to self-management and a directory of useful organisations.

We wanted to gain insight into issues linked to family from the viewpoint of older people with chronic pain. This was done using a series of semi-structured interviews followed by a set of focus groups. In the latter we asked specific questions about being a grandparent. We found people placed great importance on their families .Grandparents was a highly valued social role. Pain -related barriers to grand parenting included: when grandchildren lacked understanding of how pain was affecting the grandparent and when grandparents had difficulty communicating their experience to grandchildren. Within our remit to produce materials to facilitate self-management, we produced a graphic novel/ comic book to help older people explain their experiences of chronic pain to younger people .</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7876DBD-C11C-4B42-8750-1849CFC5B742</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The medikidz comic book has been endorsed by the British Pain Society and Pain Association Scotland.it is currently available to buy from the Medikidz website.

The surveys were piloted in October 2010.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BC20FBA7-D972-43A0-921C-789DC2C5381E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet. The surveys will be distributed to health practitioners working in pain clinics throughout the UK and to General Practitioners within Aberdeenshire and Teesside in November and December 2010. The results of the surveys are expected to give insight into current attitudes and approaches to pain management amongst health practitioners and to obtain volunteers for a follow-up telephone interview.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>nhN2X5cWd5v</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Survey questionnaires</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Validated questionnaire instrument for assessing health professionals' attitudes and beliefs with respect to the diagnosis and management of chronic pain</gtr:description><gtr:id>300B1E5D-6E32-4682-A5FD-C0E27E6C39D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development and validation of PROFABS-OA formed the main part of the research resulting in successful completion of a PhD (Paul Cameron), funded by this grant</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589863751aa137.33917057</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Professional Attitudes and Beliefs Survey - Older Adult Version (PROFABS-OA)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The systematic search was designed to identify all relevant non-experimental and qualitative studies in peer-reviewed journals between 1990-2012, limited to the English language. A 3-step search strategy was used. An initial limited search of electronic databases including PUBMED, CINHAL, PSYCHINFO, and MEDLINE was undertaken in order to identify the keywords contained in the titles, abstracts and index terms used to describe relevant journal articles independently screened identified titles and abstracts for relevance. Article meeting the inclusion criteria were quality appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative studies. Findings : Iterative analysis is on going however two overarching themes are emerging.
1. Self-management as a task. 
2. Self-management as emotional labour and a social process</gtr:description><gtr:id>C819D9AC-45E8-4D62-A9E8-467567D28F04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This review is currently on going.
