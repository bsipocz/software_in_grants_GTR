In a British context, the accumulation of artefacts and objects over centuries of colonial rule left a difficult cultural legacy that museums continue to grapple with today. Complex situations demanding sensitive kinds of curatorial response can arise from the disclosure of historical details about how an object was originally acquired, or in relation to contemporary conditions of access and display. This may even extend to negotiations for temporary or permanent restitution. To date, situations such as these have most commonly arisen over museums' human history collections. They now need to be addressed for what we term 'difficult' natural history collections. \n\nIn practical terms, the research project will be based on a critical investigation into one collection characterised by its 'difficulty'. It will examine the historical-cultural geographies of, and possible future utilities for, the large collection of bird eggs held by Glasgow Museums. The eggs are estimated to number over 30,000. Few are put on public display and the collection remains under-researched, in part because of the profound shifts in British attitudes toward egg collecting. \n\nThe research will be object-centred and archive-led. Glasgow Museums' birds egg collection and archives will be key to research for, although the documentation associated with many specimens is quite limited, the museum is fortunate to hold in its archives the field logs and correspondence from a number of the eggs' original collectors, along with detailed records documenting their donations. Inquiries will extend to other national and organisational reference libraries, and potentially involve oral history work with long-serving and retired curatorial staff who have had different experience of dealing with difficult natural history collections. \n\nFramed by interdisciplinary literatures concerned with environmental values, material cultures and social practices, the project's aims and objectives are, variously: (i) to make an original contribution to scholarship about a once-common culture of natural history collecting that is now judged an illegal practice; (ii) to accumulate new knowledge about the provenance of an under-valued natural history collection, and the biographies of its collectors; (iii) to explore creative curatorial possibilities for the contextualised re-display of 'difficult' egg specimens for different users, through on-line access, schools and adult educational programmes, and/or a temporary exhibition; (iv) to deploy Glasgow Museums' diverse opportunities for public learning and access to raise critical questions about past 'cultures of nature' (especially their social, moral and legal contexts) as a means to explore wider human relationships with, and valuing of, a bio-diverse environment. The project will therefore investigate what more can yet be done with 'difficult' collections that might be too easily kept out of sight, or 'mothballed' backstage. \n\nThe project will have a potentially significant impact as it addresses challenging questions of provenance and display for natural history collections relevant to museum researchers, curators and managers. As a case study in dealing with difficulty (extending from matters of research design to the design of displays), the egg collection will offer lessons applicable to other museums in the UK and beyond. \n\nIn local terms, the project will promote greater research synergies between Glasgow Museums' human history and natural history collections as well as acting as a catalyst for future research collaboration between Glasgow Museums and the University of Glasgow. The project will also support, and possibly enhance, efforts by the DEFRA-sponsored Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime (PAW) to educate museum users about egg collecting and trading a</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The student researcher on the project will benefit from a twin-track career development programme, combining academic research training and a museum sector training in curatorial policy and collections-led research. Professional development opportunities in university and museum settings will significantly advance the student's prospects. Both host institutions will benefit from the presence of a researcher who moves regularly between different, but complementary, research communities. \n\nThrough the composition of the proposed CDA partnership, Glasgow Museums will benefit significantly as a result of research stemming from the studentship project. Deeper institutional knowledge about the origins and history of an extensive natural history collection will be produced by new biographically and culturally orientated research inquiries. As a consequence, Glasgow Museums will gain access to new data gathered in the form of 'donor stories', which pivot around collectors, specimens, clutches and collections. The standard pathway for dissemination of these findings will be academic publication and presentation. These research narratives will help contextualise the collection and provide a scholarly legacy of use to future scientific specialists and expert researchers making regular use of Glasgow Museums as a research institution. \n\nAt the other end of the visitor spectrum, versions of these same bird egg collection narratives can be deployed in schools activities concerned with biodiversity, conservation, or awareness of wildlife crime in Scotland, which take place at Kelvingrove Museum's 'Environmental Discovery Centre'. Clear pathways have been identified for project findings to feed into the activities of Glasgow Museums' Learning and Access section (including the preparation of education-based activities and schools packs), and its on-line presence via the 'Collections Navigator' search tool. Given the sensitivity of the subject under consideration and the difficult status of the egg collections, care will be taken to ensure that versions of project information are designed to be both appropriate and inclusive. \n\nMore ambitiously, if project designs for a temporary museum display on the history of birds egg collections and egg-collecting practices gain curatorial and managerial approval, and secure the necessary budgets, public audiences in significant number will benefit through the knowledge and understanding created by the display of previously unseen natural history specimens. With creative applications and impacts possible along the museum visitor spectrum, the findings of the studentship project will make a positive contribution to the nation's knowledge about, and awareness of, shifts in attitudes toward the natural environment, and the wide social benefits gained from pro-environmental behaviour. \n \nAdditionally, a series of government agencies, non-governmental organisations, and third sector interests will benefit from the project as it will enhance existing strategies for public communication and education initiatives about wildlife crime, including the theft of birds eggs in Scotland, and the international trade in rare eggs. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the DEFRA Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime (PAW) - a UK-wide partnership involving the Scottish Executive, the police force, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, SNH, and RSPB - share a commitment to public education about legal protection for bird populations, legal measures for the prosecution of wildlife criminals, and the promotion of wider social values embodied in pro-environmental behaviour. \n(See: http://www.defra.gov.uk/paw/)\nDuring application preparation, officers representing SNH and the RSPB have confirmed their support for the proposed CDA partnership project.
