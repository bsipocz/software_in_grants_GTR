For the development of efficient strategies to improve skin repair it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying normal and impaired healing. For my project, I am seeking to further describe functions of small ribonucleic acids (RNA) molecules, miR-29s, which I identified as regulators of the top layer of the skin called the epidermis. Upon wounding, the cells of the epidermis (mostly keratinocytes) are responsible for covering the wound site with a new layer of skin that protects our body from infection entry and water loss. Keratinocytes can sufficiently grow and migrate into the wound site only in a healthy skin. It is very important to understand how this process is regulated in the normal skin, and then how this regeneration of keratinocytes is deregulated in patients with impaired wound healing. The overall goal of this research is to enhance normal growth of keratinocytes and thereby, regeneration of the epidermis. However, on the other hand, the excessive growth of keratinocytes results in a hyper-thickened skin, cracking of the epidermis, water loss, and severe secondary infections. Thus, it is important to find molecules that regulate and ensure a fine-tuned control over the normal growth of keratinocytes. Small RNAs, like miR-29s, have been already described to function as precise and physiologic regulators of normal skin growth. Importantly, because of the small size and chemical properties of short nucleic acids, miRs can be used for molecular therapy. miR-29s have already been tried in the clinic to improve skin condition in patients with cutaneous sclerosis (manifested by the abnormal skin thickening), and thus can potentially be rapidly used for molecular therapy of other skin diseases, including wounds. However, it requires knowing all possible molecules that interact with miR-29s inside keratinocytes, and all intra- and intercellular processes, which may be regulated by miR-29s in the epidermis. I will use human keratinocytes isolated from human skin biopsies remaining after non-therapeutic surgeries (e.g., plastic surgery or circumcisions) and grow keratinocytes into human skin equivalents on artificial collagen matrix. This will allow genetic manipulation of miR-29 levels, biochemical pull-down, purification, and analysis of the functional miR-29 complexes with other molecules. I will study the effect of miR-29 on growth and migration of keratinocytes and will use short synthetic nucleic acid molecules to inhibit miR-29. This will allow development of the new strategy to achieve a successful regeneration of the skin during wound healing, after massive burns, and in reconstructive surgeries. I will also study the function of miR-29s in murine wound healing model, necessary to mimic the complexity of the in vivo regeneration. The long-term goal of the project is to utilize miR-29 to improve skin regeneration in patients suffering from large acute wounds, bedsores, and diabetic ulcers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A large percentage of the population suffers from impaired wound healing, and the incidence of chronic, non-healing skin ulcers is continuously increasing in an aging society. The development of efficient strategies for the improvement of wound repair requires understanding of the mechanisms underlying normal and impaired healing. Many factors can interfere with one or more phases of cutaneous healing process, thus causing improper or impaired wound healing in patients. Recent data implicates microRNAs (miRs) as one such factor involved in wound repair. Because of the short sequence (~20 nt) and the tissue-specific activity, miRs may be targets for oligonucleotide (ON)-based RNA silencing therapy. This approach is particularly promising in the skin due to the accessibility of this tissue that allows local miR manipulation. miR-29 regulates collagen production by fibroblasts and is a new therapeutic target in the Phase I clinical trial for cutaneous sclerosis. However, the regulation and functions of miR-29 in homeostatic and regenerating skin remain largely unknown. My previous work identified an important function of miR-29s in regulating desmosomes in normal and hyperproliferative epidermis. This proposal will build on these findings to determine keratinocyte-specific functions of miR-29s in normal epidermis and during re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds. I will use miR crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (miR-CLIP) to identify mRNA targets of miR-29s in human keratinocytes. I will also use modified antisense miR-29 ON for efficient delivery, tracking, and downregulation of miR-29 function in murine wounds in vivo and in the wound model of the 3D cultures of human keratinocytes ex vivo. These experiments will identify new RNA targets of miR-29s that regulate growth and differentiation of human keratinocytes and will develop a novel oligonucleotide-based miR/RNA silencing approach to improve cutaneous wound healing.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project will have significant impact on different beneficiaries due to the potential identification of miR-29-mediated effect on skin repair and the novel methodology of identifying miR-29 targets in human cells. In addition to other academic non-profit research groups, commercial suppliers of the analytical tools for miR analysis, and pharmaceutical companies working on miR diagnostic and therapy will greatly benefit from the results of the proposed project. Thus, for development of miR-29 mimics and inhibitors for research, and later, for the clinical use, it will be very important to have a confirmed set of target RNAs that can be used to confirm the activity of miR-29 in vivo. For example, the miR-29-based therapy against scleroderma of the skin, which recently entered Phase 1 clinical trials in the U.S. (compound MRG-201, miRagen Therapeutics, Inc.), could be potentially used to treat other skin diseases, including impaired wound healing. However, it requires identification of miR-29 target RNAs, specific for each cell type of the skin (keratinocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells) to prevent possible side-effects and design the best therapeutic strategy based on miR-29 mimics and anti-sense sequences. I will start with the identification of miR-29 targets in keratinocytes, because this cell type is required for the restoration of the skin during wound healing. These results will be available after completion of the Objective 1 of the proposed project, and can be later used as a platform to discover miR-29 targets in other cell types of the skin.
 To take miR-29-mediated therapy into chronic wound healing would require knowing precise temporal and spatial changes in miR-29 expression in wounds during the time course of cutaneous repair. These results will be available from the data generated in Objective 2 and 3 of the proposed project. The results of the Objective 2 will show levels of expression and localization of miR-29 during the time-course of wound healing, and test the effect of local miR-29 inhibition at the time point with the highest level of miR-29 expression. This experiment will reveal miR-29 functions at different stages of wound healing. Next, I will test the systemic effect of local miR-29 anti-sense oligonucleotides application in the murine model of wound healing, and then validate the most important findings in human ex vivo model based on skin equivalents transfected with anti-sense miR-29 oligonucleotides. This will allow also finding of the best modifications for the oligonucleotides for delivery and stability in vivo, and contribute to the development of the commercial large-scale production of miR-based therapeutics.
 Most importantly, my project will benefit the public sector and the wider public, first in the U.K., where a large percentage of the population suffers from impaired wound healing. The incidence of chronic, non-healing skin ulcers is continuously increasing in an aging society and in patients with diabetes. Other skin conditions, such as hyper-proliferation of keratinocytes in keratoderma and psoriasis, lead to huge impairment of quality of life of the patients. In addition, the treatment and disabilities cause by skin diseases comprises a substantial economical burden on the society in the U.K. and world-wide. The miR-based therapy can significantly enhance quality of life, health and creative output of patients suffering from debilitating skin conditions, such as massive burns, wounds, and keratodermatitis. 
 The fact that many miR-based therapeutic compounds have already entered phase I and II clinical trials brings the timescale of the my research impact into the nearest future. The direct application of synthetic modified miR-29-based oligonucleotides to treat wounds in patients may be possible within the next 7-10 years. The results of my project can expand the applicability of miR-29-based compounds, such as MRG-201, to other skin diseases within the next decade</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-07-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1187323</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P009700/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7EE9741E-CF94-420A-B0AB-A7811523CF2C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Skin</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
