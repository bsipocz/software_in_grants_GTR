A common example of a biofilm that everyone can relate to is the formation of plaque on teeth, which left untreated causes tooth decay. While biofilm formation in the mouth is mostly harmless, it has been estimated that up to 80 % of all infections worldwide are biofilm-related. In particular, biofilm colonisation of implanted devices such as Endotracheal tubes presents a particularly resilient reservoir of infection, shielded from systemic antibiotics, that often leads to the emergence of multidrug-resistant colonies. Patients contracting such infections have a particularly bleak outlook, with mortality rates for diseases such as Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) exceeding 50 % in certain patient groups. Quite simply, establishing a management strategy for these organisms is a global priority.

Cold plasma technology has recently attracted global attention as it provides an effective means to destroy biofilm contamination, including biofilms containing multidrug resistant bacteria. A major barrier to the implementation of this promising technology is a lack of innovation in plasma source development. This award will tackle the challenge by developing novel power sources and systems that produce an output tailored specifically to manage biofilm contamination on implanted devices in situ; these efforts will be driven by a closely interacting team of specialists in microbiology and translational medicine, clinicians and patients. Key to this will be the unique methods and understanding uncovered on my previous EPSRC funded research which addressed the Physical Sciences grand challenge area of Emergence and Physics Far From Equilibrium (EP/J005894/1).

My long term research vision is to establish a multidisciplinary centre of excellence focused on the development of novel plasma based physical interventions as part of my ambition to revolutionise technology driven approaches to global health challenges. The Centre will act as a hub to facilitate new thinking/methodologies/technology in this area driven by novel engineering and physical sciences research and will be a catalyst to explore new scientific horizons. Delivering this vision will demand a transformative approach that pushes the frontiers of plasma science and breaks-down traditional discipline boundaries. Success will require creativity, ambitious plans, high levels of flexibility and the necessary taking of risks balanced against the scope for reward. I will manage these aspects within the framework of a coherent research programme, and activities will be underpinned by a hand-picked team of research leaders. At the heart of my approach is the sustained and active involvement of end-users to inform research design and research goals. My approach will ensure priorities focus on clinical need, an essential factor to drive innovation and ensure successful translation. 

The average timeline for translation of new technologies in to the healthcare sector ('bench to bed') is 17 years; given the immediate clinical need for the proposed technology, accelerating the translational process will be a key priority of the Centre. Drawing on the wealth of expertise available in the project team and the unique innovation eco-system in Liverpool, which includes the North West Coast Academic Health Science Network (AHSN - www.nwcahsn.nhs.uk), a translational plan has been established to see the introduction of plasma decontamination technology in the healthcare sector within a 10 - 12 year timeframe. The introduction of this technology will have a significant impact in a market sector valued at $14 billion; directly contributing to the UK's strong life sciences industry, which employs an estimated 183,000 and generates a combined estimated turnover of &amp;pound;56bn.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My vision for the Centre falls directly within the Frontiers of Physical Interventions Healthcare Grand Challenge. The technologies developed within the Centre will address an urgent clinical need that is a blight to patients and places an enormous economic burden on the NHS. Infected indwelling lines can have catastrophic consequences for many patients groups (i.e. those in critical care), with mortality rates for diseases such as Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) exceeding 50 %. The challenge is not specific to the UK and any technology to prevent infections on implanted devices would have enormous impact in a market sector valued at $14 billion.

In order to make a transformative advance in this Grand Challenge the activities of the Centre will push boundaries in many of the cross-cutting themes and RCUK priority areas. Disruptive technologies for sensing and analysis of complex biofilms will be developed; these will provide a real-time indication of infection. The devices developed within the Centre will provide a minimally invasive means of intervention and monitoring, addressing another of the cross-cutting activities. The fundamental plasma science to be harnessed within the Centre falls directly within the Physics Grand Challenge area of 'Matter Far from Equilibrium'. The synergy arising within the Centre will ensure the UK plays a leading role in this innovative, yet fiercely competitive, research area and will provide a means to significantly shorten the pathways to clinical adoption of plasma technology in the healthcare sector. Given that the average time for translation of new technologies in to the healthcare sector (bench to bed) is 17 years; accelerating this process will be a key impact of the Centre. Using the unique innovation eco-system available in Liverpool, which includes the North West Coast Academic Health Science Network (AHSN - www.nwcahsn.nhs.uk), resources and support have been committed to accelerate the translational process, yielding translation in a 10-12 year timeframe.

Key impacts that will be realised through this award:
(1) A hub will be created for research leaders to come together facilitating the generation of new thinking/methodologies/technology (Year 1).
(2) The Centre will have an ethos that nurtures innovation, through continuous stakeholder involvement and by supporting exploratory projects (Year 1- 5).
(3) The synergy arising within the Centre will help establish new translational pathways for plasma technology in to the healthcare sector (Year 1 - 5).
(4) The Centre will act as an interface between UK academia, Public Health England, End-users, ethical/regulatory bodies and healthcare device manufacturers (Year 1-5).
(5) A tailored package of training and mentoring will provide the PI with the skills necessary to accelerate his career and become a leader in the healthcare sector (Year 1-5).
(6) Technologies will be developed with translation in mind; with continuous stakeholder involvement, minimising barriers to introduction in to the healthcare sector (Year 1 -5). 
(6) The Centre will become a self-sustaining activity that produces lasting academic and societal impact (5+ Years).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder
