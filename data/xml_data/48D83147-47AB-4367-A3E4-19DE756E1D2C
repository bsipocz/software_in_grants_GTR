This research objective will focus on characterising the molecular and cellular mechanisms that maintain lymphocyte repertoires and on age-dependent changes in memory cell formation and function. To meet this objective we will study mechanisms of lymphocyte selection and survival and importantly expand our current portfolio to consider the role of non-lymphoid cells in memory cell formation. Here the recent recruitment of Alice Denton, who is a BBSRC Future Leader Fellow studying stromal cells, offers a unique contribution. The mechanisms by which stromal cells promote or inhibit germinal centre responses will be studied and we will address potential mechanisms of trans-differentiation into follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of older stromal cells. This work will be further strengthened by collaboration with Dr Simon Cook in the Signalling ISP who is engaged in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the SASP using model cell lines and gene editing technologies. We will study human and mouse immune responses. The study of mouse models will enable us to dissect cellular responses that are driven by intrinsic versus extrinsic factors - an essential requirement for a mechanistic understanding of the cellular interactions that sustain the repertoire and drive the GC response to produce humoral and cellular memory. Based on published evidence, we suggest that an excess of interferon &amp;atilde; (IFN&amp;atilde;) may contribute to defective immune responses at the extremes of age and that a better understanding of the molecular processes limiting IFN&amp;atilde; production may enable productive immune responses and avoidance of autoantibody production. The project will also look at interaction between lymphocytes and epithelial or stromal cells as it is fundamental for both immunity and the maintenance of tissue integrity during stress. Epithelial cells form the first cellular barrier between host and environment. In the lung they mediate mucociliary clearance and also important coordinators of immune responses as they produce a variety of cytokines, surfactants and antimicrobial peptides that are able to modulate pathogens and commensals directly, and also recruit leucocytes to tissues to facilitate local immune responses. Stromal cells respond to infection by remodelling the lung tissue to facilitate local immune responses, such as in the formation of germinal centres35. In this objective we seek a deeper understanding of the interactions between epithelial cells, stromal cells and lymphocytes using the lung as a relevant model of immune responses to viruses and bacteria in a complex non-lymphoid tissue. This is important because respiratory infections are poorly tolerated and a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of immunity and resilience to infection has the strong potential to bring benefits36. We describe here plans, which build on our investment in these models, to elucidate the role of the PI3K pathway in the molecular regulation of lung epithelial and stromal cell immune function. Our focus on PI3K builds on significant previous work performed by us and others, and our proposed studies will discover new contexts in which this pathway, which links growth factor and nutrient sensing mechanisms to cellular responses, functions. We want to understand more about the immune cell-stromal cell interactions that underpin effective immune responses outside of the specialised environment of lymphoid tissue as this is relevant to the mechanisms of vaccine efficacy. Moreover, this is particularly important to health-span because normal ageing is associated with increased susceptibility to infections of the lung such as Influenza A Virus (IAV) and streptococcal pneumonia (Strep). These pathogens often act in concert, such that infection with flu increases the susceptibility to and severity of a subsequent Strep infection37. The use of co-infection models will strengthen our understanding of physiologically relevant immune responses, as the immune responses elicited in the young by these co-challenges remain incompletely characterised making it very difficult to identify the nature of the defects that occur upon ageing. The reason why resistance to these pathogens drops precipitously upon ageing is poorly understood, but is likely to involve a reduced capacity to produce high affinity antibodies and the defective function of innate immune cell such as neutrophils. Importantly, neutrophils engage in a dialogue with lymphocytes in inflamed tissues and, through the elaboration of cytokines, can influence lymphocyte function and immune memory and support the development of tertiary lymphoid structures in the lung.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1162487</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/B/000C0427</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
