In November 2008 a Fair Employment Enforcement Board was set up to look at issues of workplace exploitation and abuse beyond non-compliance with the National Minimum Wage. However, the Board met for the final time in May 2010 and nothing has replaced it. It is our view that this reflects a failure to monitor, support and protect the UK's most vulnerable - largely temporary and migrant - workers rather than an absence of exploitation and abuse per se. We propose using ESRC follow-on funding to effectively re-gain the impetus that led to the Fair Employment Enforcement Board getting established and, specifically, to set up an independent and multi-stakeholder 'Forced Labour Monitoring Group'. This group would draw together government inspection agencies, policy makers, academics, and representatives from business, the unions and the wider voluntary and community sector. It would also be both virtual (via a website) and face-to-face (via a series of five workshops). We focus on 'forced labour' because it has a basis in UK law. It was made a stand-alone criminal offence under Section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) in 2009 and Section 47 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing Act (Scotland) in 2010. In other words, the Forced Labour Monitoring Group will be directed towards identifying and seeking to prevent specific forms of workplace abuse and exploitation that are now illegal under UK law. Examples of outlawed forced labour practices include: physical or sexual violence (threat of and/or actual harm); restriction on movement; bonded labour; withholding of wages; retention of passports and identity documents; and threat of denunciation to the authorities (ILO, 2005: 20-21). The Forced Labour Monitoring Group would also directly intervene in current policy debates around, amongst other things: the link between immigration policy and forced labour; the future of the different UK government inspection bodies; the future of Legal Aid; and, the future of the Employment Tribunal system. Furthermore, we see the FLMG as a 12-month pilot for a potentially permanent network that could be independent and/ or embedded within government (along the lines of either the Fair Employment Enforcement Board or an All-Party Parliamentary Group).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research is expressly designed with the welfare of abused and exploited workers in mind. Specifically, we note the current inactivity (since May 2010) of the 'Fair Employment Enforcement Board' and the proposed changes to workplace regulation (Davey Review), Legal Aid, and the Employment Tribunal systems. This highly dynamic policy context makes the establishment of an independent monitoring group - that places the welfare of vulnerable, often agency and/ or migrant workers, at the fore - even more pressing. Moreover, it is surprising given the recent work of the TUC (via its 2008 Commission on Vulnerable Employment), BIS and CAB (via the 2008 Vulnerable Worker Enforcement Forum), the Equality and Human Rights Commission (via the 2010 Inquiry in the Meat and Poultry Processing Sectors) and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (via the 2010 Forced Labour research programme) that such a group does not already exist. 

As well as being focused on the welfare of workers, the Forced Labour Monitoring Group (FLMG) would support the work of the third sector - most notably the CAB, Unions, Anti-Slavery International, and the Migrants Rights Network - as they seek to tackle and reduce workplace exploitation and abuse in the UK. Alongside this, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is now a priority of the major transnational corporations in the UK and the FLMG would dovetail with this CSR agenda. 

Overall, we expect that the 12-month project to create a platform upon which a more permanent multi-stakeholder umbrella network could be established. In other words, we see the FLMG as a pilot project that could be taken forward in one of two ways: either as a wholly independent monitoring group operating by stakeholder consensus; or, as a policy network embedded within the Parliamentary system. In terms of the latter, an All-Party Parliamentary Group on Forced Labour could be a longer-term outcome of the FLMG, or, the Departmentally-embedded 'Fair Employment Enforcement Board' model could be revived. 

Finally, debate and discussion around forced labour is still in its infancy. The academically-orientated journal papers on forced labour, based around the five workshop themes, allied with the policy-orientated 'Forced Labour in the UK' book (as part of the Policy Press 'Social Harm' series) would address this issue. The impact of the pilot FLMG would therefore be assured irrespective of whether or not stakeholders decided to take it forward beyond the 12-month funding period.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25261</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the award was to create an organisation, that is it brought together a number of organisations (now numbering 53) across the UK which were concerned about the issue of forced labour (a form of modern slavery). The Group was initially formed in 2013 and held a series of workshop seminars. During the early course of thee workshops, the government announced its intention to present a Modern Slavery Bill to Parliament (which happened first in December 2013).
The focus of the Group since then has largely been to draw together national and international evidence on the extent of forced labour and its occurrence throughout the UK and to use this to press for changes to the Modern Slavery Bill in line with the evidence gathered by the Group both through academic and personal contacts and by use of the website developed specifically for this purpose (www.forcedlabour.org). This evidence is summarised in a monograph, Forced Labour, What Next?, published by the FLMG in 2014. The monograph was circulated to a very substantial number of MPs and Peers active in the debates on the Bill and members of the FLMG have been very prominent in providing evidence to Parliamentary committees considering aspects of the Bill. Evidence (both written and verbal) has been presented to
1. the Review Committee established by the Home Secretary under the Chairmanship of Frank Field MP (Sept.-December 2013)
2. The joint Committee of Lords and MPs established to scrutinise the Bill (January-March 2014)
3. A briefing meeting of prominent Peers (September 2014)
4. The Opposition Lead, Diana Johnson MP, (July 2014)
5. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights (June 2014)
6. A briefing at the Speaker's House on the occasion of Anti Slavery Day
7. Regular inputs at the Advisory Board of the Human Trafficking Foundation
7. and a number of other individual and joint Briefings. A specific briefing paper was written for Commons members in the autumn of 2014 as the Bill was being debated.
Additionally, members of FLMG have met and communicated with key policy actors throughout the process including the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, Northern Ireland and Scotland Parliamentary interests, and many NGOs including Antislavery International, ECPAT, Human Trafficking Foundation.; and have been in considerable demand for presentations to a range of national, regional and local bodies including trafficking partnerships, police forces, academic interests and policy fora.
Throughout this process, FLMG liaised with senior policy and Parliamentary officers at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which had published (2012-2014) a series of key research reports on forced labour.

The FLMG has become a leading figure throughout this period in promoting debate around a series of issues including the scope of the AntiSlavery Commissioner's remit, the remit and role of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, the question of supply chains (on which the government made a concession to introduce a new clause in the Bill, better victim protection, and a stronger emphasis overall on forced labour. As a result the number of organisations in membership of FLMG has grown by about 20% during its life, and the website is used widely to exchange useful information, research findings and news.
Consequent on the very successful life of the FLMG, the Jospeh Rowntree Foundation has now awarded a further grant to enable the Group to run an 18 month series of workshops to examine the Bill in its final enacted form, identify gaps in legislation and any discrepancies as between English, Scottish and North Irish legislation, update on new research and set out a research agenda for the following years. This series is now being planned by Professor Gary Craig (Durham University) and Dr Alex Balch (University of Liverpool).

Other academic outputs are being prepared from the work of the Group and several articles are due to be published this year.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1037D69A-18F3-4DFD-BE82-5C082F5FE2C6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54cfabac885806.55557517</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J020567/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>E67C179A-DE6C-4B17-9365-32A005F191A7</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J020567/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>88639.51</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-09-03</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>D01F6FC4-507B-412B-BF4F-4720EB599B57</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J020567/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>25261.3</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-09-03</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
