It is particularly difficult to diagnose with the result that by the time most patients visit their doctor with symptoms the cancer has spread and it is difficult to treat successfully by surgery.
 
However there is a pre-existing benign condition called Barret's oesophagus which can be monitored by gastrointestinal endoscopy. A small percentage of patients with Barrett's oesophagus will develop oesophageal cancer. If these patients can be identified early then it is possible to treat them successfully.
 
This research will install a high performance microscope called a SNOM on the infrared free electron laser on the ALICE accelerator at Daresbury. This microscope will make it possible to obtain high resolution chemical images of tissue from patients with Barrett's oesophagus that will make it possible to diagnose whether the patients will go on to develop oesophageal cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Linked to ST/G008248/1.

Medicine: A positive outcome of this research will have a major impact on the diagnosis, prognosis and understanding of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This is the fastest rising incidence of cancer in the western world. The development of a diagnostic would be particularly important since this cancer is difficult to diagnose. Most patients have distant metastases on diagnosis and are not suitable for surgery and since surgery is the only potentially curative treatment survival rates are very poor. However progress from a pre-existing condition, Barrett's oesophagus, can be monitored by gastrointestinal endoscopy. The challenge is to identify patients with Barrett's oesophagus who will develop oesophageal cancer. 
 
If this approach is successful it also opens up a new approach to the study of the development of this and other cancers. Oesophageal cancer is not a homogenous entity but is composed of a number of different cell types and extracellular matrix proteins called the &amp;quot;stroma&amp;quot;. The stroma is very difficult to study and the combination of the tissue culture facility (TCF) and infrared (IR) red free-electron laser (FEL) /SNOM combination on ALICE provides a unique opportunity to investigate its nature and development. Individual components of the stroma can be grown in the TCF and studied separately using the SNOM. The various components can then be grown together and studied in combination. This would make it possible to study the important interactions between components of the disease. The insight gained from this research may make it possible to understand the biochemistry that drives the development of the disease and provide the information needed to develop alternative therapies. 
 
If, as anticipated, these experiments are successful there will be considerable demand from clinicians in other hospitals for access to the IR FEL/SNOM combination on ALICE for studies of a variety of other cancers. The Manchester hospitals are interested in applying this approach to Breast and prostate cancers.
 
Technology: This programme will establish the communication between accelerator physicists and the research team that is necessary to ensure that the operation of the accelerator and the configuration of the IR FEL and SNOM are optimised.
 
Industry/ Health Service: The demonstration of a diagnostic for this and other cancers would open up a new technology for health care based on accelerator driven IR FEL/ SNOM instruments. In addition to the health benefits to patients an improved diagnostic would significantly improve the efficiency of the health service. This would make the development of the technology cost effective and create a new market for accelerators and their components. This would be a world-wide market.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26355</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/K00154X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D16FDB98-8CBA-4298-8ACD-955DF734E7F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cells</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
