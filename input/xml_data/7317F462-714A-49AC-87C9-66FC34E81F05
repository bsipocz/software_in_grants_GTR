There will be a strong focus on the effects at a local level on both individuals and firms. As a result we intend to draw a clear picture showing how the Brexit vote has actually affected different parts of the country, and what might happen to individual firms and workers in different regions as a result of our future engagement with the European Union and rest of the world.

To date most analysis has focused on the broad effects of Brexit on the UK economy as a whole, but little attention has been given to the regional and local effects of various trade deal scenarios. As areas in the UK differ in terms of which type of industry dominate the local economy, it is likely that different trade deals will have differing effects on different regions. For example, finance is a leading sector in London while manufacturing is relatively small: conversely in the North East of England, the manufacturing sector dominates, while finance contributes little to the local economy. Given the regional disparity that exists in terms of employment and wages in the UK currently, it is vital to understand how trade agreements may alleviate or exacerbate the existing division.

In particular this research intends to assess the longer term impact of various trade agreements on the living standards of individuals in different regions. This will be assessed through examining the likely impact on wages, the wage distribution, and prices for goods and services in local areas. Related to this is an investigation of the likely impact on firms, such as their productivity levels and an assessment as to whether factors such as firm size are important in determining local effects. It will also assess the shorter term impacts resulting from changes occurring immediately after the Brexit vote. For example, directly after the Brexit vote there was a depreciation of the pound and stock market valuations of certain companies changed. We will examine the impact of these two effects on regional outcomes such as wages, employment, and the prices of local goods and services.

Ultimately, the main objective of the proposed research is to identify policies that would provide the greatest economic benefits to the UK in its engagement with the European Union and the rest of the world. We expect the findings of the project to provide robust evidence as to which trade policies can best take into account the needs of different regions and different sectors of the UK economy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As members of the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at LSE, we have participated in an active programme of dissemination of Brexit-related issues to policymakers, media, firms and the general public. The grant would enable us to create and develop the resources and networks to further this research and dissemination agenda. An economist journalist who has also had extensive policymaking experience in the Bank of England and the Treasury will help in dissemination and in the creation of Economist style reports highlighting policy alternatives and presenting evidence of their relative efficacy. These will be complemented by a user friendly data toolbox we will mount on a specially created website enabling practitioners to upload readily available data series to generate indicators for the regional impact of Brexit on real wages.

We would build on the LSE's existing networks and the established record of the CEP to ensure broad policy impact of the proposed project. We are already in touch with policymakers and stakeholders in the UK. As explained in the Pathways to Impact, we will solicit their views to ensure that the proposed research and analyses reflect policy priorities. This will be accomplished through regular meetings with those in government and business, and through on-site visits to different parts of the country. 

The findings of the research will be disseminated through mass media and social media, as happened in the run-up to the referendum. 

The proposed research would have broad impact, in policy-making and in public discussion. Three types of policymakers will directly benefit from the research: 
policymakers in the UK, who formulate and implement economic policies such as MPs, HMT, BoE, DIT and City Councils; 
policymakers in the EU, such as MEPs, DG-Competition, ECB and DG-Trade, who formulate and implement broad sets of policies related to EU's relations with Britain and the rest of the world; 
and policymakers in international institutions (e.g. WTO, OECD, IMF) and in countries outside the EU who have strong economic ties with Europe (e.g. Commerce Ministry of India, USTR). These policymakers together with public policy commentators will benefit from having access to research-based assessments of the potential impact of Brexit on local economies and regional wages under different scenarios for UK's relations with the EU and the rest of the world.

Firms, banks and business associations will benefit from the objective research summaries, the in-depth analyses of the actual short-term impacts and the projected long-term forecasts of Brexit on economic activity. 

The data toolbox would be useful for businesses, policymakers and public policy commentators, who wish to undertake further analysis.

Informed members of the general public will also benefit from independent and objective analyses of the impact of Brexit on their local economy and on real wages in their region. To ensure wide dissemination, the findings of the research will also be summarized as blog posts. Blog posts typically contain a comments section, and we expect this would be helpful in generating public discussion around the main economic issues.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>228710</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A3F60D53-536C-4E3E-836D-F859731D283E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Local Economic Effects of Brexit</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>National Institute Economic Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2c2d037208d6e04fb595ec148fd85d9c"><gtr:id>2c2d037208d6e04fb595ec148fd85d9c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dhingra S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d76747d7d55.74833116</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R001944/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>71E94BA5-333E-4F49-9ECA-60771CC7532E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
