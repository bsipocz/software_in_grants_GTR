The frequency of the verb, its meaning, and its sound pattern influence children's production of errors. However these factors are not well understood, and they change as children grow up.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this project, an investigation of the eariiest stages of past tense acquisition in English will be carried out using two tasks that encourage 2-5 year-olds to produce past tense forms. The data will be analysed with reference to a wide range of&lt;br />frequency, sound and meaning properties of verbs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Analysing all of these factors in a single study will provide a much more accurate picture of the acquisition process than is currently available, and allow evaluation of current theories of past tense acquisition.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A database documenting the children's performance on 300 different verbs and categorising the verbs on a large number of established and new properties will be made available to the research community. This database can then be used to&lt;br />form the basis for future research on English typically-developing and language-disordered populations, and to inform research on other languages.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, a computational model of past tense acquisition will be produced using the data from the study to improve understanding of how the various verb factors interact to influence production of the past tense. This model can then be used to evaluate possible intervention programmes before they are used by speech and language therapists.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>267801</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visit, Ashton</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F6E0E7C-C583-4323-AE73-E1E1746FA4AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interactive lecture inspired a lot of discussion and questions about how children learn language among both students and staff.

The PI (Theakston) in collaboration with Prof. Julian Pine (Academic, University of Liverpool), Dr. Anne Hesketh (Academic &amp;amp; clinician, University of Manchester) and Dr Emma Pagnamenta (Research Manager, Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists) organized and delivered a training workshop for SLTs (October 2015, http://www.lucid.ac.uk/news-and-events/events/slt-workshop-methods-for-informally-assessing-children-s-language/), part of which specifically targeted language elicitation techniques for working with children. Summaries of children's past tense performance on individual verbs and sub-groups of verbs, along with elicitation stimuli and scripts are available for SLTs to download and use in their practice from our project website. We are currently working directly with a number of SLTs interested in implementing these techniques into their practice.

Second, our findings are of interest to Early Years practitioners, especially in the context of enhanced Early Years provision for two-year-olds. A greater awareness of language development within the 2-3yr age group has been signalled as an area for targeted training. The PI, along with Prof. Elena Lieven (University of Manchester) was responsible for designing and delivering a training conference for Early Years Practitioners in the Stockport area in February 2016. One of the sessions included a focus on children's grammatical errors. Past tense errors are one of the common problems seen in children with Specific Language Impairment, thus increasing awareness among practitioners of patterns of development may, in the longer term, increase the likelihood of early diagnosis and effective interventions.

Third, members of the public often express interest in understanding the errors children make and their origins. The PI has delivered a series of talks as part of the University Widening Participation initiative, informing sixth form students, staff, and the wider public about children's past tense production.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A5554B0C-B02A-48DC-9CC7-6C0394998209</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5672e66875f831.94004977</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>New methods and knowledge:
We compared children's performance in producing past tense inflections on a stem-based elicitation task, with a strong emphasis on phonological representations, to a novel and more ecologically valid video inflection task with an inherently higher load on semantic information. We created a standard picture task and animations for 120 English verbs and elicited these from 900 children across the two tasks aged 2;6-5;5 years. Our results demonstrate that the rate at which children produce correct and error responses varies as a function of their age, the regularity of the verb, and the task, reflecting different routes to access or generate past tense forms as a function of context.

New research resources and knowledge
We produced a database that documents children's performance on a large number of early-acquired verbs. To this end, we tested 543 children aged between 2;6-5;5 on 300 verbs using the standard picture inflection task, and analysed their rate of correct responses and error for each verb across development. These data reveal interesting differences between verbs in the children's responses, and will provide a benchmark against which to compare the performance of children in other studies, and those with language disorders.

In addition, we developed a wide range of predictor variables for past tense verb performance encoding various kinds of frequency, phonological, and semantic information for individual verbs, including a number of novel measures. To achieve this, we coded 300 different verbs for 58 predictor variables. These predictors, where appropriate, were entered into a principle components analysis to derive a series of composite measures that characterised the set of verbs. These composite variables were then entered into a series of multilevel analyses to predict the children's past tense performance. The results reveal complex interactions between the variables that change over the course of development, providing insights into how the system builds up.

Finally, we developed a connectionist model to simulate the children's data. The model consisted of three input/output layers corresponding to input phonology, output phonology, and input/output semantics (what the model is &amp;quot;hearing&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;saying&amp;quot;, and the verb meanings presented to the model respectively) and one large bank of hidden units connecting them. The two tasks were simulated as either &amp;quot;inflection from form&amp;quot; (standard picture inflection task) or &amp;quot;inflection from meaning&amp;quot; (video-inflection task) whereby the model was presented with the present tense/semantic representation of the verb respectively. The model accurately reproduced the task and developmental differences seen in the children, demonstrating that a unified frequency-sensitive system of phonological and semantic networks can explain the variable performance we see in children at different developmental stages.

Together, these new methods, resources and theoretical insights provide much needed evidence of how children's knowledge of morphological systems develops, and important tools for the further investigation of critical questions in language acquisition research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>First, these findings may be used to inform researchers and practitioners' understanding of how children's knowledge of morphological systems develops, and how this might go wrong in atypical development. Summaries of children's performance on individual verbs and sub-groups of verbs could be used to inform SLT practice. The PI is in discussions with the RCSLT to find the best ways to facilitate the dissemination of information.

Second, these findings are likely to be of interest to Early Years practitioners, especially in the context of enhanced Early Years provision for two-year-olds. A greater awareness of language development within the 2-3yr age group has been signalled as an area for targeted training. The PI is working with a number of Greater Manchester childcare providers to establish how researcher input can best inform their practice.

Third, members of the public typically express interest in understanding the errors children make and their origins. The PI has delivered a series of talks as part of the University Widening Participation initiative, informing sixth form students, staff, and the wider public about children's past tense production. 

Finally, the findings are also likely to be of interest to practitioners working with adults with acquired aphasia. Many of the errors we see in early childhood also appear during language attrition. The Co-I is investigating ways in which our findings can best be communicated to this audience to inform clinical practice.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C424E6E2-284B-467D-A532-005CF5F207D7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55154d605f6c44.96591556</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>50B5433C-7AC3-4EC3-B12D-19120AD87CC0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The
