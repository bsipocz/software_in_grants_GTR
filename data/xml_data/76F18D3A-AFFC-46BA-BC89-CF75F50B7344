Children with ASCs have marked difficulties in social interaction and communication skills and in performing tasks that require initiation of and responding to social actions, such as imitation, turn-taking and collaborative (joint) actions. Many children with ASCs go on to experience a life-time of unemployment and often severe mental health difficulties. There is no cure for ASCs. However, early intervention and consistent support that is also sustained over time and contexts is paramount to improving the child's ability to cope with social situations and, to enhancing their and their caregivers' quality of life, and outlook. Provision of consistent and sustainable support for children in and outside of school is advocated by the autism best practice community and by many schools with specialist provisions for ASC pupils. Modern interventions emphasise consistent support across contexts, and for teachers and parents to share the management of goals for each child through co-creation of learning experiences. Increasingly, teachers and parents look to technology as an effective complimentary intervention that, thanks to growing affordability and efficacy of mobile and cloud computing may provide the basic infrastructure for a continuous and sustainable link between the support given to children at home and at school.

Recently there has been a massive growth in TEIs for Autism, but as with previous teaching-learning innovations, design and research have evolved in a sequential manner, with little direct influence on practice and limited research having been conducted in real-world classrooms. Maturing mobile and cloud computing make an open system for intervention creation and delivery in school and at home viable. Given the calls from the autism best practice community for such an open platform, they make it also necessary, relevant and timely. Artificial Intelligence techniques such as machine learning and gaze-tracking, which are increasingly embedded in everyday technologies, can transform such open platforms from places where ideas and experiences are exchanged, to places that can be co-created dynamically. 

The objective of SHARE-IT is to systematically investigate how different personal and mobile devices can be used individually and together to create a scalable intelligent learning environment for children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs). The overarching aim is to facilitate continuity of support for children across school, home and other relevant contexts. SHARE-IT has two research questions: (Q1): Can the efficacy of autism interventions be optimized by using technology to interface across school, home and the child's existing therapeutic regime?; (Q2): How can such technological infrastructure be sustained over time through a combination of (i) continuous, voluntary input from teachers and parents and (ii) the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to the real-time tracking and logging of children's behaviours in naturalistic environments?

The potential impact of SHARE-IT is significant as its findings, along with the research process itself, can affect many people in many contexts: teachers in how they deliver support to children at school; parents in how they help their children at home in a way that is consistent with school intervention and in how they cope with the significant demands of caring for a child with an ASC; children in being offered a tailored and on-demand support. Undertaking research in the wild under the EPSRC is crucial to achieving SHARE-IT's ambitions because this mechanism caters for both the engineering effort required and the crucial involvement of stakeholders in the process of creating technology that is relevant and useful to them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>SHARE-IT's aim is to make a difference to the lives of children on the autism spectrum and their parents, by exploring how cutting-edge technologies can be deployed best to improve communication between school and home, and to facilitate co-creation and co-ownership of learning experiences by parents, children and teachers. Technology, when used in the right way, can inspire and motivate children who can be otherwise difficult to engage. It can be used also to actively involve parents in their children's development and learning and provide alternative ways for teachers to tailor the support to the individual children's needs. The potential impact of SHARE-IT is significant as its findings, along with the research process itself, can affect many people in many contexts: teachers in how they deliver support to children at school; parents in how they help their children at home in a way that is consistent with school intervention and in how they cope with the significant demands of caring for a child with an ASC; children in being offered a tailored and on-demand support. 

Our work with teachers will contribute to their professional development and we will work with them to find best ways to operationalize the SHARE-IT infrastructure. Involvement of parents at the same time as teachers and children is crucial to understanding the dynamics of school-home communication and the respective roles of the different stakeholders in this communication. Such understanding is necessary for researchers to tailor the technology aimed to support such school-home links, and by teachers and parents to co-ordinate the support they give to the children. The involvement of parents on SHARE-IT brings also another dimension - that of parent education, literacy and empowerment in relation to their children's futures. Specifically, successful involvement of parents from lower income and education backgrounds, as planned in SHARE-IT, can have profoundly positive impact on their and their children's aspirations and success, but will require additional and specially tailored training to enable the parents to take part in the research. 

SHARE-IT's industrial partnership is an opportunity to influence the future development of and market for personal and mobile technologies with gaze tracking and Artificial Intelligence that addresses real-life needs of a growing population with ASCs. Our partner has an unrivaled insight into the future commercial potential of home eye tracking systems and will advise SHARE-IT on all aspects of commercialization throughout the project. 

SHARE-IT will support collaboration in which academics and non- academics, including our industrial partner, will have the time and scope to build connections as they work together, thereby contributing to instrumental, conceptual and capacity building impact. Instrumental, because we want to influence practice of using technology in creative and exploratory ways to encourage social communication and social skills for children through co-ordinated, informed and equal collaboration between teachers and parents; Conceptual, because we aim to identify the role of school-home communication through advanced intelligent technologies and how such technologies support continuity of experience between different contexts; Capacity building, because through the process of the work, we will be involved in increasing children's and parents' technological skills and learning as well as developing the technical and pedagogical skills of teachers. We will also facilitate knowledge exchange between the users and the industry, to enable industrial partners to develop an understanding of the real needs and potential of the technologies developed by them. As researchers, we will also develop our own skills and expertise in intelligent technology-enhanced interventions design and use in multiple contexts and in addressing how to engage in successful knowledge exchange.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>241598</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>1 day workshop with autism education teachers in India Hyderabad</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BFE70BCC-21BC-4108-9D89-E1B49D32741E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a 2 1-day workshops with teachers in Hyderabad, India on technology-enhanced learning for autism, and specifically on the use and design of the SHARE-IT environment for use in schools in India.

The need for flexible and authorable technologies which lend themselves to being customised in terms of their look-and-feel, their content and the behaviours of the intelligent components (user model and autonomous agent capabilities) have been highlighted as the key requirements for a truly useful technology for education in the context of autism interventions. These findings form the basis for the team's work in this area and have been utilised in further projects, including the UCL Institute of Education funded TESSA project and the unLOCKE project jointly funded by the Education Endowment Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. 

The UCL Institute of Education provided the team with small funding (&amp;pound;26K) to undertake knowledge exchange (the TESSA project) with researchers and users in India to ascertain the fit of technologies such as SHARE-IT along with their clinical and educational underpinnings to cultural contexts other than the western Anglo-saxon ones (UK and the US). TESSA evaluated SHARE-IT in India, where the team worked with researchers from IIIT-Hyderabad, as well as teachers, parents and children to establish the necessary and sufficient requirements for SHARE-IT's cross-cultural applicability and its use. The technology proved popular with children and teachers in India, and it also proved flexible enough to allow the teachers to tailor the support given to children around it. The team is in the process of analysing substantial qualitative data that emerged from the TESSA studies and we will be reporting on the outcomes in due course.

The Wellcome Trust and Endowment Educational Foundation supported project (unLOCKE: Learning Counterintuitive Concepts) is a substantial project (&amp;pound;1M) which focuses on the design and evaluation of neuroscientific intervention in 100 schools in the UK. It aims to help primary school children in developing inhbition control (a 'stop and think' behaviour) with respect to counterintuitive concepts in mathematics and science. As part of the evaluation of the unLOCKE's neuroscience intervention, the team has developed a computerised actove control to compare it to the main intervention. This active control, called See+, builds directly on the SHARE-IT software and ideas in relation to supporting children in dveloping social awareness and social interaction skills.

Other researchers are utilising SHARE-IT platform as the basis for their research, demonstrating clearly that the investment in a robust and extendable technology brings many benefits in contexts not originally envisaged as contexts of application. For example researchers at the Baby Lab, Birkbeck College, Psychological Sciences are utilising SHARE-IT as their intervention platform for pre-school children at risk of autism. Several other researchers expressed active interest in utilising the platform for their own research, opening up several research opportunities for the team and for extending the technology and its uses beyond its original goals.

It is also important to note that SHARE-IT represents an important step in what the team considers a developing research programme in the area of intelligent technologies and the related knowledge engineering methods for education, with ECHOES (RES-139-25-0322), ECHOES 2 (RES-139-25-0395) and Shape (RES/J011207/1) projects constituting distinct steps and intellectual leaps which allowed the team to arrive at a technology and its application that is encapsulated in SHARE-IT. Through all these projects, leading up to SHARE-IT, it has become apparent that the methods used not only to engage the users in the participatory design, but also the knowledge elicitation and engineering have an important role to play in enhancing teachers own evidence-based practices, offering greater rigour of inquiry and an ability to share evidence with a wider educational community. Members of the team are disseminating these findings as part of their teaching at the Institute of Education and Birmingham University's School of Education as well as working with individual schools (e.g. Barrow Hills Primary School, Topcliffe Primary School) to develop guidelines for technology enhanced learning and evidence-based practice.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>504BA8C0-B1D3-4956-A9D6-76CB823E0B25</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546323032fdb61.68236062</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The SHARE-IT project focused on participatory design research with schools, parents and industry through which it aimed to formulate the requirements for a robust, intelligent and authorable serious game for supporting children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) in exploring, practicing and acquiring social interaction skills. SHARE-IT built on the ECHOES project (ESRC/EPSRC funded), in which a computer game for children with ASCs was designed and evaluated. 

SHARE-IT's chief focus was in addressing challenges identified through the ECHOES project and other related projects that relate to the need for (a) a robust system architecture and implementation of educational technologies and (b) for a considered selection of appropriate technologies and techniques to allow for multi-device and operating system deployment, the development of an intelligent (in the Artificial Intelligence sense) computer game needed to support social interaction, and flexibility for the environment to be authored by lay persons. 

The key findings of the project relate to the inextricable nature of the relationship between user involvement in the design and software implementation of the technology. Specifically, in order to sustain the motivation of the users to participate in the technology design projects, it seems paramount that such projects actually produce the technology that can be used promptly and reliably. This necessitates a fast shift from low-fidelity, paper and pen prototypes, to implemented, manipulable systems representing the designs that can be appraised in quick design-implementation-test cycles. As well as the need for a degree of immediacy in the way that the designs are realised in the technology, the project also highlighted the need to reconsider the timescale of the design process from that confined to specific projects' duration to one which allows users to engage in continuous design and re-design of technology independently of the researchers and software engineers. This particular finding has profound implications for necessary requirements that a technology must fulfil in order to be fit for real-world educational use. 

Apart from the pedagogically sound underpinning, aimed to ensure relevance of the technology to the educational contexts, other requirements include: (1) industry-standard software engineering of the technology to ensure reliability of the system during day-to-day usage (2) portability of the software between different devices and operating systems (3) authoring capabilities for non-technical users, including teachers, parents and children, to ensure extendibility of the software capabilities beyond those which may be desirable and/or identified before or during a project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has been a very important step for the team in helping them understand the specific needs of the users of technologies such as SHARE-IT in their native contexts (home and school). The need for flexible and authorable technologies which lend themselves to being customised in terms of their look-and-feel, their content and the behaviours of the intelligent components (user model and autonomous agent capabilities) have been highlighted as the key requirements for a truly useful technology for education in the context of autism interventions. These findings will be taken as the basis for the team's funding proposal to invest in the authoring capabilities in SHARE-IT that allow for the behaviours of the agent as well as for the user models to be modified by the users (teachers, parents and children). 

The SHARE-IT platform developed during the project is already being utilised in other funded and unfunded projects. Specifically, the Institute of Education provided the team with small funding to undertake knowledge exchange (the TESSA project) with researchers and users in India to ascertain the fit of technologies such as SHARE-IT along with their clinical and educational underpinnings to cultural contexts other than the western Anglo-saxon ones (UK and the US). TESSA evaluated SHARE-IT in India, where the team worked with researchers from IIIT-Hyderabad, as well as teachers, parents and children to establish the necessary and sufficient requirements for SHARE-IT cross-cultural applicability and its use.

The Wellcome Trust and Endowment Educational Foundation supported project (unLOCKE) is substantial project which focuses on the design and evaluation of neuroscientific intervention in 100 schools in the UK. It's aim is to develop a computer based intervention to help primary school children learn counterintuitive concepts in mathematics and science. SHARE-IT provides the platform for delivering the intervention, allowing the unLOCKE project to build both on the technology developed through SHARE-IT, its design methods and findings.

The ideas as well as the technological designs explored and trialed during the SHARE-IT project serve as the starting point for a set of further research programmes currently under development. Specifically the ideas around building technologies that are authorable and malleable for different contexts of use provide a key focus for further research grant applications involving a much wider and new interdisciplinary collaborations, involving stakeholders from different areas of engineering, social sciences and art including architecture, and ethics and a larger set of beneficiaries and users than would have been possible prior to this project.
