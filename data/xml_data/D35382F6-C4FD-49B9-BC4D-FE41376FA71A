This policy and approach is important because a healthy natural environment is indispensable to current and future economic prosperity - it is a vital part of the infrastructure of a successful modern economy. Conserving the natural environment is an efficient and effective way to deliver a wide range of benefits to society, but because many ecosystem services are not adequately reflected in our day-to-day decisions, they are all too often ignored. The pace of environmental degradation is accelerating in many cases and this is jeopardizing our ability to meet future challenges, such as coping with climate change and
addressing concerns over food, water and energy security. Investing in a healthy natural environment is essential and an ecosystems approach can help tackle future challenges in a way that enhances prosperity. Innovative ecological, as
well as technological, solutions have a vital role to play.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D85633B1-0C89-4F16-88BF-D9EE83834C4A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544a9deb38acd2.96052451</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The central problem in developing and applying metrics for sustainability and payments for ecosystem services is not the methodology of creating a metric or value, but rather how that numerical indicator is inserted into the policy process.
