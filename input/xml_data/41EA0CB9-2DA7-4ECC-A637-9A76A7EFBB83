Great demands are made of teachers at secondary schools to teach complex linguistic and grammatical concepts, as laid down in the NC. They have understandable difficulties with this, given the very limited linguistic training they have received at teacher training college. Regarding the lack of expertise in grammar teaching Hudson&amp;amp;Walmsley write:\n\n'Most younger teachers know very little grammar and are suspicious of explicit grammar teaching. Not surprisingly, therefore, new recruits entering teacher-training courses typically either know very little grammar (Williamson&amp;amp;Hardman 1995) or have no confidence in their knowledge, presumably because they have picked it up in an unsystematic way (Cajkler&amp;amp;Hislam 2002). This situation raises obvious problems for the implementation of the official programme.' (Hudson&amp;amp;Walmsley 2005)\n\nThe pupils also have difficulties with learning complex grammatical concepts, because typically, in the tradition of grammar teaching, invented examples are used. They find these difficult to relate to real linguistic settings and almost impossible to apply to their own language production. In this context a recent coursebook notes that:\n\n'Invented sentences like the ones so often used in textbooks are just sterile fragments of that wonderfully rich language they are supposed to be identifying' (B&amp;ouml;rjars&amp;amp;Burridge 2001)\n\nIn order to address these problems for teachers and students we wish to create specific tools for the teaching and learning of the English language based on the existing high quality research of the Survey of English Usage at University College London.The proposed project will result in a dynamic web-based platform for the teaching and learning of the English language, specifically grammar. Examples of English language phenomena will be sourced dynamically from an underlying collection of English language materials (a 'corpus'). This corpus i fully grammatically analysed, and contains a very wide range of real contemporary English, both written and spoken. The spoken material has been transcribed word-for-word, and the audio data will be available from the same web database. Hitherto our resources have only been used for academic research. We now wish to make our research output available to a wider audience, specifically secondary schools in the London Borough of Camden, but also, at a later stage, schools and libraries nationwide.\n\nOur partner is the School Improvement Service (SIS) of the London Borough of Camden. Its aims are to raise standards and improve the quality of teaching and learning in English in an ethnically and socially diverse inner-London community. \n\nThe UCL and SIS teams will establish a focus group which will meet twice early on during the project to discuss the problems teachers face in delivering the National Curriculum programme and their Continuous Professional Development needs. The aim will be to determine the content requirements of the envisaged teaching and learning platform. The discussions will inform the content of the course modules that the UCL team will develop. At a later stage the SIS will establish links with five secondary schools in Camden, such that the team can test the resulting platform in a classroom setting. The feedback will inform the final stage of the project during which the UCL team will implement the suggested changes and enhancements. At the end of the project the partners convene, together with school teachers, to review and evaluate the completed platform and documentation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to develop teaching and learning resources for the English language on the web. It will enable the research team at the Survey of English Usage (SEU; an English language research unit at University College London) to transfer its knowledge and expertise in the English language directly to the local community, specifically secondary schools in the London Borough of Camden (LBC). It will give teachers the tools to deliver the National Curriculum's teaching and learning programme in English, and will help pupils to learn the curriculum faster, more effectively and with greater enjoyment. The project will enable our partner, the School Improvement Service (SIS) of the Children, Schools and Families Directorate of the London Borough of Camden to reach its strategic goals, namely to raise standards and improve the quality of teaching and learning in English. In a part of London where 47% of secondary school pupils are speakers of English as an Additional Language (EAL), often from deprived backgrounds, the project will have a major impact on the pupils' levels of literacy and command of the English language. In this way a local public service is improved in collaboration with a local university. There will thus be an immediate impact in the teaching and learning of English in the community, measurable through the pupils' results in English tests and examinations. The development of the learning resources will be the responsibility of the team at UCL who will set up a focus group at the beginning of the project with the SIS whose role will be to identify problem areas in the teaching of English and Continuous Professional Development needs. Towards the end of the project the SIS will act as a gateway for the UCL team to contact five schools in Camden whose teachers and pupils will evaluate the resources. Some contacts with schools and practitioners in the field have already been established. Both partners can thus be seen to be crucially involved in bringing about the envisaged impact of the project.\n\nWe hope that a wider community will be able to benefit from the teaching and learning resources, building on our experiences in London. This can be done by making the proposed website available nationwide, so that it can benefit teachers and pupils all over the UK. More generally, the resource can be made available in libraries for use by the general public via the People's Network (www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk). This is a web portal provided by 3,100 public libraries and 460 mobile libraries, and visited by 274m users during 2002/3. To bring this about we hope to work with a commercial partner. The SEU has links with publishers of English Language Teaching materials, one of which has already expressed an interest in working with us. The details of a potential commercial collaboration would be explored at the end of the project when we can present our platform to a commercial partner. We would be helped with this by UCL Business PLC which is dedicated to developing emerging technologies which have commercial applications, aiming to bring innovation to the market. The impact of the project can thus be seen to be far-reaching and lasting.\n\nThe resource will be made available over the web by the SEU. With the help of UCL's Press Office it will be publicised widely and brought to the attention of the media, teachers' associations, professional publications, libraries, LEAs, etc.\n\nThe SEU has 50 years of experience in building databases of English language materials in spoken and written form. It has a global track record in developing dedicated software for the exploration of such databases, and has experience in developing web-based teaching materials. It is in an ideal position to make its rich resources available to local, national and global communities. The resources will be supported by the SEU beyond the life of</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>290248</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Grammar Practice Key Stage 2</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EAFF0530-5938-48F6-8E55-3A8D06185DE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Grammar Practice Key Stage 2 is an app developed for school children to practise English grammar.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5898e43488efe4.90298661</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/grammar-practice-ks2/id1102728781?mt=8</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Glamour of Grammar</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0DC85C9D-ED69-4730-9098-23B5EE05E9AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop for secondary schools teachers
