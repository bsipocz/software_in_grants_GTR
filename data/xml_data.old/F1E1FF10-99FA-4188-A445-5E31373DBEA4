AD 43- 410). This period represents a time of major change in Britain: the Roman conquest resulted in the creation of military settlements, towns, a complex road system, specialised craft production, markets, long-distance trade, and the emergence of new social classes. In terms of food, it brought new consumers (people not involved in agricultural production), and new foods, such as grapes, figs, olives, peach, almond, coriander, cucumber, and black pepper, introduced from the Mediterranean region and beyond. What effect did these new developments have? Was this a period of major diversification and change in diet? Do the newly imported foods replace the traditional ones, or do the latter become consumed exclusively by certain groups of the population? Do the new consumers distinguish themselves from the rural community in terms of diet? Since many of the new foods were initially expensive, difficult to obtain and consequently only available to the elite, did they remain exclusive foods throughout the period or did their status change over time? Did any become commonly available and even locally cultivated?

The project concerns the analysis of the botanical food remains recovered from Roman period excavations in Britain, consisting of c. 550 published reports. The objective is to write three research papers, synthesizing and interpreting the available evidence for a non-specialist audience. One will represent an overall synthesis of the changes in the British diet over this period, evaluating both cultural and environmental factors influencing the choice of food and assessing the degree to which food helped create or enhance cultural identities. The second paper will focus on the dispersal histories of the exotic foods brought in and assess the degree of differential access to these foods. The third will evaluate the quality of the data currently available for this study, and highlight future research and methodological needs.


Food is both a biological and social need for all human societies, and the roots of our current diet are located in history. This research will advance our understanding of the first major period of change in the British diet since the Neolithic. Moreover, as food is both a manifestation of social identity and a tool with which social identities and relations are created, maintained and enhanced, this study will also add to our knowledge of Romano-British society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24628</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Marked diversity and change in plant food consumption has been identified, demonstrating how archaeobotanical data, like other forms of material culture, can make a significant contribution to our understanding of Roman Britain and other provinces. A study of foodstuffs through their connection with the individual, the social group and the productive economy can enhance the archaeological and historical narrative of the Roman Empire.



In this case study the introduction of some 50 new food plants into Britain during the Roman period (ca. AD1-410) was studied. Key findings concern evidence for a marked broadening of the British diet, bringing essential nutrients, variety of flavours and dishes, as well as new opportunities for wealth acquisition and display. These foods were used in the creation and maintenance of identity and several new consumer groups could be identified. Some individuals and groups were able to take advantage of the new foods, while others either could not or chose not to. London stands out as the place with the highest access to the new foods including many of the rare foods, followed by the military settlements, and the other major towns. In terms of the rural sites, there is a marked regional pattern with only those located in the central and south-eastern part of the country gaining access to the new foods, matching other evidence of agricultural development and wealth accumulation. But within this region there are marked differences between sites that gain access and those that do not, which may, of course, partly be an issue of sampling and preservation biases, but may also reflect genuine differences in the degree of aspiration, economic opportunity and success in 'becoming Roman'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9352F875-96A8-4472-8614-C1C1A1C7BD4B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9300880282.466188774cb096</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture/ Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7846EA49-F53D-4D30-8123-AC3C2EB1BE9B</gtr:id><gtr:title>New Plant Foods in Roman Britain - Dispersal and Social Access</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental Archaeology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/df0e0ab928992cb43ab878e0bc8364e6"><gtr:id>df0e0ab928992cb43ab878e0bc8364e6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van der Veen M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d07a07afa58dcb</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>324F6FAD-41AF-4200-85AF-A85DEEB0FAFA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Food as embodied material culture: diversity and change in plant food consumption in Roman Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Roman Archaeology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/df0e0ab928992cb43ab878e0bc8364e6"><gtr:id>df0e0ab928992cb43ab878e0bc8364e6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van der Veen M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b6bbd863b58.77996511</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>49F82EE0-BB62-41B5-9ACA-6CB072547FB8</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Archaeobotany of Roman Britain: Current State and Identification of Research Priorities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Britannia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/df0e0ab928992cb43ab878e0bc8364e6"><gtr:id>df0e0ab928992cb43ab878e0bc8364e6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van der Veen M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b6ae37fdd80.85460491</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D500613/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology of Literate Soc.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
