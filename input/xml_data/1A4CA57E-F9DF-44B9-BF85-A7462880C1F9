In particular, the selective formation of carbon-carbon bonds in aromatic and heteroaromatic systems is one of the most important goals in synthesis as aromatic scaffolds form the structural basis of many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials.

A range of metal-catalyzed cross-coupling processes - now familiar to every practising chemist worldwide - have been developed to address the formation of these particular carbon-carbon bonds and the resultant benefits for society have been remarkable. In recognition, the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Heck, Negishi and Suzuki &amp;quot;for palladium-catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis&amp;quot;. More recently, methods for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds to sites on an aromatic ring with substitution of a C-H bond, rather than a halide (so called &amp;quot;C-H activation&amp;quot;) have been developed. Such processes are highly desirable as the starting materials are often more available, inexpensive and processes usually generate less waste.

The majority of these 'classical' and 'cutting-edge' cross-coupling processes have one thing in common: they are mediated by expensive late transition metals (e.g. ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum). Unfortunately, the supply of these metals is at risk and their use will become unsustainable in the future. An important course, therefore, involves the development of coupling reactions that do not involve the use of a metal. Such an approach has additional benefits, as trace metal contamination in products arising from metal-catalyzed processes is a major problem in industry - particularly the pharmaceutical and organic electronic industries.

During my Fellowship project I will develop metal-free processes that complement existing metal-catalyzed cross-coupling technologies and could eventually lead to their replacement. Readily-accessible aromatic and heteroaromatic systems will be used in metal-free cross-couplings with electron-rich carbon-based partners. Our strategy will use a sulfoxide directing group on the aromatic ring to orchestrate carbon-carbon bond formation at the position next door: sulfur will catch the incoming carbon coupling partner before passing it to the aromatic ring. Thus, an easy carbon-sulfur bond forming event will be used to trigger the formation of a more-challenging carbon-carbon bond, with substitution of a hydrogen on the aromatic ring (so called &amp;quot;C-H substitution&amp;quot;). The aromatic and heteroaromatic sulfoxide starting materials are very easy to make by oxidation of a wide-range of commercially available sulfides. Importantly, the sulfur directing group in our approach can be viewed as a 'safety-catch' directing group: the sulfur in the starting material lies dormant and only upon oxidation to the sulfoxide is the substrate 'switched on' and becomes receptive to metal-free cross-coupling. During the coupling, the sulfur directing group is reduced and the directing effect is 'switched-off'. This 'safety-catch' feature leads to many advantages: for example, premature reaction or over reduction of the substrate is impossible.

The products of the metal-free couplings are of high value in their own right and are also ripe for manipulation. For example, metal-free conversion to industrially-important benzothiophene motifs is possible. To illustrate the great potential of our metal-free approach to cross-coupling we will apply the technology in the synthesis and modification of functional molecules, organic materials and bioactive targets: syntheses that would usually be carried out using supply-risk late transition metals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The selective formation of C-C bonds in aromatic and heteroaromatic systems is one of the most important goals in organic chemistry as aromatic scaffolds form the structural basis of many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and industrial materials.

More recently, methods for the formation of C-C bonds to sites on an aromatic ring with substitution of a C-H bond, rather than a halide/pseudohalide (so called &amp;quot;C-H activation&amp;quot;) have been developed. Such processes are highly desirable as the starting materials are often more available, inexpensive and processes may be highly atom-economical, generating less waste.

The majority of 'classical' and 'cutting-edge' cross-couplings have one thing in common: they are mediated by expensive late transition metals (e.g. ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum). Unfortunately, the supply of these metals is at risk and their use will become unsustainable. An important future course, therefore, involves the development of coupling reactions that do not involve the use of a metal. Such an approach has additional benefits, as trace metal contamination in products arising from metal-catalyzed processes is a major problem in industry - particularly the pharmaceutical and organic electronic industries.

The project will deliver innovative, new metal-free carbon-carbon bond-forming processes involving important aromatic and heteroaromatic substrates that exploit an intriguing strategy and proceed by new mechanisms. Some of these couplings are C-H/C-H-type couplings - arguably the most desirable class of cross-coupling process.

In the short term, this project will provide valuable tools for synthetic chemists in their day-to-day work in industrial laboratories and plants. More specific beneficiaries include the pharmaceutical, biotech, biopharmaceutical, agrochemical, organic electronic industries, and custom research organizations. The selective synthetic technology developed during our studies will allow chemists to improve future processes, streamline routes and avoid the metal contamination of products. Our work will therefore improve economic competitiveness and aid wealth creation in the UK. The timescale for impact will be short, with benefits arising 1-2 years after the completion of the project. Our track record in method development leaves us uniquely placed to meet the objectives of the project and to achieve the predicted impact. In the long term, the development of metal-free coupling processes is crucial for the advancement of science long after the supply of late-transition metals is compromised.

As carbon-carbon bond forming methods are indispensible tools for scientists in established (pharmaceutical, agrochemical) and emerging (organic electronics, biotech/biopharmaceutical) industries in the UK (and beyond), our fundamental studies on metal-free couplings are aligned with the needs of UK industry (and academia) and the EPSRC portfolio (Physical Sciences: &amp;quot;Dial-a-molecule&amp;quot; Physical Science Grand Challenge; Chemical Biology and Biological Chemistry; Materials for Energy Applications. Healthcare Technologies: Diagnostics). In particular, my Fellowship will focus on two of the three themes identified in the &amp;quot;Dial-a-molecule&amp;quot; Roadmap: &amp;quot;A Step Change in Molecular Synthesis&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Catalytic Paradigms for Efficient Synthesis&amp;quot;. In doing so, my work will attempt to break down a key barrier to progress identified in the roadmap - &amp;quot;Sustainable synthesis for a sustainable future&amp;quot;. The roadmap also highlights that &amp;quot;the long-term security of precious metal supplies creates a further challenge&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;much catalysis for fine chemical synthesis relies upon precious metals which are nearing depletion&amp;quot;. Our plans will directly address this urgent challenge.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1146757</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has only just begun.
