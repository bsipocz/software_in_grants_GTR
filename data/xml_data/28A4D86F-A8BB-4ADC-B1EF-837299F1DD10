Furthermore changes are afoot in the Arab world and we need to be able to capitalise on these changes for cultural, economic and social reasons. This will require specific skill sets eg an understanding of Islam that is positive, cultural literacy about diverse Muslim communities and Arabic language fluency - skills which may be developed as part of such collaborations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will run four regional knowledge exchange seminars and an academic conference.These seminars and conferences will bring together academics, practitioners and employers in an environment that is conducive to sharing experiences and opinions.This process of knowledge-sharing will lead to enhanced understandings of good practice and also clarify and suggest solutions to potential obstacles.Through these consultations we hope to achieve a critical mass of information that may encourage increased collaborations and related benefits for all stakeholders involved.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The knowledge exchange facilitated by this project will benefit research users within and beyond academia. Study of Islam and Muslim communities has evolved into a wide-ranging and multi-disciplinary genre that impacts areas such as academia, social policy, equality and diversity and legal frameworks. Within Britain there are demands for better, more inclusive understandings of Islam and the West. Changes in the Arab world will create emerging markets, increase competitiveness among Western powers for these new markets and require trade activity that is underpinned by understandings of Islam. There are five types of main players who can bring more cohesion to Britain and more competitiveness in foreign trade and policy:

1. Academics and Scholars involved in Islamic Studies, and sociological studies of Muslim communities and Islamic Sciences: Currently only four partnerships exist in Britain between universities and Muslim colleges. There is scope, demand and interest to set up further such partnerships. There is interest in pedagogic and contextual cross-overs, however obstacles persist. This project will bring scholars from both sides of this perceived dichotomy to discuss, suggest and validate ways to increase such collaborations and efficiency. Courses facilitated through such linkages could bring together confessional and academic approaches to the study of Islam thus building bridges between these approaches.

2. Policy makers: The increasing visibility of diverse populations in British cities and legislation around equalities necessitates that local and national governments have frameworks for community cohesion. Government agendas around Equalities (particularly with regard to religion or belief), Community Cohesion and Preventing Violent Extremism specifically seek to consult and collaborate with Muslim communities. We believe linkages between universities and Muslim institutions could facilitate knowledge exchange, training and development of 'experts' and ongoing policy-led research.

3. Employers: In sectors such as chaplaincy, counselling, community work, interfaith and also work in foreign countries, there is a need for professionals who are aware of clients' religious beliefs. There is also an increase in employers' needs for Arabic expertise. The Worton Report (2009) asserts the need for Arabic for business (Para. 46), and notes that at the time of writing the report, 15% of employers actively seek Arabic speakers who also understand the cultural and business norms of Britain and of Arabic speaking countries (Para. 110). Dickens and Watson (2006) note increasing interest in Arabic both by students and prospective employers.

4. Students wish to have recognised qualifications and employable skills: Majida a young ambitious Muslim woman explains she would like to be perceived as a qualified professional who can work not just with the Muslim community but also in other communities, 'to create awareness about Islam and clarify misconceptions'. But she knows that, 'without recognition (validation) we are limited to the Muslim community' (Mukadam et al (2010): 28). There is a perceived need from within the British Muslim community to develop new courses with could equip the community with faith and social leadership that is engrained in British values and systems

5. UK universities and Muslim institutions: In the longer term it is envisaged that there will be economic benefits to the academic sector, because the research findings reveal a new client base: our three research projects identify a strong desire on the part of British Muslims for hybrid courses within the university sector, even among many of those who have attended traditional dar ul ulooms (Islamic Seminaries). Universities and Muslim institutions will benefit from additional income streams created by collaborative partnerships. Previous experience indicates that international students are also attracted to such courses.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76296</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Muslims in Britain Research Network (MBRN)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MBRN Islam and Peaceful Relations conference</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7577A97-AF2B-471F-9648-910506CE8986</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference - http://www.mbrn.org.uk/conference-islam-and-peaceful-relations/</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c4fd0e1838a7.25830021-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>They provided administrative support in following areas:

Quality Control on Muslim institutions was described as bureaucratic however as participants continued their discussions they felt that they better understood the need for such stringent quality measures and felt that it would be helpful for the successful running of courses.

Participants said that it would be helpful for such discussions to continue, as academics and Muslim community experts do not always have the opportunity to come together and talk about such social issues

However based on participant feedback and discussion at our knowledge exchange events and conferences we report a few findings (which are discussed in the 'key findings' section). The main objective of this project ES/J020842/1 was to disseminate the findings of our previous research. This was achieved through a programme of knowledge exchange and dissemination activities which are ongoing and continue beyond the formal duration of the project. 
This project has allowed the project team to maintain, develop and sustain existing working relationships with Muslim institutions in Britain and to broker new relationships between universities and Muslim institutions. We now have a critical mass of academics in both universities and Muslim institutions who are aware of partnerships are who are keen to dismantle roadblocks.
We believe that the engagement we achieved has led to new thinking and some tangible improvements in:
? public policy, by providing new paradigms for Islamic Studies courses in higher education
? culture and quality of life by replacing friction caused by fear of terrorism with new behaviour that facilitates interfaith dialogue

A few research outcomes which were not previously anticipated include:
1. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) awarded this team &amp;pound;750 to run a symposium on Islamic Studies Pedagogy in Britain: Interrogating the Secular and the Sacred on 4th March 2014, at the Multi-faith Centre University of Derby. A blog about this work can be accessed here: http://blogs.heacademy.ac.uk/arts-and-humanities/2014/10/29/islamic-studies-pedagogy-in-britain-interrogating-the-secular-and-the-sacred/ 
2. As a result of discussions with various stakeholders, a community group and Muslim institution the Al-Mahdi Institution has offered financial support to organise a Sunni-Shia intra-faith dialogue session on higher education. 
3. All three Muslim institutions that currently have strong partnerships (MIHE, Al-Makhtoum and Islamic College) have reported that they used our project report and findings either while sourcing new collaborative partners (MIHE and Al-Maktoum) or while recruiting external examiners (Islamic College).
4. As a result of the intellectual capital created by this project - ES/J020842/1, the research team is collaborating with academics from the universities of Lancaster (Shuruq Naguib) and Durham (Mathew Guest) to undertake further research about Islam and Muslims on campus. We have put in a joint grant application entitled 'Islam of Campus' under AHRC's 'Large Research Grant' scheme. This research application was successful and the project is underway

Summary information about this engagement is as follows: 
1. The invitations for the project events and conferences were sent to over 7000 individuals and organisations
2. The seminars were attended by approximate 150 individuals
3. The conferences were attended by approximately 120
4. All delegates received copies of the project interim report and executive summaries of the previous three projects
5. The project reports are being sent in hard copy to all university vice-chancellors in the UK
6. The project report and findings were sent to over 800 academics and research students via the academic networks.
7. A monograph entitled Islamic Education in Britain: New Pluralist Paradigms is in press, due to be published in mid 2015. This has been published and has been reviewed favourably
8. Two journal articles are currently work in progress
9. The PI and Co-I have made the following presentations based on the findings of the project:
? 7th Dec 2013, Socrel/HEA Symposium: Islam and the University Curriculum: Experiences of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, Imperial Wharf, London
? 7th - 10th November 2013, SSRC Conference, Boston
? 4th November 2013, Christian-Muslim forum event: Telling the Truth: about Muslim Identity in Britain, Westminster Abbey, London
? 10th - 11th April2014, BRAIS Conference, Edinburgh

We believed both parties could benefit at a time when the Arab parts of the Muslim world are beginning to demonstrate new potential for markets. Such markets require specific skill sets that require improved development in Britain e.g. understanding of Islam that is positive and Arabic language fluency. This process also satisfied British demands for more acceptance and integration of Islam with Britain. 

Four regional seminars were held to discuss our research findings with presentations from existing collaborative partners i.e. the few British universities and British Muslim colleges already working together. Discussions were recorded and quotations used, following ethical permission guidelines, to demonstrate opinions and ways forward. 

We considered future action with a range of stakeholders: policy makers, students, university representatives, Muslim colleges' representatives, local business people and communities. Four roundtable discussions were also held around four major issues as identified by these groups.

Impact was measured partly by holding two final national conferences to pool proposals. Impact was also measured by developing deliverable outcomes: deliverables consisted of building on existing links from our extensive existing research and creating networks of key stakeholders.

Since this was a follow-on project, we did not develop new research findings. However, based on participant feedback and discussion at our knowledge exchange events and conferences, we can report the following findings:
1. All delegates found the three research projects which provided the impetus for this follow-on work, to be useful for their work and influential for their future practice.
2. Participants at each knowledge exchange workshop and conference, unanimously endorsed our findings from these three research projects. They stressed the need for this work to continue, an assertion of the value of bringing people together who would otherwise not meet, and yet who can work together well, as these seminars demonstrate. 
3. Participants came from different professional and social backgrounds, and therefore had different expectations from the event, yet this initiative is perceived by all attendees as a positive move forward. 
4. Government was represented by members of the Prevent anti-extremist team, instead of by academic curriculum experts and policy makers. It was unfortunate that positive discussion about developing inclusive partnerships that are encouraging of cohesion and ultimately big society, did not receive the support it deserves from policy makers other than from those working within an anti-terror remit. Despite our best efforts, university participation was limited.
5. Most delegates understood that partnership between a university and a Muslim college is complex. Yet they believed that the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. They also raised several queries to be addressed in the on-going process of this important ESRC project, including:

? A proposal to create a steering group for the next phase of this work, 
? Acknowledgement of the need for new teaching methods, 
? The overriding and urgent need to bring together key figures from the Islamic and HE sectors and moving forward together. 
? Need for dialogue and sharing of expertise across all faith groups in Europe
6. Delegates and speakers believe this work has great potential for improving community cohesion, for offering a broader higher education for all and for validating Islamic theology courses within the UK quality assurance system. 
7. At each knowledge exchange workshop and conference the importance was demonstrated of developing collaborative partnerships between UK universities and Muslim institutions in Britain. This would thereby provide a richer higher education sector and greater higher education opportunities for all British citizens.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have published our findings in a monograph that has been favorably reviewed.
