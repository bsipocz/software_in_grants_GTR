As questions of land and water access rise up the policy agenda in southern Africa, a critical social science perspective is crucial to ask questions about how the nexus is governed. A focus on the politics of access will illuminate how different state, market and civil society actions can contribute to more effective access for the widest number of people. 

This is a crucial question for development, making this proposal firmly 'ODA compliant'. Resource scarcities can act to exclude certain groups - including the poor, women and others - from vital resources for livelihoods. Conflicts over resources may emerge when more powerful groups grab land and water in the pursuit of the commercialisation of agriculture, energy or environmental services. Thus understanding the relationships between changing capitalist relations in the context of development and resources is essential if pro-poor, development oriented orientations for environmental sustainability are to emerge in policy. 

In this project, we will examine the politics of access around the large-scale commercialisation of agriculture, water projects, including hydropower dams, and biodiversity conservation and forest carbon projects, where market offset mechanisms are applied. In each case our studies will examine the nexus between sectors, examining how relations between land, water and environment are negotiated in different governance frameworks. 

The partnership will be facilitated through a combination of staff and student exchanges, joint scoping activities and project proposal development, a small grants programme for students, and an international conference that will bring together academics, policymakers and activists working on 'nexus' themes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work will build on a long track record of engaged research in southern Africa by all applicants. A joint IDS-PLAAS project has been chosen as a winner of the ESRC's 2015 'Outstanding International Impact' award. All partner institutions have a strong communications and impact engagement capacity, and excellent web profiles and social media connections. The communications professionals IDS, PLAAS and ACTS already work together, and this partnership grant will foster this international impact and engagement capacity, linking the UK with Africa. 

In developing the partnership we will carry out a Participatory Impact Pathways Analysis (PIPA), an approach used at the STEPS Centre (Ely and Oxley 2014), as well as in PLAAS and ACTS. This will help us identify the key target groups for our engagement around different themes. We will then tailor communications activities to these groups, and involve them in the discussions about future research proposals (during scoping studies) and in the Nexus conference. 

Our aim is to generate useful evidence that is policy relevant, and that will make a difference in addressing complex nexus governance challenges. While this project is not carrying out research, its aims include generating new questions, and identifying key challenges. Involving users in this process is essential. All project partners have excellent contacts, across policy domains (land, water, environment) and in international organisations, among national policy makers, in business, and within civil society. For example, we will work closely with the Department of Rural Development and Land Affairs as well as the Department of Environmental Affairs in South Africa, as well as regional bodies, such as SADC and the African Union, and link with international organisations such as the UN bodies, FAO and UNEP. 

As part of the PIPA exercise, we will map these actors around three overlapping domains (land, water and environment). We will focus on South Africa, but aim to link to the wider region, where important lessons, and cross-border policy questions arise. Through the regional mapping process, we will identify key partners for joint, co-produced work as part of our network. Our key outputs - including the scoping studies, new project proposals, small grant reports and the final conference - will emerge from this conversation with diverse users - not all of whom will agree with our approach and analysis, but we hope will engage in a spirit of open, and challenging, debate. This engagement will start at the beginning of our work, at the proposed partner inception and planning workshop.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation: PLAAS - 'Black sands, green plans and the mining-conservation-conflict nexus in southern Madagascar'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0CBAE1D-591C-4039-A0E0-2EA205D51754</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research presentation to demonstrate the nexus approach based on 2 case studies, highlighting policy implications and resource relationships in the context of extractive investment in Africa.
