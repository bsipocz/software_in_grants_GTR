The project will transfer approaches developed in the 'Starting from Values: Evaluating Intangible Legacies' Connected Communities project to an established programme. 

The project will embed values-based approaches to identifying legacies within the Stories of Amazing Resilience (SOAR) and Gothkad (Happiness) Village projects led by GPIAtlantic and its local partner in Bhutan, the Youth Development Fund (YDF). These projects are part of the wider programme of developing Gross National Happiness pioneered in Bhutan. 
In doing so, we will train Canadian and Bhutanese youth leaders who are involved in delivering action research projects for community wellbeing, and co-develop an approach to evaluating legacies of these projects in Bhutan. 

The project also aims to use this practical example as a case for the usefulness of the approach in other regions, and to develop a deep, mutual partnership with GPIAtlantic, a global leader in indicators for development. Our community partner will also facilitate the transfer of this learning into an established global network of policy-makers, funders and assessors of genuine progress and wellbeing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Through the project, staff and interns from GPIAtlantic will be trained in the values-based approach to evaluating the legacies of their projects and programmes. They are expected to use these approaches in related projects that they deliver in the Mekong, India and in Canada in following years - the project includes time to specifically ensure this can take place. Key staff and youth from the Bhutanese Youth Development Agency (YDF) will also be trained, and can then cascade this within their youth leaders' network and programmes within Bhutan. 

With over a decade of experience working with the Bhutanese government to develop the Gross National Happiness index, and working with local partners in the delivery of community development programmes, GPIAtlantic has strong connections with Bhutanese government officials, national NGOs and local chapters of international NGOs such as UNICEF, the World Bank and UNDP. GPIAtlantic also have a long-standing collaboration with the Canadian International Development Agency, are well established in the international development community, and are world leaders in developing alternative assessments for community wellbeing and resilience (e.g. they have led the development of the Genuine Progress Index and its application at regional and national levels). Thus, the outcomes of the work delivered through this Follow-on Funding scheme will be widely disseminated within these networks and insights will be shared through face-to-face meetings in Bhutan and Canada in the later stages of the project. Furthermore, we expect that the project will provide a platform of work and real case examples that can be further developed into a rigorous and accessible approach that can bridge local to regional indicators for Genuine Progress - an identified gap that exists worldwide. This work would thus benefit an international community of practitioners and policy-makers engaged in community development and interested in using and further enhancing existing measures of genuine progress (GPI for instance).
GPIAtlantic and YDF will also engage with national Bhutanese media (press, television and radio) who are also expected to benefit from the project. The outcomes from the project, and audio-visual content that we aim to produce will be used as much needed content in media streams, and examples of successful community development projects. 

Partners have carefully considered benefits for all participants and beneficiaries of local communities involved in the project. In particular, Young Volunteers in Action youth from Bhutan and residents in Gothkad, or 'Happiness' villages will benefit from clarifying and communicating the legacies for the community development work carried out in these locations, in doing so strengthening these very legacies. In addition, community members will have more control over the data collected in such evaluation processes, and youth leaders involved in the project will gain new skills in evaluation and values-based approaches which they will be able to apply to a range of project contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79210</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Field work in Thailand</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2165C06F-51E6-4156-8F22-1220751CE21D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The two main partners met over two weeks to i)co-design values based-approaches and experience with development agencies and projects involved in the Gross National Happiness movement ii) introduce leaders in the Thai Volunteer Service and other agencies affiliated with GNH with values-based approach concepts, and thus to explore the legacies of the GNH movement on their own organisations iii) and thus to co-deign with them an approach to use in their local contexts for examining legacies iv) working in two villages to explore locally perceived legacies of GNH movement v)plan two further concrete legacy explorations with local groups in Thailand</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c673f92c06c9.70158336</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have worked hand in hand in this project with our partner, GPIAtlantic, and collaborator, Thailand Volunteer Service (TVS), and their affiliated organisations in Myanmar, India and Bhutan.
