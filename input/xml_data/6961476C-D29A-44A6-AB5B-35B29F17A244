&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>a book-length study on public attitudes towards Scotland?s constitutional future&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a website that will act as a comprehensive and authoritative source of evidence on such attitudes&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>research briefings on key aspects of public opinion.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The book will cover four main topics:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>trends in attitudes since 1999&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>why people support or oppose Scottish independence&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>what policies people would want an independent Scotland to pursue&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how much devolution would Scotland want if it remained within the UK. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>It will assess the lessons that can be drawn from the Scottish case for a number of key academic and policy debates.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The web site will have three main elements, designed to enhance the quality of academic and non-academic reporting of public opinion. It will bring together and make easily accessible all the key survey readings on public opinion published since 2007. It will post blogs on new poll findings shortly after they are published. And it will provide a set of digital links to the existing literature.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research briefings will be four page commentaries on the state of public opinion in respect of a number of key aspects of the debate about Scotland?s constitutional future.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The decision on whether Scotland will leave the UK will eventually be taken by the general public living north of the border. This project will collate, make accessible and analyse the attitudes of that public towards Scotland's constitutional future. In so doing it will help identify what are likely to be the key considerations that eventually persuade people in Scotland to vote either Yes or No, and to ascertain what developments and movements have or have not caused public opinion to change so far. At the same time the project will provide prospective information on public attitudes towards some of the key policy options that would face an independent Scotland and on what pressures and opportunities there might be for carving out a new, more stable constitutional settlement in the event that Scotland votes No. Such information is likely to be regarded as invaluable intelligence by those on all sides of the argument in devising their strategies and policy responses as well as by those organizations whose future could well be significantly affected by the decisions that are eventually taken.

The community of those with a potential interest in the project is thus large and includes:

UK ministers, politicians and campaigners from all parties

Scottish ministers, politicians and campaigners from all parties

Organisers of the Yes Scotland and Better Together referendum campaigns.

UK government civil servants with responsibility for devolution/Scotland

Scottish government civil servants with responsibility for supporting that government's referendum policy

Thank tanks working on devolution policy including Reform Scotland and the Institute for Public Policy Research

Pressure groups with an interest in the future governance of the UK in general and Scotland in particular, including the Electoral Reform Society, the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Scottish Trades Union Council and CBI Scotland.

Businesses located in Scotland, especially those with significant UK-wide operations, including most notably the substantial financial sector based primarily in Edinburgh.

Journalists both north and south of the border, together with journalists from outside the UK

Diplomatic representatives of overseas governments, especially those located in Edinburgh.

Members of the general public with an interest in politics and/or Scotland's future.

The project thus potentially has important implications for both the wealth and the culture of the United Kingdom. In so far as the project informs the campaigning and policy strategies of key participants in the debate, it could materially affect the arguments that are put before the Scottish public and thus perhaps the decision that they eventually take. In so far as the findings inform the decisions made by business about how they should respond to the emerging political environment, and what an independent Scotland might mean, this could affect the future economic wellbeing of Scotland and the rest of the UK. Meanwhile, the culture of the UK will benefit from enhanced media understanding and reporting of the evidence on attitudes towards Scotland's constitutional future, thereby making journalists more effective at advancing public understanding of the referendum debate.

It is anticipated that this impact will begin to arise following the establishment of the proposed website after three to four months and then be advanced further through the provision of research briefings throughout the lifetime of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>267822</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scottish Parliament Festival of Politics</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F4D4A3A8-E463-4926-9641-0261F6EC88B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Post-seminar discussions

It contained three main elements: the inclusion on both the 2013 Scottish Social Attitudes (SSA) survey and the 2013 British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey of a module of survey questions on topics of relevance to the referendum, the creation of a website that provided a comprehensive and searchable collection of survey and polling data on attitudes towards issues in the referendum, together with regular commentaries in the form of 'blogs', and a series (aimed at a non-academic audience) of seminars and briefing papers on public attitudes in the referendum. The survey work was undertaken in tandem with a supplementary award to AqMen (ES/K006460/1) that was also made as part of the initiative, funding that, inter alia, was also subsequently extended to include the inclusion of a further module of questions on the 2014 Scottish Social Attitudes survey. The fellowship also drew on earlier work that had in part at least had been funded by the ESRC, including most notably an award to include a module of survey questions on the 2012 SSA (ES/K006355/1). 

The question of how Scotland should be governed is of course politically contentious. It was not the purpose of this project to generate 'impact' by influencing or changing public opinion on how Scotland should be governed (and thereby perhaps sway the result of the referendum!), let alone change the direction of a public policy on which the UK and Scottish governments had (and still have) very different preferences. Rather it was intended to ensure that impartial information on public attitudes - and what might influence those attitudes - should be available to those within the UK and Scottish governments who were responsible for developing their r institution's policy pronouncements, to those campaigning on all sides of the referendum argument, to journalists reporting on the campaign, and to the interested lay public. In this way the project could help inform public policy (and maybe therefore increase its effectiveness) and enhance the quality of pubic discourse about the referendum (and thus the quality of life).

Each of these target audiences was reached by the project's activities. The seminars organised as part of the fellowship, and held under Chatham House rules, were attended by civil servants from both governments, campaigners from both sides, together with a number of diplomatic representatives of overseas governments. In addition we also gave additional private presentations to key officials in both the UK and Scottish governments, and these presentations were supplemented by innumerable private conversations with officials, campaigners and diplomats. 

In addition, presentations based in whole or in part on the project were also given to a wide variety of non-academic audiences including meetings at or of the British Academy/Royal Society of Edinburgh, political parties (including the Scottish Labour Party Devolution Commission), the Scottish Parliament Festival of Politics, the ESRC (for MPS etc. at Portcullis House), the ESRC Festival of Social Science, Edinburgh International Science Festival, a number of private business organisations in the public relations and financial sectors (including the Board of the Royal Bank of Scotland), the Electoral Commission, the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, and senior officials of the Canadian Government. Prof. Curtice gave many public presentations and lectures, including Stevenson Trust lectures at the University of Glasgow, a Crichton lecture at the university campus in Dumfries, a series of debates (alongside politicians from both sides) organised by the Dundee Courier, and a lecture to the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow. During the course of the year leading up to the referendum, Prof. Curtice gave some kind of presentation about the referendum to a non-academic audience on an almost weekly basis. 

The fellowship also co-sponsored with AqMen two major conferences that reported in January and August 2014 on the latest Scottish Social Attitudes findings. These were attended, inter alia by representatives from the UK and Scottish Government, European Commission, NHS Scotland, British Medical Association, Electoral Reform Society, Yes Scotland, Better, Together, Business for Scotland, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, David Hume Institute, Alzheimer Scotland, U.S. Embassy, Office of Fair Trading, Children in Scotland, Office for Fair Trading, Spanish National Research Council, National Autistic Society, the financial sector, as well as by many interested members of the general public.

The project website, whatscotlandthinks.org was heavily used, and became a widely quoted and cited feature of the referendum campaign. Between its launch in the summer of 2013 and the end of 2014 it received 1,623,327 visits by 921,085 users, resulting in 4,182,840 page views. The site became increasingly popular as the referendum approached. In September 2013, for example, the site had 9,339 users, in March 2014 45,447, and by September 2014 411,551. In other words, during the month of the referendum, approaching half a million people visited the site to look at the data and/or access its commentaries.

The briefings and other written materials generated by the project (including chapters based on the 2013 data that appeared in the 2014 British Social Attitudes report) were the subject of extensive press publicity (and in one instance the subject of a request for information from 10 Downing St.). Material and commentary from the website was cited and quoted widely by traditional media including Scottish media such as BBC Scotland 2014, STV's Scotland Tonight, The Scotsman, and The Herald and UK wide media such as BBC News at 10, BBC Newsnight, The Financial Times, Telegraph, Guardian, Independent and Times. The site was also repeatedly used by international outlets such as CNN International, Bloomberg and CCTV News (China). Prof. Curtice made innumerable personal appearances on Scottish, national and international media (from Columbia to Japan) and wrote widely for print and digital media. The site's role as the central point of information on public attitudes in the referendum is attested, for example, by the fact that it was mentioned 13 times in a House of Lords Library briefing note on polling in the referendum (See http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/LLN-2014-027)

The website and work of the project was supported by a Twitter account that provides further evidence of its reach to non-academic audiences. By polling day
@whatscotsthinks had over 4,500 individual followers, including politicians, campaigners, journalists and businesses as well as members of the general public. 

Here are a few examples of Twitter conversations that referred to the site:

Scottish comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli &amp;quot;http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2014/01/icm-poll-shows-biggest-swing-yet/ this is fascinating....&amp;quot;

Tweets from @whatscotsthink were retweeted by amongst others, the then Deputy First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, and the former Scottish Secretary, Michael Moore MP, as well by many a journalist and politician.

After the referendum, Prof. Curtice made a contribution to a submission to the Smith Commission on more devolution that was organised by the Future of the UK and Scotland initiative. That Commission's report eventually led to the introduction of the Scotland Bill providing for more devolution that is currently going through its final parliamentary stages at Westminster.

The political fallout from the referendum has, of course, been considerable. The reach and value of the site in informing public understanding of these developments was acknowledged by the ESRC in deciding to extend the funding of the site so that it could cover the 2015 UK general election and the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. The continued attention to and use of the site is attested by the fact that its Twitter account now has over 6,600 followers.

It is thus evident that the findings of the project reached a wide range of non-academic audiences. The fact that the key players in the referendum campaign repeatedly attended and asked for further briefings suggests that they found the findings useful, albeit the extent to which they used it in private in developing their campaign strategies is, of course, impossible to tell. The heavy use of the project by the media and the fact that the project engaged directly and indirectly with a wide range of non-academic audiences suggests that it certainly helped to inform the referendum debate, and helped to meet a public appetite for information about a referendum in which there was an unprecedented level of public engagement. In so doing the project can certainly be said to have contributed to the quality of political life, though whether it made any difference to the eventual outcome of the referendum must remain a moot point.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EA83882D-941E-409F-BC9F-7FB2D1C211EF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56aa24c88ff339.66231986</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. The creation of a website that brought together all of the major polling and survey data on attitudes of relevance to Scotland's independence debate, made it available in an easily searchable form, and rendered it accessible via a variety of data visualisation and analysis facilities. In addition the site provided regular impartial commentary (in the form of 'blogs') on new polling data and research findings as they became available, as well as more extended research briefings. The site became (and still remains) the premier site for data and commentary on political attitudes in Scotland and its material was widely cited and used by conventional media. The site was used by over 900,000 unique users between its launch in June 2013 and shortly after the independence referendum in September 2014.
2. Throughout the referendum campaign people's willingness to support independence was heavily contingent on their perceptions of the instrumental, and above all, the economic consequences of independence. Voters who believed the economic consequences were beneficial were inclined to vote Yes, while those who thought they were deleterious voted No. Given that at no stage did a plurality of voters believe that the consequences would be beneficial, it is not surprising that in the event a majority voted No.
People's sense of identity, in contrast, tended to play a secondary role in their voting decision, not least because many people in Scotland feel both Scottish and British. In so far as identity did matter people's attitude towards independence was more closely related to how British they felt than how Scottish they reckoned they were. Many voters appeared to be asking themselves not whether they wanted Scotland to be independent but, rather, whether they wanted to leave the UK.
3. The two year long referendum campaign helped to crystallize public opinion in Scotland. By its end people's views were more closely related both to their evaluations of the economic consequences of independence and to their sense of identity than it had been when the prospect of a referendum first came into view. To that extent at least the referendum campaign seems to have helped Scots cast an informed vote, that is a vote that reflected their perceptions of and attitudes towards the key issues in the referendum debate.
4. So far as pubic opinion is concerned, reaching an agreement on the future relationship between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK should not have been infeasible, while the same is true now that Scotland has opted to remain in the UK. Public opinion south of the border was willing to allow an independent Scotland keep the pound, the BBC and the monarchy and would not have wanted Trident to remain located in Scotland. English public opinion appears to be willing to accommodate Scotland's apparent wish more devolution, the practical implications of which are likely to be constrained by a reluctance amongst Scots to embrace policy divergence a wish to retain access to UK-wide funding.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One of the principal objectives of this fellowship was to ensure that its research findings were communicated widely during its lifetime. The results of the research were regularly communicated during the course of the referendum campaign to civil servants (in both the UK and the Scottish Governments) as well as representatives of both of the main campaign organizations. To that extent, and given the referendum is now over, there is not a lot little left to be 'taken forward'. 
However, the referendum has not settled the debate about how Scotland should be governed. The ballot has bequeathed all-party proposals for more devolution and left an apparent legacy of increased SNP support. On the former, our research uncovered some important inconsistencies in public attitudes towards more devolution in Scotland, of which perhaps rather more note should be taken when the next government addresses how to implement further devolution. On the latter we have kept the public attitudes website going through to the May 7 general election in order to enhance public and journalistic understanding of the phenomenon, and have applied to the ESRC for funding to continue this work through to June 2016.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>724664BA-2B15-4344-BFC3-ED5B0753221A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5526bcb9742ba7.18696224</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://whatscotlandthinks.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited Witness, House of Lords Constitution Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E27BB10D-6B8D-49BB-BB11-45CBAB61B1E5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e071022a3151.27810427</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/constitution-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/the-union-and-devolution/publications/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Rectangular file of all of the data on attitudes collected by the 2013 British Social Attitudes survey.
