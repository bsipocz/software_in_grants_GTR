&lt;p>The research will explore these ideas in relation to three existing nonviolent grassroots networks - neighbourhood watch to prevent suicide bomb attacks in Somalia; projects to record every casualty of armed conflict in many countries in the global South; and projects to stop the street harassment of women in the global North and South.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will examine of how nonviolent grassroots relate to the state, global governance and actors that use and threaten violence. It will also explore these ideas in relation to grassroots security actors which are seeking to network with each other across issue areas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The vision of this project is a flourishing, diversifying and synergistic ecosystem of viral networked action for nonviolent grassroots security with academics and practitioners working together. The project is first step towards identifying practices and establishing follow-on projects that can more fully realise the project?s vision.

Existing security practice generally assumes that non-state actors and hyperconnectivity pose threats (e.g, terrorism), neglecting the ways in which non-state actors increasingly address insecurity positively and non-violently through hyperconnectivity. This project has a high degree of user demand and involvement. We have direct participation from the new democratically-elected Somali government. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud, who has a scholarly and practitioner background in grassroots peacebuilding, has been briefed personally about the project by a research team member and is strongly supportive. We have enthusiastic support from the NGNs we aim to support in counter-terrorism, casualty recording and ending sexual harassment (see Case for Support, Data Collection). 

The research aims to understand how NGNs can transform insecurity through viral and strategic, and specifically knowledge brokered, innovation. That is, this research is directly about understanding and enhancing impact and pathways to it. We aim to transform the work of security practitioners and the outcomes they seek; transform the processes by which they pursue those outcomes; transform the understanding of who is a security practitioner; and transform related subjectivities. This is a radical change from top-down state-centric and militarised security practices; it starts, and looks at the world, from the perspective of bottom-across nonviolent actors and networks. 

Central to this project is conceptualising risk, cost and insecurity in relation to dignity, safety and prosperity. We have been struck by the prominence of dignity in motivating NGN practices, including a willingness to accept risks and costs to safety and prosperity in the pursuit of dignity. Our research directly aims to assist NGN volunteers to optimise their mix of dignity, safety and prosperity on their own terms; to find ways of maximising the extent to which dignity, safety and prosperity can be mutually reinforcing rather than traded off; and to identify counter-productive actions so that harms can be avoided. This research would therefore also be of direct use to third-sector organisations and, in the long run, to the general public. 

Preventing suicide bomb attacks: our research will reinforce and increase the positive outcomes already achieved by the neighbourhood watch approach - fewer suicide bomb attacks, arrests of potential suicide bombers, and locating caches of bomb materials and weapons - without death, injury or trauma among volunteers. We will identify practices that avoid harms, such as attackers switching to more destructive options like large car bombs or displacing attacks to areas without neighbourhood watch. Stopping street harassment: The research will enhance global efforts to reduce street harassment, including identifying successful tactics and enhanced understanding of the nature and extent of direct and indirect risks/costs to volunteers so that those risks/costs can be minimised or avoided. Casualty recording: Our research will study the globalisation of casualty recording and the forms of knowledge brokering among casualty recording groups, which, in addition to providing comfort and dignity to survivors, generate records that can be used as evidence in war crimes tribunals. We aim to develop an approach to knowledge brokering among NGNs with wide-ranging, new and surprising applications, e.g., we are interested in developing ideas such as grassroots networked arms control to provide the end-use and end-user arms trade monitoring that states have neglected or actively avoided.

Somali First is a joint initiative of the University of Bristol and Somali-led company Transparency Solutions (TS). The University of Bristol supports Somali First as a Strategic Priority and has awarded TS the status of Strategic Partner. The Somali First Co-Directors are Prof. Eric Herring of the University of Bristol and Latif Ismail, TS CEO. The other Somali First core team members are Abdihakim Yusuf, Khadir Abdi and Sandra McNeill, all of TS. The core team is supported by its Coordinator Gilberto Algar-Faria, a PhD candidate in the University's School of Sociology, Politics and International Studies (SPAIS). This initiative grew out of the Transforming Insecurity project of the University and TS funded by the Economic and Social Science Research Council (ESRC) grant number ES/L003171/1. Somali First received the University of Bristol Engagement Award 2014/15. We provide research and information resources, build relationships and hold events that bring together Somalis from government, business, civil society, academia and the diaspora with academics and development practitioners. We have a balanced relationship with multiple actors across all regions of Somalia. The FCO welcomes the Somali First initiative, already works closely with us and uses our analysis extensively. Recently we hosted Harriet Mathews OBE, the UK Ambassador to Somalia, who took up her post in June 2015. We have secured the involvement in Somali First of the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC) of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS); the Ministries of Presidential Affairs (MoPA) and National Planning and Development (MoNPD) of the Government of Somaliland (GSL); and the two leading Somali telecoms companies Telesom and Hormuud, which are world pioneers in mobile banking with outstanding Corporate Social Responsibility track records. The other key entities involved are OCVP (the premier social science research organisation in Somalia); the Somaliland Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (SLCCIA); and Act for Somalia (the main British Somali diaspora NGO with strong links to the global Somali diaspora).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5CCD927F-B344-4B57-AC3D-265F12C4B5B5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dc52e918a406.88472145</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The 'Transforming Insecurity through Nonviolent Networks' (Trinsec) project was funded by the ESRC Transformative Call from 1 June 2013 until 30 June 2015 (seven month no cost extension due to illness). The main aim of this research was to analyse whether and how a particular form of civil society - nonviolent grassroots networks (NGNs) - can transform insecurity. The case studies were unarmed neighbourhood watch schemes in Somaliland to prevent terrorist attacks, the global movement to prevent gender-based street harassment and the global citizen casualty recording movement to record the casualties of armed conflict. Particular attention was paid to potential for integrating across issues and through levels of governance beyond specific NGNs. The research combined listening methodology (an open ended giving of space to the expression of the lived experience of an issue) and academic-practitioner co-production of research and impact (i.e. working together at every stage of the process rather than academics doing the research then trying to persuade practitioners to apply its findings). To achieve its main aim, the research delivered on five primary objectives. First, it assessed, integrated and advanced key disciplinary and interdisciplinary theoretical, conceptual and empirical literatures relevant to the overall research question. One of the main findings is that the co-production literature which focuses on identifying a concrete opportunity at the outset misses the value of strong relationships combining with serendipity in generating opportunities. Second, it analysed and compared the role of NGNs: the research found that they have had substantial successes with widely varying structures. Third, it analysed efforts by NGNs at cross-issue and cross-level integration. The research found that this was attempted in all three cases but with limited success. Fourth, the research considered how the bottom-across practices of NGNs can be integrated into bottom-up and top-down practices of transforming insecurity in ways which enhance rather than detract from the positive aspects of NGNs. The main finding here was that it takes sustained strategic effort to make headway: leaving it to viral, distributed digital networks is insufficient. Fifth, and the key payoff sought, the research identified underlying principles and practical mechanisms through which insecurity might be transformed that had the potential for wider application. In essence this involves using listening and co-production methodologies to underpin a practical step-by-step of finding good people, then agreeing on an approach, then building strong relationships and only then thinking about needs, then projects and then funding. The research refined these ideas through the creation of a research and impact initiative called 'Somali First (SF): Promoting Somali-led Development'. SF is the culmination of Trinsec and its main follow-on activity. It integrates Somali government, business, civil society, academia and diaspora to demonstrate what a transformed Somali-led development process might look like. For example, partnering with Somali NGO the Observatory of Conflict and Violence Prevention, SF has secured $698,000 from the international Somalia Stability Fund to train sixty Somali researchers and produce sixty Somali research publications over the next two years.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Trinsec's research-impact linkage takes three related forms (these concepts are outcomes of the research). The first is 'linear impact' of academic research findings then being turned into non-academic impacts. The second is 'embedded impact': the process of academic-practitioner co-production generates two-way impact on practices and understandings. The third is 'critical impact', in which the aim is generate impact not merely within a frame of reference but to change the frame of reference in which understandings and practices are grounded. We are using all three of these pathways to impact in our work with non-academic users as we use the listening, co-production and step-by-step partnership creation methodologies described above under 'Key Findings'. Trinsec's Somali First initiative on promoting Somali-led development exemplifies this approach. Somali-led development builds on local capacities. It is more cost effective, more relevant to local needs and more sustainable than externally-dominated projects that keep Somalis in subordinate positions. SF is innovative in bringing together Somali civil society, government, business and research and diaspora for the first time ever in this way, facilitated by a partnership of the University of Bristol and Somali-led company Transparency Solutions. No other University has this sort of link with Somali entities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3BFE521A-41C6-43D4-952C-A6207748D222</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55fd1f00bbe4c0.59340828</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/global-insecurities/transforming-insecurity/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L003171/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
