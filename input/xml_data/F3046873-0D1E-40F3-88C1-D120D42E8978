1.The first will be a major exhibition on the life and work of the botanist J.D.Hooker and India in the year of his bi-centenary, 2017, at the Indian Museum in Kolkata, India. This exhibition highlights the impact of the network by building on a collaboration between Kew, the BSI, the Indian Museum and CWEH at the University of Sussex. Hooker was the director of Kew (1865-1885) at a time when botany, and the network of botanical gardens, centered on Kew, played a major role in the project of British imperialism. He traveled extensively in India and was the main author of the Flora of British India (1872-97), the only flora of India yet published. The exhibition itself will be based on facsimiles of the exhibition previously developed at Kew, adapted and augmented with collections from the BSI, and other Indian institutions, which hold materials relating to Hooker. 
2. The second exhibition entitled, 'Science and Empire' curated by the BL will produce a facsimile 'pop-up' exhibition, which will be hosted at the NMNH in Delhi. Modelled on the Library's successful touring exhibition, this exhibition will comprise nine attractively-designed panels of facsimile materials drawn from the Library's historic collections of India Office Records, private papers, books and manuscripts in Indian languages, and visual materials. The panels will cover the following themes: forestry; health and disease; irrigation; botany; geology; built environment. Displaying facsimiles of personal diaries and correspondence, government documents, maps, plans, pamphlets, photographs, paintings and drawings, the panels will create a picture of the impact of empire upon the natural and built environment of India over the period 1700 to 1950. The Library's holdings in this area are complemented by collections in India.The British Council will be invited to arrange the practicalities as they have facilitated an earlier exhibition by the BL and has already expressed support for this kind of flexible exhibition. It is expected that the exhibition will tour in Cochin and Mysore.
3. The opening of the Kolkata exhibition will be marked by a public conference with contributions from international speakers working in related disciplines. Both the exhibition and the conference will highlight the importance of India, Indian institutions and people in the development of scientific botany and its centrality to the project of colonialism, while increasing knowledge of, and engagement with India's botanical heritage among Indian academics, school students and the general public. 
4.There will be the involvement of two local schools in a pilot project to engage school children by making them aware of the natural history collecting practices of the British Empire, the co-construction of of botanical knowledge by local communities in India and interesting them in the conservation of endangered flora of South Asia. 
The timing of the event, in Hooker's bi-centennial year will allow the exhibition and conference to both benefit from and contribute to, the significant publicity which will accompany this anniversary in the U.K. This project capitalizes on the work done under the auspices of the previously funded Network for Collaborative Research on the Botanical and Meteorological History of the Indian Ocean, 1600-1900, with the primary aims of disseminating research beyond the academy reversing both the accumulation of the materials of scientific research and narratives of knowledge production from Britain to the global south.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The staging of the Hooker and India exhibition in Kolkata will deepen and expand the exhibition's original impact in the U.K.by presenting it to an entirely new public and academic audience in India, while the production of teaching materials will extend this impact in schools and universities. The extension to audiences within India is seen as of particular value as much of Hooker's most important work and most prolific collecting was done here. The exhibition therefore represents a repatriation of knowledge, helping to highlight the centrality to scholarship of India and Indian collections and also reconnecting disparate archival materials to regenerate debate. The search for related materials at Indian institutions to be undertaken as part of the project will extend knowledge of both Hooker and Indian collections while consultation with universities, and the school project will help build connections and collaborative working relationships between Kew, Sussex, the BSI, the Indian Museum, Indian universities, schools and other institutions. The exhibition will also generate new audiences and users for the Kew/Sussex database of Hooker's Indian correspondence. While the Indian Museum would benefit directly from increased visitor numbers, the international reputations of the Indian Museum, Kew and Sussex would be mutually enhanced by the collaboration. The increased visibility of both Hooker and of Botany would be of strategic value to the partners since it would improve the viability of the collaborative project between CWEH, BSI and Kew. The partners are planning for a future collaborative project to digitise the whole of Hooker's Indian Herbarium, only a sample of which is currently digitised. 

The 'pop up' exhibition planned with the BL at the NMNH, Delhi will highlight the BL's natural history holdings, bringing hidden collections to light and drawing public and scholarly attention to similar collections conserved in India broadening understanding of India's rich natural history heritage and issues related to their interpretation and preservation. 

The school project will bring an understanding of Indian environmental and natural history to a secondary school level audience. The educational materials and essay's produced by the children will be shared on the project website.

The opening public conference will facilitate networking and the exchange of ideas, building on those developed during the funded phase of the original network and in particular the conferences held at Sussex and Delhi in 2012, 2013 and 2014 while presenting the opportunity to engage new international audiences including policy makers. 

The work would also bring into the public domain ideas and issues emerging from substantial and broad ranging under-pinning research generated by the original network both in U.K. and India. This includes the Palgrave book series on global environmental history, the collaboration with the British Library on indigenous sources in the Sundarbans, the British Library's Wellcome Trust funded project on medical topographies, ongoing work with the UK Met Office, the forthcoming publication of a volume on Commonwealth forest history with the Forest Research Institute in Dehra Dun and the proposed digitisation projects at the Forest Research Institute, Indian Museum and the Botanical Survey of India - where the digitisation of 33 volumes of Nathaniel Wallich's files and specimens - are under way. Direct Conversations and meetings will create impact among professionals and policy makers. Such networks and relationships, will in turn help facilitate the proposed next phase of Indian Ocean environmental studies at CWEH: the development of a digital architecture within which an exhaustive archive of sources for the environmental history of the Indian Ocean is brought together and rendered fully searchable and freely accessible from anywhere in the world, revolutionising the study of environmental history.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77040</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Hooker exhibition which was originally curated by Kew for their own exhibition.

The exhibition in Kolkata was opened by Sri Ajay Narayan Jha, the Secretary of MOEFCC. He was given a tour of the exhibitions by Gina Fullerlove and Vinita Damodaran. This was followed by the lighting of the lamp, the welcome song and words of introduction by Paramjit Singh (director of the BSI), Gina Fullerlove, Vinita Damodaran and Ajay Narayan Jha. Finally, a number of books were released by academics involved in the collaboration.
During the tea break, the participants of spoke with Ajay Narayan Jha about various issues. Deepak Kumar stressed the need for digitising the collections of the ZSI (Zoological Survey of India) and the BSI. He spoke about the need to expand the school curriculum to increase the focus on environment and natural history. Ajay Narayan said that he planned four courses of action in response to the exhibition and to a recent meeting with the ZSI. The four courses of action were: 1) building more formalised collaborations between UK, Indian and American governmental ministries dealing with environment; 2) continuing work on digitisation and engaging in discussions about how to speed up this process; 3) involving institutions like NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training), to bring the knowledge to the common people, particularly school children; 4) talking to various institutions about touring the exhibition. All these have since happened the Hooker exhibition has not only attracted a lot of public attention but also two schools have been involved increasing the interest in environmental history and the current environmental global crisis.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bdaa97741152.56761067</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Museum exhibition and school visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A18DC9F2-D93B-4E79-B2A1-B586B54A01F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1st October

The Indian Natural History collections are a product of the documentation project of colonial empires: British, French, Dutch and Portuguese. Through our AHRC network on the botanical and meteorological history of the Indian ocean 1500-1900, CWEH is responsible for identifying relevant historical records on environmental and climate change, strengthening academic and non-academic networks, providing online hosting for descriptive accounts of the collections and providing a roadmap for digitising these sources for improved accessibility. In terms of the botanical record, CWEH has already played a key advisory role in helping holding institutions such as Kew, the Natural History Museum and the British Library to identify important collections such as the Nathaniel Wallich collection, www.nmnh.nic.in/nhmwinh.pdf, to establish interconnections between their various collections and those of institutions in South Asia such as the BSI, Kolkata and the FRI, Dehradun. As a result of our participation in the Endangered Archives project, 33 volumes of Nathaniel Wallich's manuscript files have been rescued at the BSI. Our collaboration with Kew over the Indian letters of Joseph Hooker has resulted in a useful online digital resource which has successfully reached new audiences. www.kew.org/josephhooker. The Indian Letters project with CWEH was part of the Joseph Hooker exhibition at Kew in 2011 http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh/research/josephhooker. The PI was also a participant in a Natural History Museum video documentary as an expert on Indian collections in an NHM exhibition which ran from 2013-2014 http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/art-nature-imaging/collections/india-collection/history-and-context/index.html. The result of these efforts was to highlight the importance of these collections in holding institutions such as the BL, the NHM and Kew which host the biggest collections from India and the Indian Ocean World. The value of these, both in preserving the natural heritage of these countries and in knowledge creation and knowledge repatriation, cannot be underestimated. https://in.news.yahoo.com/indian-flora-records-london-digitally-repatriated-062408802.html.With regard to the climate record, CWEH and PI were part of the negotiations of the World Meteorological Organisation in Maputo in April, 2014 on the climate heritage of the Indian Ocean and worked on the final document. CWEH and its AHRC network are listed in the INDARE (Indian Ocean Data rescue) implementation plan that was signed by several member countries of the Indian Ocean rim at a senior government level on preserving the climate heritage of the Indian Ocean http://www.gfcs-climate.org/node/1. As part of building a climate archive for the region, we are currently in receipt of further funding from McGill University for a project that aims to map the historic climate archive for the Indian Ocean World and to model particular climate events over the last 500 years. The current proposal has emerged in this context and as a result of careful planning meetings held by project partners at Sussex, BL, Kew and the BSI about taking our collaboration forward in the period 2012 to 2016.
Current Activities
Along with Kew and the BL, we have taken two exhibitions to India as part of the larger engagement process with new audiences and to further highlight the importance of natural history collections relating to India held in the U.K. and India. Building on the pathways of impact of the original funded phase of the network including engagement by project team with academics, curators and policy makers in India the current proposal enhances this by engaging with school educators. It uses study days as a model for engaging students in debate and the public conference to bring people together to debate. As a result of the activities of the network, the holding institutions mentioned above have benefited from an understanding of their collections, firstly in terms of which of their collections are of interest to scholars of environmental and climate change and secondly in terms of being aware of one another's holdings and how these may complement each other. We have had four meetings, two in Sussex, one at the BL and one in Delhi to facilitate this. This has led to an important awareness by the FRI, Dehradun, the Indian Museum, and the BSI of the importance of their manuscript collections and the larger possibilities of holding institutions in Britain such as the BL, Kew and NHM for negotiating with holding institutions in India about complementing their collections. The BSI and the Indian Museum are also putting together a conservation programme to preserve their valuable and extensive collections of natural history and showcase them in displays at the Indian Museum. Our proposal is in line with the recent British Council initiative in India encouraging museums and gallery partnerships between India and the U.K. https://www.britishcouncil.in/sites/default/files/re-imagine_museums_india-uk.pdf
 

Exhibition 1: Hooker/ India and the Botanical Heritage of India
 

CWEH and Kew have significant expertise in this area having previously worked together on the digitisation of Hooker's India correspondence, which is now freely available via the Kew website in fully searchable form and has gained wide public and academic usage. Hooker's collections and work are of major importance to Indian botanical heritage, as well as to the environmental and colonial history of the region. These collections also provide a unique insight into changes in climate and biodiversity and are therefore of extreme importance to contemporary debates over anthropogenic climate change, species loss and habitat destruction. His most prolific collecting was done in India. The Hooker centenary exhibition at Kew in 2011 highlighted some of these themes including that of science and empire.
By taking the Kew/Hooker exhibition to Kolkata we have enhanced the impact of the original exhibition by taking it to an Indian audience generating further network and exchange opportunities. By involving the wider Kolkata public in an opening conference, the project has extended the interest in Indian Natural History to new audiences. The participation through a pilot project involving two local schools and by producing teaching materials related to environmental history has had tremendous impact. We also hope to generate new users for the Kew online transcription of Hooker's correspondence at the public, academic and school level. The exhibition is based on facsimiles of what is held in Kew. Part of this project was an inventory of the Hooker letters in the BSI archives by the Indian based Research Assistant Dr Dey which is included as part of the exhibition. The exhibition whilst similar to the exhibition that was in Kew in 2011 has added several new displays curated by the BSI and the Sussex team. It is held at the BSI gallery of the Indian Museum an area of 5000 sq. feet. There has been a long period of detailed discussions with the stakeholders in developing this proposal, including Christopher Mills, former Head of Library, Art and Archives at Kew, James Broughton, Head of International Engagement the NHM, Dr Paramjit Singh, Director of the BSI and Dr Venugopal outgoing head of the Indian Museum and currently Director of the NMNH. There is a shared commitment to and expectation of this project as a means of changing the way that Indian communities experience and value their botanical history. We have generated media interest in the exhibition and have encouraged local groups for example to visit the exhibition and document their experiences.

Exhibition 2: Science and Empire 

The British Library will produce a facsimile 'pop-up' exhibition, 'Science and Empire' was hosted at the Regional Museum of Natural History's gallery in Mysore. Modelled on the Library's successful touring exhibition 'Beyond the Frame: Indian British connections' (2012), the exhibition comprised nine attractively-designed panels of facsimile materials drawn from the Library's historic collections the India Office Records, private papers, books and manuscripts in Indian languages, and visual materials. The panels covered the following themes: forestry; health and disease; irrigation; botany; geology and built environment. Displaying facsimiles of personal diaries and correspondence, government documents, maps, plans, pamphlets, photographs, paintings and drawings, the panels will create a picture of the impact of empire upon the natural and built environment of India over the period of 1700 to 1950 helped depict India's natural heritage.

The Library's holdings in this area were complemented by collections in India and the Regional Museum was invited to display original materials from their collections. The Council facilitated the touring of 'Beyond the Frame' and has already expressed its support for this kind of flexible exhibition, as an effective way of bringing the historical collections of the UK and India to a wider audience. We had extensive media coverage for the inaugural ceremony in Kolkata and Mysore and a series of public lecture by Antonia Moon (BL) and Gina Fullerlove (Kew), Henry Noltie (Edinburgh Botanic garden) Robert Prys Jones (NHM) to enhance public engagement. We also have a twitter and facebook site where the lectures can be downloaded.

Participation of Kolkata schools

The participation of two schools Kolkata as part of the wider engagement exercise with young people. These schools have been chosen because they are government schools with the vernacular, Bengali as the medium of instruction. The students were selected from the first two years of secondary school and will be aged 12-14 when they have less exam pressure. The school days so fare involve taking students out to the Kolkata Botanic Garden for 2 field trips one which will include a visit to the Hooker and the Botanical Heritage of India exhibition and the second to the Kolkata botanic Garden, with a view to exploring the role of both English and native plant collectors, local plant names and India's rich botanical heritage. The impact has been demonstrated by essays written by the students on the environmental history including the built environment of their local area and are being be supplied with reading materials prepared by the local Research Assistant, Dr Anindita Kundu who has prepared handouts for students. They are being supported by reading materials that will contain images and sketches from Hooker's herbarium as well as Bengali chronicles that contain descriptions of the local environment, Ayurvedic medicines and other important narratives on local cultural practices including from the puthi collection. These local chronicles are kept in local museums and contains oral historical material on nature and environment in Bengal. Dr Saha also translates the material into the vernacular. She currently administers the local study days that include the 20 school days for 240 students, in groups of 24 and will lead the group twice a week.

The aim of the study day is to make students aware of the botanical heritage of India as found in the colonial archive and in the local knowledge held in community repositories in West Bengal. As far as learning resources for the participating students and their guides in Kolkata are concerned the educational materials will focus upon addressing the following key questions:
1. Why is botanical knowledge important for our future generation?
2. How does it help us understand our environment?
3. How can we can conserve our environment?
The questions have been framed to suit the goals of the school days and our aim of achieving a wider engagement with the project concerns including an understanding of natural history collecting, the role of botanical knowledge both colonial and indigenous, the importance of India's botanical heritage and its conservation in terms of India's endangered flora and fauna. Another aim of the school days will be to co-produce education materials through an invitation to school children to depict their surrounding environment or a plant in the botanic garden. By studying the local knowledge kept in chronicles (Bengali puthis) the school children will add to their understanding of the contribution of indigenous knowledge in conservation practices in South Asia today. 
After evaluation of the project the team will share its story and educational materials including essays and drawings by school children and digitised pages of the exhibitions key content on the project database on the original CWEH website.

Project Management and Coordination

There has been a long period of detailed discussions with the stakeholders in developing this proposal, including Christopher Mills, former Head of Library, Art and Archives at Kew, current acting Director of Collections, Fiona Ainsworth, Collections Manager, Library, Art and Archives, Kew Dr Paramjit Singh, Director of the BSI and Dr Venugopal outgoing Head of the Indian Museum and currently Director of the NMNH, Antonia Moon and Penny Brook at the BL. We have also consulted James Broughton, Head of International Engagement, NHM and member of our network.

The project is being overseen by the PI, Dr Vinita Damodaran. She will be aided by a Coordinating Committee that will include 5 members of the original network, Professor Alan Lester at Sussex, Prof Deepak Kumar at JNU, two curators, Dr Antonia Moon and Dr Penny Brook at the BL and Prof Paul Basu (SOAS) museum specialist. Vinita Damodaran the PI will coordinate all the activities with help from a part time administrative facilitator at Sussex and a Research Assistant in India, Anindita Kundu. Kundu who is a trained conservator and researcher with PhD in conservation from Kolkata University will organise the study days for the schools and collect the evidence for impact. Dr Debjyoti Das and Dr Paul Basu will be the consultants on the project. Their expertise in endangered archives and local museums will be invaluable in terms of curation and will help ensure targeted impact. The British Council will help with the practicalities in India. The Coordinating Committee will meet thrice during the duration of the project

Outcomes, Impact and Evidence

The staging of the Hooker and India exhibition in Kolkata will deepen and expand the exhibition's original impact in the U.K.by presenting it to an entirely new public and academic audience in India, while the production of teaching materials will extend this impact in schools and universities. The extension to audiences within India is seen as of particular value as much of Hooker's most important work and most prolific collecting was done here. The exhibition therefore represents a repatriation of knowledge, helping to highlight the centrality to scholarship of India and Indian collections and also reconnecting disparate materials to regenerate debate. The search for related materials at Indian institutions to be undertaken as part of the project will extend knowledge of both Hooker and Indian collections while consultation with universities, and the school project will help build connections and collaborative working relationships between Kew, Sussex, The BSI, the Indian Museum, Indian universities, schools and other institutions. The exhibition will also generate new audiences and users for the Kew/Sussex database of Hooker's Indian correspondence. While the Indian Museum would benefit directly from increased visitor numbers, the international reputations of the Indian Museum, Kew and Sussex would be mutually enhanced by the collaboration. The increased visibility of both Hooker and of Botany would be of strategic value to the partners since it would improve the viability of the collaborative project between CWEH, BSI and Kew. The partners are planning for a collaborative project to digitise the whole of Hooker's Indian Herbarium, only a sample of which is currently digitised. The 'pop up' exhibition planned with the BL at the NMNH, Mysore will highlight the BL's natural history holdings, bringing hidden collections to light and drawing public and scholarly attention to similar collections conserved in India broadening understanding of India's rich natural history heritage and issues related to their interpretation and preservation.

Both these exhibitions will enhance the collaboration between Indian and British institutions and will highlight the British Council initiative in India on facilitating Museums and Galleries: UK - India opportunities and partnerships. The school project will bring an understanding of Indian environmental and natural history to a secondary school level audience. The opening public conference will facilitate networking and the exchange of ideas, building on those developed during the funded phase of the original network and in particular the conferences held at Sussex and Delhi in 2012, 2013 and 2014 while presenting the opportunity to engage new international audiences including policy makers. The work would also bring into the public domain ideas and issues emerging from substantial and broad ranging under-pinning research generated by the original network both in U.K. and India. This includes the Palgrave book series on global environmental history, the collaboration with the British Library on indigenous sources in the Sundarbans, the British Library's Welcome Trust funded project on medical topographies, ongoing work with the UK Met Office, the forthcoming publication of a volume on Commonwealth forest history with the Forest Research Institute in Dehra Dun. Direct Conversations and meetings will create impact among professionals and policy makers. Such networks and relationships, will in turn help facilitate the proposed next phase of Indian Ocean environmental studies at CWEH: the development of a digital architecture within which an exhaustive archive of sources for the environmental history of the Indian Ocean is brought together and rendered fully searchable and freely accessible from anywhere in the world, revolutionising the study of environmental history. Documenting this project and measuring its impact is part of the production of knowledge central to the vision of the proposal.

The objectives of this current project will be specific, measurable and time bound. It will target specific groups, such as school children. The project team will be cohesive and clear about project aims and goals and how to measure impact and collect evidence. In order to determine how the experience of seeing either the exhibition or otherwise engaging with this project's activities change people's perceptions various tools and methods will be employed.

1. Visitor numbers will be collected.

2. Visitor's experience, surveys and interviews will be done to provide evidence that minds have changed and new understandings reached by individuals.

3. With regard to Schools we will measure change in 240 students by making them complete a questionnaire before they go on their visits and then afterwards.

4. There will be interviews with teachers in the two schools feeding back their experience of change.

5. With regard to universities in Kolkata and Delhi evidence of links with university academics teaching Environmental history will be demonstrated.

6. Overall evidence about the way in which these events/activities have altered public understanding of India's resources, histories and policies.

The interviews will be (a) Face to face (b) Telephonic (c) self-completion on paper or electronically.

Other ways of measuring impact include;

1. A visitor's book as a way of capturing the thoughts of visitors and getting feedback.

2. Record keeping or self-observation by PI and Dr Kundu. This is a useful resource on how we can do things better in future.

3. Media Impact in terms of sales and readership figures of any publication.

4. Other general information on visitor numbers to the museums, visitor breakdown with regard to children and family visits will be provided.
 

It is planned that the long term legacies of the project in terms of changes to behaviour will be mapped a year after the end of the project through oral and written interviews with students, academics and members of the general public and U.K. partners (BL and Kew) and Indian partners (BSI and NMNH).

It has already demonstrated impact of reach and significance in its ability to highlight new sources to understand environmental and climate change and to reach wider audiences through museum displays and online digital resources. Initial funding from the Sussex Research Opportunities Fund and the AHRC has led to collaborative work between the Centre for World Environmental History (CWEH) at Sussex with a range of non-academic institutions such as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, (Kew) the British Library (BL), the U.K. Met Office, the World Meteorological Organisation and Indian institutions such as the Botanical Survey of India (BSI), the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun (FRI) the Indian Museum and the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). It has resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding between the University of Sussex, the British Library and the U.K. Met Office, whereby these institutions agreed to share historical weather and climate data. The network currently has 105 members and has held three successful meetings in the U.K. and in India. We also host a descriptive account of the collections relating to natural history of the Indian Ocean World on the CWEH website http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh/research/indianocean. This current award takes some of these aims and objectives further.

Aims and Objectives
Some of the key network members build on knowledge exchange and pathways to impact already undertaken in the funded phase of the original network and have identified a well-defined need for the fruits of their collaboration to be taken to new audiences in India by highlighting the value of historic natural history collections held in the U.K. and India for preserving India's botanical heritage. This is being done through two museum displays, a public conference, a workshop and a school project.

? Museum display (adapted by Kew from an earlier exhibition) on Hooker, India and the botanical heritage of India in the BSI gallery of the Indian Museum in Kolkata 
? Museum display organised by the BL on Science and Empire in NMNH in Mysore
? an opening public conference in Kolkata with academic and non-academic audiences 
? A pilot project to engage two Kolkata schools in understanding the links between Botany, Empire and the historic environment. 
The exhibitions represent for the first time a repatriation of botanical knowledge, highlighting the importance of India and Indian botanical collections held both in Britain and India and connects disparate materials through a search of related materials at Indian Institutions. We also plan to deliver impact by changing the culture of holding institutions such as the BSI with regard to the conservation of their natural history holdings and underlining their importance to the wider Kolkata and Delhi public and increasing visitor numbers to the BSI gallery and the NMNH.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The exhibition which has been loaned permanently by us to the BSI is currently the focus of several activities, increasing the number of visitors and involving schools. It is hoped that will improve the public engagement with the natural history collections held in Indian institutions and improve the interface between scientists and the public in these institutions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>05769DF3-29DB-4F1B-82D4-3D2288311DEB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c820c0262411.17103113</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh/research/indianocean</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influencing policy of Botanical Survey of India and the National Museum of Natural History on their collections</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C19409C5-C700-4A8C-A5F5-0E759CBF84AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition in Kolkata on Hooker and the environmental heritage of India was opened by Sri Ajay Narayan Jha, the Secretary of Ministry of Climate change, environment and forests. He was given a tour of the exhibitions by Gina Fullerlove (Kew) and Vinita Damodaran (Sussex). . Ajay Narayan said that he planned four courses of action in response to the exhibition and to a recent meeting with the ZSI. The four courses of action were: 1) building more formalised collaborations between UK, Indian and American governmental ministries dealing with environment; 2) continuing work on digitisation and engaging in discussions about how to speed up this process; 3) involving institutions like NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training), to bring the knowledge to the common people, particularly school children; 4) talking to various institutions about touring the exhibition. This impact at a high level. We hope to meet with him further to push these policy imperatives. We also have an ongoing school project with impact on the education of vernacular school children who are appreciating going to the Kolkata Botanic garden and learning about environmental sustainability.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bdb3f37e4886.03665270</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh/research/indianocean</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The network allowed for a scoping of the archives and collections relating to botany and meteorology in various locations in the Indian Ocean world.
