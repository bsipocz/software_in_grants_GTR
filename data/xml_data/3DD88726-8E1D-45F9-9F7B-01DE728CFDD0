A low carbon economy needs all businesses to improve their use of energy and to reduce waste. Everyone working in the hospitality industry has an impact on energy usage and waste. This Knowledge Exchange project will help to ensure that research based knowledge does more to support improved use of energy and reduced waste in the pub sector. It will do this by bringing together the complementary expertise of a private company - Robinsons Brewery - and the research team at the Centre for Enterprise at Manchester Metropolitan University Business School.

UK Pubs produce an estimated 873,800 tonnes of waste each year of which 173,000 tonnes is food waste. This waste costs the sector &amp;pound;357 million per annum. Energy used in catering accounts for between 4 and 6 per cent of operating profits. There is evidence that most hospitality businesses in the UK could reduce their energy consumption by 10-40 per cent. Reducing environmental impact may incur costs but also present opportunities for cost saving as well enhancing reputation in terms of environmental credentials. The project will update and develop our research with SMEs about environmental innovation and make it more specifically applicable to public houses. Mindful of the nature of pub tenancies, we will do this through the lens of a body of research in which Baines conceptualised the 'familial economic unit' of the micro-business as mediating economic action and beliefs. 
The 10 month project is designed around four sequential but interdependent phases, followed by intensive engagement and impact generation, The phases are: 
1. Inception, awareness raising, refinement of the project plan and impact generating strategy, and establishing an expert Impact Advisory Group 
2. A focussed evidence review and the adaptation of a diagnostic tool - previously developed and used by the Centre for Enterprise in its wok with small businesses - to provide an environmental dimension to the diagnosis 
3. An on line consultative survey of Robinsons tenants (target 325) to ascertain levels of 'environmental literacy' and one-to- one consultation with purposively selected tenants receptive to the project objectives and willing to experiment and take on an active 'trail-blazer/ champion' role.
4. Developing a Community of Practice (CoP) for the exchange of learning and to foster a supportive network of practitioners. We will support the CoP through facilitated meetings in the form of 'lean green knowledge cafes' and social media.
5. This phase involves a range of activity to ensure maximum impact form the project. Details will be planned at the outset and refined as the project unfolds with significant input from the Impact Advisory Group. We will include a final roadshow for Robinson's staff and tenants, and a national launch event targeted to selected groups with the interest and capacity to implement change. 

The project will create
A dedicated web-site containing a compendium of information and materials in attractive formats including an animated film
A set of accessible learning resources and diagnostics grounded in industry specific experience to support pub tenants and their staff with reduced waste, decreased consumption of energy, and cost saving.
A high profile launch event to showcase achievements and lessons learned. This will be carefully targeted to groups and individuals with the interest and capacity to make a difference.
An ongoing Community of Practice with a common interest in environmental responsibility in the pub sector: We believe this will be a particularly valuable legacy of the project as participants in its activities will become aware of the power of peer-to-peer learning and the very significant business benefits that it generates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ideas that underpin this proposal, and our approach to knowledge exchange and impact, are informed by our long-standing engagement with businesses concerned with both commercial success and environmental sustainability. The specific focus and activites proposed have been developed over a series of meetings between the university-based applicatants and the private sector partner Robinsons Brewery.

Who will benefit
Primary non-academic beneficiaries of the project will be Robinsons Ltd, their public house tenants (who are small businesses in their own right) and their staff, families and customers. William Robinson will draw upon his networks in the industry to ensure learning from the knowledge exchange is widely shared. As part of the first stage of the project in month 1, the partners will together develop an Impact Action Plan to share ideas with stakeholders (defined as individuals and groups with an interest in, or affected by the project) within the industry regionally and nationally, as well as policy makers and policy advisors cencerned with carbon reduction more generally. This plan will identify the best routes to communicate new ideas. Based on the knowldge and networks of team memebers in the university and Robinsons, we have produced a preliminary, indicative list of groups most likely most to benefit. These include: 
The British Institute of Inn-keeping 
The Council for Hospitality Management Education
Pub is the Hub (PiTH)
The BBPA Property Panel
The All Party Parliamentary Beer Group
The Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP)
ENWORKS
If the project is funded this list will be extended and refined with the support of an Impact Advisory Group chaired by Centre for Enterprise Deputy Director Dr Clare Scofield. This will ensure that the project reaches groups and individuals with the greatest capacity and interest to make a difference. In the longer term there is potential to benefit all communities and businesses affected by the activities of Public Houses.

How will they benefit?
The most direct, short term benefits will be within the commercial private sector. Pub tenanats will become more competitive through saving energy and cutting waste in ways that can be made to work in the contexts of their business and household constraints. They will be faciltated to support and encourage eachother. The project will also help build the capacity of Robinsons to be at the forefront of sustainable trading. By making a contribution to carbon reduction, it will ultimately benefit residents and communities across the region and the country. It will also help local and national government to meet carbon reduction targets. 

Capacity building and skills
Collaboration between Robinsons and two university departments (the business school and the department of Food and Tourism Managment) will be key to the project's success in ensuring that outputs are as practice-relevant as possible. Two-way placements (business to university and university to business) will build the capacity of the business partner to access and utilise research evidence, and the capacity of the university-based team to bring diverse forms of knowledge to bear on the research process. This in turn will enable them to advance academic practice and theory with regard to knowledge exchange and impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48877</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk to the  Pub Industry Energy Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1063F0B3-F26E-4370-8BA0-CFA965CEC655</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The &amp;quot;Pub Industry Energy Symposium&amp;quot; was organised by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) in response to changes in energy taxation.

There is evidence of behaviour change, reduced waste and increased profits. Tenant licensees Mark Gibson of the Bleeding Wolf, Scholar Green in Cheshire and Ian Booth at the Swan Inn, Wybunbury in Cheshire were &amp;quot;trailblazers&amp;quot; who took part in the waste separation exercise. During a four week period kitchen waste was separated using clear plastic buckets labelled 'spoilage', 'prep' and 'plate waste'. Weights were recorded on a waste sheet in the kitchen and the figures entered into the food waste calculator created for the project. The calculator works out the annualised cost of waste food as well as the difference between the first and fourth weeks of measurement. Mark Gibson said that &amp;quot;generally just being involved made us think more - it opens your eyes to how much can be wasted.&amp;quot; Ian Booth reported that as part of a redesign of the pub's food business, a focus on waste helped increase gross profit on food from 63% to 76%. 

Robinsons managed pub The Airport (near Manchester Airport) also took part in this exercise. The menu had recently been redesigned and food waste wasn't an obvious problem but between weeks one and four total waste was down by 16% saving an estimated annual &amp;pound;2,946 in food purchase costs plus &amp;pound;1,000 from cutlery rescued from the bins. One practical change was coleslaw and sauces. They are now offered to customers rather than served automatically. As a result, instead of using eight tubs of coleslaw a day, the pub now uses just one. The general manager commented, &amp;quot;I would say to any publican thinking of doing this that it is definitely worth it whether you're a large food-led pub or a small one. This trial really helps you identify areas that can improve your business. It really opened my eyes&amp;quot;.

Robinsons Food Development Manager Nick Burns has taken ownership of the calculator tool and uses it in the training of new tenants and support for existing ones. This is described under 'reducing food waste in public houses' (impact on policy and practice). Talking about the food waste measurement process and tool, he told us, &amp;quot;it's really clever - it just always works and the [recently] revised version of the spreadsheet is perfect. It's much more user friendly&amp;quot;. 

Engagement with the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) and Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) indicates strong potential for impact in the industry beyond Robinsons estate. We gave a well received presentation about the project to BBPA symposium on energy in London in May 2016 (described under engagement activities). BBPA is part of a working group organised by WRAP to address environmental concerns in the hospitality sector. An output of this working group is a 'week of action' followed by a campaign around monitoring and measuring. We have worked with BBPA and WRAP on a selection of Robinsons pubs as case studies to inspire others. This is likely to evolve over a longer timeframe and updates will be made when appropriate.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EECECBE2-05A7-4DCA-8F91-4FDBAAE53E21</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d4868ebae134.52503981</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This Knowledge Exchange project developed practical tools for publicans to help them achieve greener retailing. These are:

A guide on Greener Retailing for pubs with sections on Food and Drink, Energy, Water, Trade Waste and Changing Staff Behaviour. The guide was informed by a review of general good practice then adapted for the pub sector. Content was tested and augmented through engagement with trail-blazer pubs. 

A Food Waste Calculator to support food waste measurement and reduction measures included in the guide. The Calculator draws together data and processes from industry and existing research 

A Greener Retailing award for Robinsons pubs forms part of the project legacy. 


This project was an effective university - business partnership with close engagement between the award holders and Robinsons core business team. The project steering group was led by Robinsons Managing Director (pubs division) and included the Operations Manager and two Business Development Managers (area managers) for the pub estate who brokered relationships between the KE team and eight trail-blazer pubs. Engagement with other relevant staff took place through a series of meetings culminating in a workshop at the Brewery in July 2015. These interactions developed the Greener Retailing brand and helped to embed Greener Retailing principles and practice across the core business. 

Our intervention through action research showed that behaviour change could be surprisingly rapid when the sheer amount of waste and its cost to the business (and the publican's income) were rendered visible by a simple mechanism such as of sorting and weighing food thrown away. 

 Some of the literature proposes education and training as the means of changing behaviour but our results emphasise the value and importance of peer learning in promoting pro-environmental retailing practices.

The project made a contribution to knowledge on eco-innovation and sustainable business practice: A review of relevant literature identified a gap in relation to the pub sector and suggests that adoption of pro-environmental change in small and micro businesses more generally remains under-researched. The experience of the Robinsons tenants and the brewery underline the intertwined ethical and business motivations behind adoption of pro-environmental practices, and how split incentives affect 'green' behaviours. The complexity of the brewery and tenant licensee relationship renders widely used 'stage' models of change overly linear.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The KE objectives have been met with substantial impacts at the local level and already apparent for both Robinsons tenant licensees and the core brewery business. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) provides a route for wider industry dissemination, already initiated through presentation of findings and tools at a BBPA conference on driving energy efficiency in the pub sector (London, 5th May, 2016).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E84A1BB2-BF23-424C-9EB4-2AB7FB641106</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d486268ba295.47692986</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.mmucfe.co.uk/what-we-do/research/making-pub-retailing-greener-a-university-private-sector-partnership-to-bui</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Waste reduction in public houses</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9BB2D98C-405B-434B-95B3-2AFFA21CFA97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Guide on Greener Retailing for pubs and the waste calculator are used within Robinsons and have resulted in practice changes in the brewery and pubs. They have been adopted into training by Robinsons Food Development Manager Nick Burns in a session he runs as part of the brewery's induction course for new/prospective tenants and their staff. He also uses it in one- to-one sessions with current tenants on menu design and kitchen organisation, and he reports that the tool and process help him with this. One notable success is a county pub with a very traditional menu. Although initially sceptical, the tenant agreed to try separating and measuring food waste, as in the trailblazer pubs during the project. During the first week of measuring the pub was throwing away as much as 21.50 kilos of food per day. Between week one and week four, total waste reduced by 33% with an estimated annual saving of &amp;pound;3,062 on food purchase. Gross profit is up by an estimated 5-6% and the tenant estimates that around 2.5% of this can be attributed to better controlling waste through monitoring. This pub is one of the case studies to be used in the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) week of action to raise awareness around monitoring and measuring food waste.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b58664abc290.99798235</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B0B9C94F-4C22-424C-86BB-D023A38E2783</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards environmental and economic sustainability in the public house hospitality sector</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4d448f0eee80bffa009797a61b20d3b2"><gtr:id>4d448f0eee80bffa009797a61b20d3b2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McNeill, T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5649d4d1df33c7.01310544</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5C6310DF-EB5C-4779-AFB6-89FE98A53BC6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Making Pub Retailing Greener: First steps towards pro-environmental change</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/82e285d60ec59a6699aa15a87033321e"><gtr:id>82e285d60ec59a6699aa15a87033321e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baines, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b493c5aaa392.20776812</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M006255/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2F0BA056-5E00-4769-9080-8085A23EC6F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Entrepreneurship</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B84A7490-2819-45EF-95A2-AD7818035D5C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hosp, Leisure &amp; tourism manage</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D6F08770-CB96-423D-89E7-3F64DE17997E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Innovation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
