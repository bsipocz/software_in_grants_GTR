Ten are EMBRAPA employees located at Trigo, Passo Fundo (5), agricultural informatics, Campinas (1), soybean, Londrina (1) and Cenargen, Brasilia (3). The two additional Brazilian scientists are University based (Vicosa and Maringa). The UK scientists are located at Rothamsted Research (RRes) in the department of Plant Biology and Crop Science (9) and Applied Bioinformatics (1).

The assembled team has highly complementary skills, which are required to deliver the initial project objectives and to develop the joint studies required to deliver the full project. The skills needed to deliver on the six work packages (WPs) proposed are as follows:

WP1: Phytopathology and modelling, specialising in Fusarium head blight (FHB)-wheat (Fernandes, Del Ponte and Tessmann), epidemiology, diagnostics and air dispersal of various pathogens including wheat infecting Fusaria (West).

WP2: Plant, animal and fungal bioinformatics and protein modelling (Martins and Togawa), plant and pathogen genomics (King and Hammond-Kosack).

WP3: T-DNA design, stable plant transformation, analysis of transformants (Huttly, Lee and Jones), transient wheat transformation (Lau), transgenic plant analyses (Bonato). Designing/conducting GM wheat field trials in Brazil (Nepomuceno) and UK (Jones). 

WP4: Functional genomics/genetics and plant biotechnology, including Host induced gene silencing (HIGS) and si-RNA of Fusarium graminearum (Fg) in tobacco (Arag&amp;atilde;o), wheat and Arabidopsis (Kanyuka, Hammond-Kosack). Fungal molecular genetics and Fg transformation (Urban).

WP5: FHB disease assessments in controlled environment and/ or the field (Lima, Urban, Brown, Machado), mycotoxin quantification (Tibola and Urban), near-infrared reflectance analysis of wheat grain quality (Tibola), digital imaging processing (Barbedo). 

WP6: Grant proposal and report writing - all, either as a team or as an individual.

This project reuires the use of specific resources. These include the already well characterised cereal infecting fusarium isolate collections obtained from previous wheat crops grown Rio Grande and Parana States in South Brazil. The working prototype FHB-wheat prediction model developed for South Brazil. Advanced bioinformatics pipelines established at RRes for Fg genome assembly and annotation, and at Brasilia for elimination of non-target organism effects. The highly efficient wheat transformation facility only available at RRes. The protected GM field trial site at RRes and equivalent GM trial sites in South Brazil. The licensed containment growth room facilities in place at Cenargen and RRes for exploring HIGS and si-RNA mechanisms using various transgenic plant species in combination with transgenic Fusarium reporter strains. Finally, the unique near infrared resonance analysis facility for grain analysis is only available in Passo Fundo.

The four EMBRAPA institutes, two Brazilian Universities and RRes each have well developed scientific infrastructures in place to expedite the experimentation proposed, the data capture, analyses and storage required and the regular communication needed by Skype, e-mail and by using secure data exchange sites.

The proposed project will be closely aligned with activities under the new UK-Brazil partnership for Yield Stability and Protection in a Changing Climate (PYSP). PYSP is part-funded by a Newton-fund joint centre award and is jointly coordinated by RRes and EMBRAPA. This project will be integrated within PYSP activities, ensuring there is adequate coordination of exchange activities with minimal duplication and maximum engagement between different groups from EMBRAPA and research groups at RRes. PYSP will provide a central focus for all RRes/ EMBRAPA activities, thereby strengthening links across projects and ensuring greater impact for all joint research undertaken.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>N/A</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary purpose of this project is to address issues relating to food/ feed security and food/ feed safety in developing countries, such as Brazil, Africa, China, and elsewhere in the world, caused by a high profile plant disease that leads to the contamination of harvested cereal grains with harmful fungal toxins (mycotoxins). The project will partner the longest running agricultural research organisation in the UK, and the largest agricultural science organisation in Brazil, providing access to an enormous range of expertise and resources. By bringing together these internationally excellent scientific groups, we will create a new collaborative potential for research that is further strengthened by the coordination efforts of the UK-Brazil Newton funded PYSP initiative (jointly managed by RRes and EMBRAPA). This level of synergy is necessary if the complex challenges facing agriculture in Brazil are to be met and the translation of solutions to be effective.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68188</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A collection of postcard highlighting the importance of Fusarium and the research on-going at Rothamsted were prepared for the Fusarium one-day event held at Rothamsted in July 2016.

Draft genomes for the four other wheat infecting Fusarium species prevalent in Southern Brazilian wheat crops have been obtained. Gene annotation has commenced but is not yet completed. 

Transgenic wheat plants expressing two different host-induced gene silencing constructs (HIGS) have been generated. Sufficient seed is available from the T2 generation for the initial plant inoculation experiments to be done controlled environmental conditions.

Fungal spores have been detected above field crops in Brazil by sampling the air using a drone (UAVs)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To develop a novel way to control Fusarium Head blight (FHB) disease in wheat fields in Southern Brazil</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ADB83787-D1C7-4CF1-AEA6-D67564C2B244</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d976972986f0.33120431</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>94E5625E-84A6-4D06-9DDD-BCA888F126C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structure-based virtual screening of hypothetical inhibitors of the enzyme longiborneol synthase-a potential target to reduce Fusarium head blight disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of molecular modeling</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dbf8b2eab4dbdc2d326c2a3168d9c534"><gtr:id>dbf8b2eab4dbdc2d326c2a3168d9c534</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bresso E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0948-5023</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58a59d19b5d1a1.17676316</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D82DBA08-A7A2-455F-981F-F99965422097</gtr:id><gtr:title>RNAi as an emerging approach to control Fusarium head blight disease and mycotoxin contamination in cereals.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Pest management science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a4e706972707e85dad71cc59b74a884d"><gtr:id>a4e706972707e85dad71cc59b74a884d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Machado AK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1526-498X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7094eea99977.72324739</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>125E4439-A240-47D7-98A8-B964C95F6CD3</gtr:id><gtr:title>GPCRs from fusarium graminearum detection, modeling and virtual screening - the search for new routes to control head blight disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC bioinformatics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dbf8b2eab4dbdc2d326c2a3168d9c534"><gtr:id>dbf8b2eab4dbdc2d326c2a3168d9c534</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bresso E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2105</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58a59ddc9d9119.08275907</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8C587F6F-C88F-4892-9709-2D418BF366F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Annotation of Fusarium graminearum (PH-1) Version 5.0.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Genome announcements</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e0d3cf730dd45838345aed36a7c7886c"><gtr:id>e0d3cf730dd45838345aed36a7c7886c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>King R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a59f36b706d8.62527536</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N004493/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C5107770-461D-42E3-B991-48AE97DF206F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FEBB49F4-3228-4CBC-98AB-99A078FB98B5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Functional genomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4661C82D-F66E-4672-BA82-7C12180BBDF7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
