However, such driver-vehicle collaboration during automated driving will impact on the driver's attention and cognition and it is important to consider these effects in order to prevent any negative impact on driving. This project aims to achieve a safe engagement and smooth and swift control-authority shift between the driver and the vehicle controller during adaptive automated driving. To this aim, we will first conduct a comprehensive study of driver attention and cognitive control characteristics when interacting with the vehicle controller. An optimal control authority shifting system which considers driver cognition will then be systematically developed and validated. This cross-disciplinary research challenge will be addressed using a unique combination of researchers from engineering, cognitive neuroscience and human factors. The research will not only contribute to the cutting-edge technology innovations in automated driving, but will also result in a major advance in the science of human attention and cognitive control when interacting with automation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research aims to make a major scientific advance in human attention and cognitive control when interacting with automation, and cutting-edge technology innovations in automated driving, using a unique combination of internationally known experts from engineering, cognitive neuroscience and human factors. The research along with its outputs will benefit a wide range of groups, including:

- Academic researchers worldwide in disciplines such as engineering, cognitive neuroscience, psychology and human factors. These will not only benefit from the research itself, but also gain insights from such a unique combination of cross-disciplinary expertise to tackle complex research challenges that are beyond a single discipline.

- All stakeholders related to the automotive sector will significantly benefit from this research by taking advantage of its research methodology and framework, as well as the outcomes and technological innovations. This will contribute to the emerging development of automated cars, in particular future-generations of JLR's intelligent and automated cars.

- Government and policy-makers will benefit from this research, when developing regulations, recommendations, and training related to safe automated cars and driving. 

The research outcomes will also contribute to the enhancement of driving safety by generating a smooth control-authority shifting collaboration between the driver and the vehicle controller. The research will further help to promote public awareness of automated cars and their benefits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1587193</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Within the scope of the project activities, a few preliminary achievements have been obtained so far, which are concisely summarised below. 

i). An online survey on what types of non-driving tasks (NDT) a human driver is likely to be performing when travelling in a Level 3 automated vehicle has been conducted and documented in an internal report. Four activities were identified as the most important NDTs during a 60-minute journey in such a case, namely internet browsing, reading, news and emailing. Based on these findings, experiments have been designed and are being carried out to understand human driver attentional load in internet picture browsing during the autonomous driving mode. The experiments collected diverse images representative of internet browsing, obtained reliable crowd sourced ratings of visual attentional load, and helped to construct and fit a computational model using Convolutional Neural Network to predict such attentional demand. Comparisons against two prominent salience models, MLnet and SalGAN, indicated the novelty of the proposed work. 

ii). For the purpose of measuring and monitoring task load using EEG in the next step, preliminary research was conducted. Behavioural work established a data set of meaningful scene images that been ranked on their level of visual complexity. This data set will be serve as a basis for the future study.

iii). A preliminary prototype system for online driver NDT detection was proposed. The prototype focused on measuring driver head motions while travelling in a car. This system was designed in a hybrid fashion with the integration of one camera and two motion sensors. Preliminary experimental tests showed that the fusion of two measurements was found to improve the reliability of head tracking accuracy. The experimental results also indicated that different NDTs led to different head movement patterns, which can be applied as an important feature to determine the type of NDTs. This preliminary research demonstrates the potential of using such a system as a basis for the development of an online NDT and driver attention detection system. 

iv). To understand driver's take-over behaviours so as to prepare for the design of CogShift take-over system, analysis of Autopilot disengagements (DE) occurred during automated vehicle testing was performed by reviewing seven public DE reports. Reasons of DEs were reviewed such as hardware issues, software failures, weather conditions, road surface conditions, emergencies and precautionary intervention, among which the software issues and limitations were the most common. From this research, take-over mechanisms have also been preliminarily investigated and it has been found that the average take-over time was less than one second. Based on the results, recommendations were provided to auto OEMs and governmental organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key findings might benefit and be taken forward by researchers in cognitive neuroscience, automotive engineering, information and communications technology, and human factors. The online survey results (a paper planned to be submitted) would provide a starting point for researchers to understand human activities when interacting with automated driving. The novel way of computationally modelling visual attentional load relating to image complexity together with the preliminary results for EEG markers would offer a base for the study of cognitive load engaging in a visual-related non-driving task. The prototype online detection system and relate findings (a paper planned to be submitted) would provide a valuable tool in developing driver state monitoring systems based on head motions. The review of disengagement activities during automated driving and findings (a journal paper under review) would not only benefit researchers who develop automated vehicle technologies, but also have potential commercial impact and would provide valuable information for automotive R&amp;amp;D and also policy makers. The postdoctoral researchers and PhD students within the project have been steadily developing research as well as transferable skills, which will benefit their career life.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>87B0C3DE-7363-4824-ACF5-07FC76933AB7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd8df3eb0a16.84059470</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F11F9EB4-0BD7-40E5-A44A-9DD7B0D4C9D5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Characterization of Driver Neuromuscular Dynamics for Human-Automation Collaboration Design of Automated Vehicles</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e28b92a9adbe287d78dea699f22b5c7a"><gtr:id>e28b92a9adbe287d78dea699f22b5c7a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lv C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>10834435</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa96f154bf416.75402378</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5A3860AD-1E86-4F0C-8014-2CA014CD090D</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Orientation Sensor-Based Head Tracking System for Driver Behaviour Monitoring.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/673680106ade3187f249d2a683028495"><gtr:id>673680106ade3187f249d2a683028495</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhao Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1424-8220</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a995ad59eb7f9.64963485</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6830D87-A8E3-4EF8-9689-47F98D4FF024</gtr:id><gtr:title>Analysis of autopilot disengagements occurring during autonomous vehicle testing</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e28b92a9adbe287d78dea699f22b5c7a"><gtr:id>e28b92a9adbe287d78dea699f22b5c7a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lv C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>23299274 23299266</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa96bf21b8ea0.50830465</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N012089/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
