The most obvious, macroscopic example is a human being walking by activating skeletal muscles. Muscle movement is based on the interaction of specialised protein molecules (motor proteins) found in muscle cells. However, apart from muscle movement, there are also many other forms of organised movement within each cell of the human body. For example proteins, which are produced in one part of the cell, have to be transported to a different part where they are required to fulfil a certain function. This organised traffic within cells is based on a highly specific interaction of proteins and other molecules. Interruption of these transport processes will lead to malfunction of the cell and disease. By studying the interaction of motor proteins in isolation we aim to understand the basic mechanisms of normal function and disease. We apply a large variety of modern biochemical and biophysical techniques including state-of- the- art studies at the level of single molecules. The two main research themes are cell motility and cell signalling. We aim to understand the mechanism of muscle contraction in normal and diseased heart, how particles are transported in the cell, how DNA is transcribed and repaired but also how molecules involved in cell signalling work and how pathways and processes can be repaired if they fail. Our work is highly collaborative with other NIMR divisions because we believe this to be the most efficient way to obtain detailed molecular information towards an understanding of human health and disease on the cellular level.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The goal of our research team is to use single molecule techniques to study the basic mechanism of force production by motor proteins and the way in which these molecules are regulated and adjusted to highly specific tasks in the living cell. Currently, our work focuses on the family of myosin motors, on which many types of cellular motility are based. There are now known to be at least 18 different classes of myosin, involved in a large variety of functions such as membrane trafficking, endocytosis, cell division, signal transduction and sensory transduction. Most mammalian cells express at least 11 different myosin isoforms. Mutations in myosin are associated with a large number of inherited diseases, such as familiar hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, various forms of deafness, neurological and immunological disorders. Myosins might also be involved in processes associated with parasite infections, such as red blood invasion by the Malaria parasite. We are studying a variety of myosins (class I, II, V, VI, IX and X), trying to understand how these motor molecules are regulated and fine tuned to their specific role in the living cell. We have collaborations with groups across Divisions at NIMR (T Holder, Parasitology; W Taylor Mathematical Biology and F Fraternali, formerly Mathematical Biology, now Kings College London; Q Xu, Developmental Biology). We are using optical tweezers based force transducers to study the mechanical interactions of single myosin molecules with their filamentous binding partner actin. These studies provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of production of force and movement by these motor proteins. The mechanical methods developed for this purpose can also be adapted to study protein-protein interaction in general or protein-DNA interactions, but also mechanisms on the cellular level and we are currently developing an optical tweezers based transducer with a novel detection sensor to enable these studies to be made. One aim is also to combine mechanical and fluorescence measurements on the single molecule level, to relate mechanical and biochemical states of interacting biomolecules. The development of methods in our team is within the context of understanding molecular mechanisms in biology, molecular biophysics /medicine. Examples for future implications of this kind of basic research are the roles of myosins in hearing or vision, in cell division and cancer, in parasite infection and also heart diseases. My lab currently consists of one investigator scientists, three postdocs and one shared PhD student. Another postdoc (EU funding pending) and a shared PhD student will join the lab at the beginning of 2007. The research projects have multiple strands with good thematic and technical overlap between the different projects. Specifically: Team leader (CV) - Development of an optical tweezers based force transducer for measurements of interactions and conformational changes of biomolecules at millisecond time resolution. Studies of load dependent conformational changes of myosin motors. Investigator scientist (SS) - Software development for an optical tweezers based force transducer.
