By utilising the findings of the successfully completed ESRC project ?Assessing eye sight and ocular health? it will deliver a communication skills package that will benefit optometric practitioners, trainers and organisations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite the growing importance of the role of optometry in healthcare provision in the UK, the attention given to communication skills in training and CPD remains under-developed compared to other healthcare fields. Undergraduate courses in the UK now all include an element on interpersonal skills and communication. However, the evidence base relating to optometric interactions is still in its infancy. Although communication is starting to appear in CPD, it is still relatively rare. Meanwhile ?poor communication? is frequently cited as a major source of patient/client dissatisfaction in eye care. The provision of high-quality, analytically based communication skills guidance therefore has the capacity to make a significant impact on professional practice.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will deliver this impact: a series of knowledge transfer activities will be conducted, each drawing on findings from the previous ESRC project. These activities will culminate in the production of a communication skills portfolio to be distributed to and used by optometric centres and individual practitioners and trainers as a tool for long-term professional development.&lt;/p>
&amp;nbsp;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has arisen in light of dissemination activities conducted as part of the original project. At conferences such as Optometry Tomorrow and in workshops organised as part of the project, participating optometrists frequently remarked on how relevant our observations were for their work and for the training and continued education of practitioners. 

The project furthermore addresses a significant need in contemporary healthcare and adds value to communication skills training in optometry through a series of analytically and empirically informed knowledge transfer activities. As such it has very firm links to the ESRC's strategic plan: in particular it draws on evidence to identify effective interventions that lead to improved health and well being (p. 07) as well as advancing professional skills (p. 12 ). Furthermore, the sustained contact with users and beneficiaries throughout the project ensures that its impact will be maximised (p. 61). 

More specifically, the project outcomes will be to the benefit of:
- Individual optometrists and student optometrists who will be provided with guidance relevant to everyday concerns of both students and qualified practitioners.
- Optometry clinics and practices will be given guidance on how to enhance their collaboration with colleagues, for example through observation and reflection activities.
- Our dissemination activities will demonstrate to professional optometry organisations and policy makers that detailed empirical research of optometric practice can be beneficial to optometrists' education and training as well as to their day-to-day work. 
- Optometric patients will benefit from improved optometric service and care. The patient experience of optometric practice will be enhanced.
- The academic and research community will be provided with a case that demonstrates how an ESRC funded project can have substantial impact on professional practice.

The relevance of the project's outcomes for the optometry profession will be ensured by our partnership with the College of Optometrists. Members of the College will contribute to determine the precise content of the communication skills training programme. They will also attend and provide feedback on seminars and workshops that we will be holding as part of the project. Their feedback will be implemented in the development of the communication skills portfolio.

The project also resonates with King's College London's mission to 'create a healthy society' and to consolidate links between clinical and academic work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45230</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The College of Optometrists</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Knowledge Exchange</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0D1C4A9-B36D-4562-A702-810533A627CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- communication skills portfolio

The College of Optometrists have published large parts of the Communication Guidelines on the website.

http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/research/funded-projects/commissioned-research-2.cfm/The%20practical%20work%20of%20the%20optometrist

The Communication Guidelines are accessible to the the general public.

The College of Optometrists now is in the process to further use the material from the project to develop specific Continuing Professional Development activities for their stakeholders. The academics who worked on the ESRC-funded project are involved in the development of this material.

We also have run a series of workshops on communication skills with optometrists, both at King's College London and in optometrists' practices. The content of these workshops was informed by findings from our scoping exercise that revealed optometrists' requirements in terms of communication skills and from findings of the original ESRC-funded research project on The Practical Work of Optometrists.

The findings were used for the design of workshops we have held at optometry departments of universities. We used the scoping exercise and findings from the original project to design course material and create interactive sessions with students that highlight the importance of communication and communication sills for optometrists. Professors of Optometry who took part in the workshops report that they use content of the courses in their teaching and course development.

We also have published 2 articles in the practitioner magazine Optometry Today. The articles inform readers about communication practices and offer them activities they can undertake to gather professional development points.

The activities conducted as part of the project, in particular the practitioner workshops and the published articles in practitioner magazines have influenced optometry practice, in teaching and training as well as in continuing professional development. The impact in the effectiveness of practice will seen in the future when practitioners use the material published on the website of the College of Optometrists at the moment and developed by them at the moment. With the help of the College of Optometrists the practical activities designed for professionals to use to reflect on their own practice will become more generally applied and we will see an enhancement in the quality of the healthcare service the UK population receives from their optometrists.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B5C97D60-EA3E-42A6-927A-DEF53C2FA429</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54590c29189247.59738073</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Knowledge Exchange grant funded by the ESRC was based on a research grant previously funded by the ESRC. It was NOT a research grant but designed to exchange findings from the previous funding to practitioners and practitioner organisations, including the College of Optometrists, practicing optometrists and teachers and trainers involved in communications training at university departments of optometry.

The principal outcome of the Knowledge Exchange Project was a document provisionally entitled &amp;quot;Communication Guidelines for Optometrists&amp;quot; that currently is being prepared for publication by the College of Optometrists. The Guidelines Portfolio highlights some of the challenges that optometrists face when communicating with clients and patients during consultations and provides instructions and examples of how optometrists can use video-recordings of consultations to reflect on and improve their practices. 

Save for the Communication Guidelines the project also resulted in a couple of publications on visual research methods for the study of optometrists' work and a research paper examining in detail the interaction between clients and optometrists during the subjective refraction test, an optometric procedure that determines clients' quality of seeing by virtue of the use of lenses.

Throughout the project we have maintained a blog where we briefly discussed our plans and activities and highlighted some of the outcomes from our work.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Once published by the College of Optometrists the Communication Guidelines can be used by practitioners as well as by communication teachers and trainers. In particular the information and instructions on the use of video-recording as a reflective tool coupled with examples will provide practitioners with an important resource to improve on their communication practices.

Furthermore, we have published 2 articles in the practitioner magazine Optometry Today that informs readers about communication practices. The articles include activities that practitioners can use to gather professional development points.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>14171661-CA99-4253-80FB-A6ACEE984D36</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54590f8175ff09.84792140</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://keprojectoptometry.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6C93992B-4460-4224-9D3E-F504419FE3AF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Analytic Affordance: Transcripts as Conventionalised Systems in Discourse Studies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/63c35dbbb8011b14751beee4848ba58a"><gtr:id>63c35dbbb8011b14751beee4848ba58a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gibson W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542eb5e440a976.91108944</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B47FCBC4-E074-4691-BEBB-E48F1E27DB16</gtr:id><gtr:title>Objective Measures and Subjective Reports: examining optometric practice</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Review of Qualitative Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/22b1de5c4b234cd092668cd870277ff9"><gtr:id>22b1de5c4b234cd092668cd870277ff9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>vom Lehn, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>542eb6e4478fc8.28030734</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9BC50263-252F-4A0D-BD9E-B95EEDEF5B36</gtr:id><gtr:title>Communication: part 2 - delivering findings and advice to the patient</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optometry Today</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/09e78f12088598433674132e3f5b145e"><gtr:id>09e78f12088598433674132e3f5b145e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Webb, Helena</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542eb2f75e4c31.40031356</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6A1F630-C253-450D-810A-EF47078EBEA2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Communication: part 1 - soliciting information from the patient</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optometry Today</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/941ce90889cbeef0f4beb42561b42a32"><gtr:id>941ce90889cbeef0f4beb42561b42a32</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Helena Webb</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542eb27db06115.64479872</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K005588/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
