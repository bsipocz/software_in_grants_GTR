Despite the fact that the technology of glass manufacture has been known and exploited for thousands of years, relatively little is understood about how and why a liquid cools to a glassy rather than a well-ordered crystalline state. It is believed that that clues to the nature of the glass transition can be found by studying the evolution of the dynamical behaviour of the atoms as the transition is approached: whereas the transition to an ordered state is accompanied by relaxation which is exponentially dependent on time, it has been known since the work of Kohlrausch over 150 years ago that disordered and glassy systems relax non-exponentially. Although this non- (or stretched-) exponential relaxation seems to be ubiquitous, its origin remains controversial. Indeed it is still not clear whether it arises from parallel or hierarchical processes, or a combination of both.In some ways spin glasses, in which the orientation of the magnetic spins rather than their positions freeze into a random state, are relatively simple model systems with which to study glassy behaviour. Our recent neutron and muon beam measurements on a variety of spin glasses seem to indicate that a novel theory based upon probabilistic considerations may offer an appropriate model with which to describe the relaxation above the glass temperature. Moreover we have also demonstrated links between this model and recent thermodynamic theories based upon cooperative disorder , or non-extensive entropy, which are also useful in characterising phenomena such as earthquakes and tornadoes. If this connection can be proven we will have a scheme by which various types of both spin and structural glasses (eg fragile and strong glasses) can be understood, characterised and parameterised in terms of their fundamental thermodynamic properties. The aim of this proposal is therefore to use neutron spin echo and muon spin relaxation techniques to extend our preliminary, limited, survey of spin glasses to test rigorously the applicability of the new probabilistic relaxation theory and its relationship to the theory of non-extensive entropy in order to establish a universal thermodynamic approach to understanding the glass transition and to provide an explanation for Kohlrausch relaxation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164923</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Neutron and muon beams are extremely sensitive probes of the structural, magnetic and dynamical properties of solids. In this research we have exploited such beams in the study of two outstanding and fascinating problems in solid state physics: that associated with the glass transition and that associated with time reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors. 



Despite glass technology being exploited for thousands of years relatively little is understood about how and why a liquid cools to a glassy (disordered) state rather than a well-ordered crystalline state. It is believed that that clues to the nature of the glass transition can be found by studying the evolution of the dynamical behaviour of the atoms as the transition is approached: whereas the transition to an ordered state is accompanied by relaxation which is exponentially dependent on time, it has been known since the work of Kohlrausch over 150 years ago that disordered and glassy systems relax nonexponentially. Although this non-(or stretched-) exponential relaxation seems to be ubiquitous, its origin remains controversial. In some ways spin glasses, in which the orientation of the magnetic spins rather than their positions freeze into a random state, are relatively simple model systems with which to study glassy behaviour. Our neutron and muon beam measurements on a variety of spin glasses seem to indicate that a novel theory based upon probabilistic considerations may offer an appropriate model with which to describe the relaxation above the glass temperature. Moreover we have also demonstrated links between this model and Tsallis' recent thermodynamic theories based upon &amp;quot;cooperative disorder&amp;quot;, or sub-extensive entropy, which are also useful in characterising phenomena such as earthquakes and tornadoes. Our neutron spin echo measurements have enabled us to identify what appears to be a &amp;quot;universal&amp;quot; temperature dependence of the sub-extensivity parameter in spin glass systems over a wide range of temperatures above and below the glass transition. We therefore believe we have developed a method by which various types of both spin and structural glasses (eg fragile and strong glasses) can be understood, characterised and parameterised in terms of their fundamental thermodynamic properties.



Most physical processes are time reversal invariant, and therefore systems which break time reversal symmetry (TRS) are both rare and interesting. Superconductivity provides a paradigm for symmetry breaking, and in some superconductors a variety of symmetries, including TRS can be broken. TRS breaking can be detected through an increase in the muon spin relaxation rate produced by the spontaneous onset of magnetic fields below Tc and such behaviour has been observed in exotic centrosymmetric superconductors such as Sr2RuO4). However, non-centrosymmetric superconductors - materials whose crystal structure has no central symmetry point - are also particularly interesting as the way the electrons in the material pair up in the superconducting state can take unusual forms. One example of a non-centrosymmetric superconductor is LaNiC2 (critical temperature Tc=2.7K). Our muon experiments on LaNiC2 are particularly exciting as they have shown for the very first time that TRS breaking can be observed in such non-centrosymmetric superconductors.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F7ECBC5E-5AFA-4915-B065-D272AC614755</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4540851781.64844677959ea0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F8D54F12-DFA0-4732-BD02-C795DC8D15D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evidence for a spin emulsion.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/71c2b6572fd25d8229241eb1bbc44688"><gtr:id>71c2b6572fd25d8229241eb1bbc44688</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bentley PM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d05205257b682f</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EAD75314-5B2C-4384-B6A7-A19D18BBB528</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural and dynamical study of moment localization in</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/01b6c39697e943a23f1add227e6f742b"><gtr:id>01b6c39697e943a23f1add227e6f742b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stewart J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d04f04f696470d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AE3940FB-B6C0-470F-ACBB-8418F18B8387</gtr:id><gtr:title>Generalized spin-glass relaxation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ad9821e420459559f37d330d9ef593fe"><gtr:id>ad9821e420459559f37d330d9ef593fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pickup RM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d05205280e16a9</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1EAAD05A-1D7D-48EB-8F65-AD7EE4FAC15D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Relativistic analysis of the pairing symmetry of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/30f3b47774cdde0d8630315ca821d2b6"><gtr:id>30f3b47774cdde0d8630315ca821d2b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Quintanilla J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d04f04f7062c56</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C7F555DA-4063-4E9F-A8DE-1FAE9B93CBC8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor LaNiC2.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3eec527f7f6f8516075cc7a79b1b5366"><gtr:id>3eec527f7f6f8516075cc7a79b1b5366</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hillier AD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0520528920d1c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F021178/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>CE1ECB0B-443F-4711-8937-5AA8935A9940</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/F021178/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>164923.94</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2008-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>DBBF075D-3845-409F-BCED-E60B2E9B81FA</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/F021178/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>128727.38</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97B14C81-E082-430E-BC8F-733274083163</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Supercond, magn. &amp;quant.fluids</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9767B5B6-94F7-4DF6-8415-C15629D67796</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complex fluids &amp; soft solids</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82ED9103-D186-4890-9D3B-81796E616DBD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Magnetism/Magnetic Phenomena</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
