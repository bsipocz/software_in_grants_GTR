Malawi also faces significant challenges in establishing and operating a food and nutrition security programme. Our innovative solution is to establish production of a high-protein, micronutrient rich crop (Moringa oleifera), which will be locally grown by smallholder farmers, and processed on-site to supply Malawi's proposed scaled-up nutrition programmes. This project will not only contribute towards nutritional security for the poorest and most vulnerable in Malawi, but will deliver recognised additional economic benefits through two commercialisation opportunities; provision of functional plant-based protein isolates as an increasingly desirable food ingredient for local and export markets and scientifically-evaluated fair-trade products to enter the growing international market for nutraceuticals. We have partnered with Africa Growing plc who have provided significant investment in proof-of-concept Moringa plantations in Malawi since 2011. Strong networks and collaboration agreements are in place with the National Farmers' Association (100,000 members), which will help sustain local economies. Contract growing by smallholder farmers ensures the benefits cascade down to the rural population, providing a product grown in Malawi, processed in Malawi for the people of Malawi. 

Moringa is widely regarded as a 'miracle tree' it has been described by many as 'a nutritional and medicinal cornucopia' and all parts of the plant are edible. Our preliminary data has shown that Moringa leaves, which can be repeatedly and sustainably and cropped are high in protein (28%) and fibre (14%). The commercial source analysed was found to be extremely rich in beneficial bioactive constituents considered to contribute towards prevention of life-style-related diseases (type-2-diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer), as well as important micronutrients. Moringa performs well in less-fertile soils and being drought resistant and perennial is likely to be more resistant to climatic change. Additionally, sequestration of CO2 will contribute to climate change mitigation. This proposal will evaluate the nutritional and economic value of Moringa grown in Malawi. We will assess the nutritional composition, grown across several sites in terms of its potential to contribute towards meeting the nutritional requirements of vulnerable groups. With 47% of children stunted, infant mortality at 11.2% (live births under five) and maternal mortality (675 per 100,000 births) one of the highest in the world, young children and expectant mothers are an important target group. HIV/AIDS sufferers also benefit from improved nutrition, as efficacy of current anti-retro viral drugs require a nutritious and balanced diet. We will compare Moringa to the supplemental formula adopted by the World Food Programme, which is currently imported from multinational chemical companies. This will be evaluated in human dietary intervention, providing evidence beyond that of product labelling. The project will identify additional economic opportunities for Malawi by exploring the development of novel GM-free, protein-rich functional food products and fair-trade scientifically evaluated nutraceuticals, both of which are highly desirable in growing international food and health markets. This will lead to greater empowerment of the country, enabling it to influence its own nutritional and economic future. There is also potential to expand the project into other LMICs where severe malnutrition is a concern. Additionally, it will strengthen the UK research base, allowing researchers working in nutrition and food formulation to benefit from working in a socioeconomic setting, identifying barriers to effective translation and establishing connections with academics, government and non-government organisations in Malawi.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Provision of adequate nutrition in Malawi is critical, but significant challenges exist in establishing and operating a food and nutrition security programme.

The nutritional composition (macro-, micro-, anti- and non-nutrient content) of Moringa grown across several sites will be evaluated and compared to the supplemental formula adopted by the World Food Programme in an adequately powered human dietary intervention, providing evidence on the bioavailability of micronutrients beyond that of product labelling. Technology developed to produce functional protein-rich formulations from legumes will be adapted for the sustainably cropped Moringa leaves, providing a palatable, protein-rich isolate with functional properties, which being fair-trade and GM-free will be a desirable food ingredient and commercial opportunity for companies with or adopting a sustainability plan. Additionally, the bioactive constituents (several hundred, some of which have been shown to be anti-inflammatory, geno-protective, redox active) will be characterised by targeted LC-MS, providing a scientifically evaluated fair-trade nutraceutical to enter the increasing international health market for these products. Using an ex ante cost-benefit appraisal the social and economic aspect will be evaluated.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries from this project will be:

Vulnerable individuals in Malawi: most importantly young children, expectant mothers and HIV/Aids sufferers, but also the wider community. The major aim of this project is to address the hunger and malnutrition in Malawi. Moringa will deliver both nutritional and economic benefits, which will have the greatest impact in this group.

Smallholding Farmers, local co-operatives and food processors: Moringa has potential to enter the global market as both functional food ingredients and a fair-trade nutraceutical. This could provide new opportunities and significant economic benefits for growers, producers and upstream processors and distributors. It could also stimulate new industry.

Investors: There will be opportunities for small-scale investors to facilitate re-investment in nutritional programs bringing economic gain and benefits to the wider community.

Women in Malawi: Through an established connection with the County Director at Environment Africa and Executive Director of Women in Business in Malawi we hope to stimulate gender empowerment, specifically to encourage women growers and producers.

Project Partner: Providing scientific evidence for the benefits of growing and utilisation of Moringa as a crop and export product in and for Malawi will benefit the project partner in terms of growing their investment and reinvestment.

General public: Raising public awareness regarding the importance of increasing plant protein in the diet will benefit them in terms of improved health and contribution towards a more sustainable and resilient food supply chain.

Other LMICs: Success adoption of Moringa by smallholder farmers will provide a model for other LMICs, through the versatility of Moringa or with other crops.

Food/Nutraceutical Supply Companies: Provision of novel functional food ingredients and a fair-trade well characterised nutraceuticals could benefit international supply companies, increasing international sales with benefits back to Malawi.

Academic partners (as detailed separately): This includes the research team, junior scientific staff (to be appointed), other UK/EU-based research teams, researchers in Malawi, other international researchers in LMICs.

Longer term and Wider Benefits: Increasing consumption of sustainable plant-based food will mitigate against the anticipated protein-supply concerns, improve health by reducing meat consumption, increase biodiversity and providing a more resilient food supply chain. Utilization of wild and indigenous crops, which grow in less fertile soils and are resistant to drought, require less agricultural and energy inputs and are also likely to be more resistant to climate change. In the case of Moringa sequestration of CO2 will contribute to climate change mitigation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>480400</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P022847/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>446B7E7F-04EB-4121-9CC6-9171277E00DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diet &amp; health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA017EDD-C008-4338-ABE2-A7D9EEA68E82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6A8697C-69DA-4020-8D45-9901CA002827</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Global Health and Medicine</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
