According to National Statistics for 2015, 58% of women and 68% of men in the UK were overweight or obese. Figures also suggest that, worldwide, 2 billion adults will be overweight or obese by the year 2030\. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of many illnesses, including diabetes, stroke, depression and certain cancers. Left unchecked, this trend will culminate in an unhealthy, unhappy population that places a large strain on the NHS.

While many people have tried to lose weight and keep fit using various diet and exercise programs, it's estimated that over 95% of these programs fail. One major reason for this is the inadequate tailoring of diet and exercise programs to an individual. We all differ with respect to our genetic make-up, the way our bodies function, and the lifestyles we live. Consequently, health and fitness recommendations that work for one person, may not work for another person.

FitnessGenes is a company that analyses an individual's genetic, personal and lifestyle data to create individually-tailored dietary and exercise plans based on proprietary modelling. Already deployed commercially in a product aimed at fitness enthusiasts, the next phase of development is to test and further develop this model in a healthcare setting. This presents new challenges, including users who may lack the enthusiasm, opportunity and/or education required for making healthy lifestyle choices.

By allowing us to identify the different technological and prototyping requirements for various patient cohorts, this feasibility study will enable us to prepare our current platform for use in the healthcare system. By gathering data, as well as feedback from patients and clinicians, the aim is to to adapt the model so that it can make accurate and reliable diet and exercise recommendations that are delivered to the patient in an effective manner. This will allow us to cater for individuals who require customised nutrition and fitness programs for health reasons, such as patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, or those are at risk of developing these conditions.

The information presented to customers will be positive, educational and most critically, actionable. Ultimately, the most significant and high impact outcome of this project will be the creation of a novel prototype applicable to a healthcare setting, that contributes towards the prevention of obesity and chronic disease improving compliance with government and scientific advice, thus improving overall public health outcomes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49097</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">133434</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
