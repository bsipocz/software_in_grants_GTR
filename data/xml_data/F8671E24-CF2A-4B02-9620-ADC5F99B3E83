Some examples for such systems are galaxies, plasma and dilute gases. 
One of the most important equations in Kinetic theory, one that describes the evolution of the distribution function of a dilute gas, is the Boltzmann equation. Discovered originally by Maxwell (in some form), the equation is named after Boltzmann due to his many contributions to its investigation. 
In his work, Boltzmann introduced a new quantity called the entropy, measuring the disorder in the problem, and showed his famous H-theorem: The entropy must decrease along solutions to the Boltzmann equation. Combining this with the observation that the Gaussian function is a time-independent equilibrium to the equation, Boltzmann managed to deduce that solutions to the Boltzmann equation must converge to an appropriate Gaussian function as the time goes to infinity.
Unfortunately the Boltzmann equation has an intrinsic problem - it is not reversible in time. If we assume that the laws governing the evolution of the particles are reversible in time, we would expect to find that after long enough time the system had returned to its initial state, contradicting Boltzmann's convergence result. The key to see why there isn't any contradiction was given by Boltzmann himself: the idea is that the equation may still be valid in a time scale that is much shorter than that it will take the system to return to its original state. As such, the question of how quickly the solution to the Boltzmann equation converges to the equilibrium state is of paramount importance in Kinetic Theory. The main goal of many studies, this programme included, is to show that the rate of convergence is exponential.
There have been many attempts to try and show how reversible Newtonian systems can lead to an irreversible equation. The most successful ones so far involve many particle systems, which converge in some sense to an irreversible equation as the number of particles goes to infinity. A prime example to this is Kac's and McKean's Models. In both models we consider a system of many particles undergoing binary collisions with randomness in the scattering process. Focusing on only one particle and letting the number of particles go to infinity yields the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation (or a simplified version of it in one dimension) as long as we assume chaoticity, that is, that any fixed number of particles become more and more independent as the total number of particles increases. 
Since the many particle models are linear, while the Boltzmann equation is very non-linear, we may try to find the rate of convergence to equilibrium in such models, and 'transfer' it to the limit. This programme has started at the late 1950s, and had several successes, yet to this day a satisfactory convergence rate from the linear models to the Boltzmann equation hasn't been established.
The goal of the proposed research is to prove a conjecture by Cercignani's on the rate of convergence to equilibrium using the entropy concept in the many particle system. We propose to do it by further investigation of the affect of moments of the one particle marginal on the expression attained from formally differentiating the entropy under the linear evolution, as well as investigating connection between it and the important concept of entropic chaoticity, which measures how far our distribution is from a completely 'independent' case. Another avenue of research this project will undertake is to try and see if one can find a better quantity to measure the distance between the evolved distribution and the equilibrium state. One prominent distance, that has proved useful in recent studies, is the Wasserstein distance.
Lastly, time permitting, we will investigate other possible convergence results, as well as the concept of chaoticity and entropic chaoticity in other many particle models.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research has many possible impacts, not all in the immediate field of Kinetic Theory. We list a few here.
1. The subject of Kinetic Theory lies in the cusp of many fields in Analysis, as was mentioned in the 'Academic Beneficiaries' section. As such, any progress in Kinetic Theory usually facilitates progress in each intersecting field, as well as connection between them. Such phenomena does not only hold academic merit, but also helps to create more collaboration between departments and groups, inside the UK as well as between the UK and other centres of Analysis.
2. The subject of Kinetic Theory has had more publicity recently, especially in France, due to Cedric Villani's award of the Field's Medal for his work in the field. Seizing this opportunity, the field has become a point of interest to the public in France, and much more media coverage than ever before has been designated to investigate people who work in this field. This presented, and still presents, a unique opportunity to impress upon the public how important our work as mathematicians is, to show that Mathematics is attainable, even to the general public, and to explain that funding and interest in mathematical research is not wasted. Continuing research in Kinetic Theory will only strengthen this position, and improve the popularisation of the Sciences.
3. The UK has recently shown more and more interest in the field of Kinetic Theory, acquiring people who are experts in the subject. The more research in Kinetic Theory that is funded, the stronger the Kinetic Group of the UK will become, facilitating more collaboration with strong existing groups in France and the US. This will enable cross-country funding from many Councils, as well as a larger appeal of the UK to many experts in this blooming field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234019</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>161220</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Austria, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Lise Meitner Fellow</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>M 2104-N32</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>A6F57BE5-D611-4E8A-B5D2-0F1872CF4EB0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>584fed3b87a5f5.79528041</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. An interesting geometric inequality that pertains to the relative entropy on the N dimensional Euclidean space (representing N particles in the system) measures the subadditivity property of it, i.e. what is the difference between computing the total entropy of the system and the sum of the entropies of individual particles. Seeing as the Euclidean space with the Gaussian measure, and the sphere with radius squared root of N in this space, together with uniform probability measure, are close in some sense, one can ask oneself if the above inequality is also valid on the sphere. In work by Carlen, Lieb and Loss the authors showed that with an appropriate definitions of marginals ('individual particles') the Euclidean inequality is violated, and the comparison constant is doubled - a deviation from the closeness of the spaces! Surprisingly, Carlen has shown that this leads to Villani's lower bound on the entropy-entropy production ratio. By following the proof, one notices that if one can get a constant that converges to the Euclidean constant (with a quantitative rate), then the steps in Carlen's proof will give a uniform in N (number of particles) lower bound on the aforementioned ratio.
In my work I have managed to show that under additional conditions on the total density function (related to kinetic quantities such as moments, Fisher information and etc.) one indeed can manage to get this desired improvement to the inequality. This doesn't only have implication in Kinetic Theory, but also gives conditions under which the Physical 'Equivalence of Ensembles' principle remains valid. 
2. In 2003, Villani showed that under certain condtions on a density function on the line one can get an almost Cercignani conjecture, where the dissipation of the entropy bounds a power of the relative entropy, with the power depending of kinetic quantities of the state. As the special family of conditioned tensorisation of a given function is somehow 'close' to the N-fold tensorisation of that function, one can guess that under the right rescaling one can get and almost Cercignani's conjecture for this family. Motivated by this idea, and identifying the crucial element of marginal cancellation that appears in conditioned tensorisation, my collaborators and I have defined a new notion of quantitative chaos and have used it to show that under certain conditions on the total density function one gets the appropriate almost Cercignani's conjecture.
Using this for the special case of conditioned tensorisation for solutions to the limit equation (Kac-Boltzmann) yields the appropriate inequality on the line for the flow of the equation. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that Kac's original programme has come to fruition: finding information about the limit equation, from the original many body system.
3. The Becker-Doring equations are a fundamental set of equations of a widely applicable model that describes the kinetics of a first order phase transition by giving the time evolution of the size distributions of clusters of a certain substance. While of different flavour, the many objects model shares some interesting features with Kac's model when it comes to investigating functional inequalities pertaining to entropy-entropy dissipation ratio. In recent work, my collaborators and I have investigated the appropriate Cercignani's, and almost Cercignani's conjectures, for the Becker-Doring case, and have given an optimal result, which is also quantitative. 
4. As Kac's model is intimately connected to the Boltzmann equation, I have become more involved with it, or more precisely, with its quantum bosonic version - The Boltzmann Nordheim equation for Bosons. This equation, takes into account quantum effects, that in the bosonic case, can create a blow up in finite time. This phenomena is known as The Bose-Einstein Condensation. Together with my collaborator, I have investigated the local theory of existence and uniqueness to this equation under mild conditions (moments and decay estimate) in the general non-radially symmetric regime. To our knowledge, this is the first of its kind result to date.
5. In addition to all the above, partial work (that soon will be completed) has been done on the linear Boltzmann equation (an equation that models many physical phenomena) in the case where the collision kernel is singular. Together with my collaborators, we have managed to develop and apply known techniques to investigate quantitative rates of convergence to equilibrium.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main contribution of my research, besides advancing the problem of Cercignani's conjecture and other fields significantly, is in the methods, concepts and techniques I've developed, as well as the connections I have made between fields such as Applied Probability, Optimal Transportation, Functional Inequalities and Kinetic Theory. More precisely:
1. In my work about the subadditivity of the entropy I have brought the realm of Optimal Transportation, and kinetic quantities, into the field geometric functional inequality. This tie, and the quantitative nature of the result, would hopefully encourage more communications between the communities.
2. In my work about the almost Cercignani's conjecture my collaborators and I have not only managed to shown the desired conjecture, but we have combined tools and concepts from Probability, new notions of quantitative chaos from Kinetic Theory, and common techniques for PDEs to show the above conjecture and its consequences. We hope that this is only the beginning of such work.
3. The crucial element of the investigation of rates of convergence to equilibrium in my work with collaborators on the Becker-Doring equations relied on a newly shown discreet log-Sobolev inequality with weights. This inequality will prove useful in other fields.
4. Lastly, the study of the Boltzmann-Nordheim equation involved a rigorous investigation of the affects of a trilinear term on the existence and uniqueness of the equation. This, along with other technical tools that were developed, should be useful in other highly non-linear problems of similar type.
5. Improved and new techniques were developed in a partial study for the linear Boltzmann equation with soft potentials. This methods will be applicable to other studies pertaining to entropy methods.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>927A81D3-B70A-4473-8BCC-60CAB5FA508F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544fb74ac79971.95809443</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9134AD2B-7E22-4D82-812E-F900C408C991</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the Cauchy Problem for the Homogeneous Boltzmann&amp;acirc;??Nordheim Equation for Bosons: Local Existence, Uniqueness and Creation of Moments</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Statistical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fe78b9ac2d4981d3b6aebeffccad1f76"><gtr:id>fe78b9ac2d4981d3b6aebeffccad1f76</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Briant M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d5dc8b28c89.04140320</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0E78A1CA-A490-4E0B-9922-12A18203486E</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the rate of convergence to equilibrium for the linear Boltzmann equation with soft potentials</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/60d10b655b2912a2dd42d6b5f005427e"><gtr:id>60d10b655b2912a2dd42d6b5f005427e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ca?izo J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a7846dba48772.29804513</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DC26DACB-B6F6-4E4B-9A6C-A03D26A61102</gtr:id><gtr:title>Trend to equilibrium for the Becker-D&amp;ouml;ring
