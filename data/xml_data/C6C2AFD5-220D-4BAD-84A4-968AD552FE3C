Vectors are important tools which have been used to investigate basic biology, including how genes function, how cells work and what controls the process of animal development. Many diseases are caused by faulty genes and so recently vectors have also been developed for use in gene therapy; where a functional copy of a gene is used to fix the defect. The most effective vectors have been developed from viruses which have evolved over millions of years to deliver genetic material into cells. To make viruses into safe tools, or medicines, the pathogenic properties of the virus have been removed so the virus can be produced simply in a laboratory for carrying specific genes of interest. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a lentivirus that has been made safe and is a commonly used vector for delivering genes to cells. This vector is very effective and has been used in clinical gene therapy trials. When HIV normally infects a target cell, it delivers its genetic payload directly into the host cell chromosomes and integrates it seamlessly, so that the viral DNA becomes part of the cell's genome or 'book of life'. This is very important for long-term experiments or treatments, because the DNA is delivered permanently. However, despite the fact that vectors are unable to cause infection, there are problems and side effects associated with integrating genes into the host cell's chromosomes. Not all of a cell's DNA is active; there are large regions of the genome that do not produce any product from the information that they contain. If the virus, or vector, inserts its payload into one of these regions, the chances of it functioning are reduced. Additionally, cells have also changed and evolved over millions of years to defend against DNA that is being delivered into them by viruses (or vectors derived from them). Mechanisms are present that can shut off production (or expression) from delivered genes and silence them. Lastly, a side effect of inserting DNA into a cell is that it can interfere with cell's own DNA and damage or alter existing genes. This is unlikely to cause any problems but if, when treating a person with an inherited disease, it affects a gene involved in controlling how a cell grows or replicates, then this can lead to cancer. Although this is a very small risk, it has unfortunately been observed in gene therapy clinical trials. An alternative is to use an HIV vector that has been altered to prevent it from inserting the DNA it is carrying into the target cell chromosome. These vectors are called integration deficient lentiviral vectors or IDLVs. These are no longer capable of integrating into the cell's genome, but this vector retains all other benefits of the integrating version. This has several consequences: Firstly, it should be safer. Because the delivered DNA does not integrate, it cannot disrupt any of the cell's own genes and this reduces the risk of causing cancer in patients. Interestingly, despite avoiding the problems associated with integrating into silent areas of the genome, IDLV do not work equally well in all cell types when compared to integrating versions of the vector, for reasons that are not clear. While they have been shown to effectively express genes in brain, eye and muscle tissue, they perform worse in liver and stem cells when compared to integrating vectors. This block could be due to many factors but because IDLVs represent a safer and viable alternative to those that integrate, it is important to investigate the reasons to find solutions or to ensure that expression of delivered genes is not eventually affected in tissues where they initially seem to work well. The aim of this project therefore is to determine factors that influence how integration defective lentiviral vectors function in different situations and use that information to produce an improved vector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Integration deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) deliver genes to a wide range of cell types, including non-dividing cells. They have the additional benefit of a reduced risk of insertional mutagenesis compared to integrating viruses. Following reverse transcription and nuclear delivery of the lentiviral payload, IDLVs form stable episomal circles, which provide long-term expression of transgenes in post-mitotic cells. As IDLVs lack an origin of replication, the episomes are diluted out of rapidly dividing cell populations. Consequently, IDLV are effective and safe tools for either long-term or transient expression, depending on the target tissue. It was thought that IDLV would not be affected by position effects that can reduce expression from integrating vectors, but variability and lower expression have also been observed from episomal vectors. The reason for this is unclear; while IDLV work efficiently in brain and retina, expression is generally lower in liver and haematopoietic stem cells, when compared to integrating lentiviruses. The aim of this project is to determine what factors may influence differential levels of expression observed in integrating and non-integrating vectors. Candidate causes include obstruction of viral entry and reverse transcription and nuclear import. Cell-type specific factors such as epigenetic effects influence integrating vectors, so these are also likely to affect gene expression from IDLV. Vector efficacy may also depend on both contents and context of what is encoded on the backbone. Using different target cells in vitro and in vivo we aim to elucidate the influence of factors on transgene expression using several vectors that are identical except for their promoter configuration and their ability to integrate DNA into the host cell genome. Information gained will lead to the development of a safer and more efficient lentiviral vector and applicable to generic vector design.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Investigating the controlling factors on episomal expression patterns will produce results that will have an impact on a community investigating many areas of biological science. The project aims to answer questions that could ultimately improve a versatile tool that could be used to express genes (or deliver nucleic acids) for numerous applications, including developmental and stem cell biology, homologous recombination, neuroscience and basic biology, epigenetics and control of gene expression. Medical sciences could also benefit if Integration deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLV) are applied to treatment of inherited diseases or for areas where short term expression is required, such as imaging and vaccination. All of these areas are of direct importance to healthcare and the general public. Because medical research funding is frequently obtained from charities, any advances in technology that could be utilized for biomedical applications could be used by those charities to improve public education and fundraising. Depending on the results obtained, further understanding epigenetic influences on delivered genes could have an impact on commercial drug discovery or production where negating interference from surrounding genes or silencing effects is of importance. Understanding epigenetic effects on extrachromosomal vectors would move the field of DNA delivery forward significantly, enabling generic improvements to be made to vectors of all types. This project has the potential to improve expression from delivered transgenes and has scientific impact for academic, commercial and medical applications. Consequently it would foster international collaboration as well as improve products or processes that are economically important to the UK, such as drug production. Following this 3 year project, it is likely that information would be rapidly disseminated through publication, presentation and collaborations and could be integrated into many different research areas with immediate effect. Where optimisation and application of knowledge gained to a novel subject or process is required, the impact would be visible within 5 years. Clinical applications are likely to take 10 years to become implemented. Disseminating data from this project to reach the wide audience who would benefit from it requires several different approaches. To improve the impact of the research, data would be presented at various national and international conferences and in open access journals that target a general readership, rather than a specific field. Our group collaborates extensively with other academic institutions both locally and worldwide and would actively encourage application of any relevant results to other groups' specialist area. Collaboration is not limited to academia and results would be disseminated to pharmaceutical, healthcare and specialised companies though direct and indirect contacts within the commercial sector. We are also involved in organising public outreach and education days as part of national conferences, where the impact of the research and its relevance to biomedical science and how it could enhance quality of life would be promoted to the general public, charities and the media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>370733</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this project was to investigate the biology of integration-deficient lentiviral vectors.

The impact of the results that we have obtained so far are as follows:
Academic: This project has required many additional collaborations to be formed to refine methods of examining the position of DNA within cells, and then to analyse the results. Researchers from Australia, The Netherlands and the UK are now involved in the analysis of data with specialist bioinformatics techniques. This approach is truly cross disciplinary, involving biologists, data analysts, computer scientists and bioinformatitians. Involving a large team has helped to shape and validate some of the research that they performing, or the tools they have developed and so will continue to inform and be used by a much wider audience when we make the tools publically available. 
The information we are gaining about the methylation status of our vectors and how they express their genes will be of interest to many researchers globally and we intend to publish our results shortly. 
We run a Masters degree course in Cell and Gene Therapy, in which the methods of gene delivery are discussed in detail, so results we are obtaining are presented to the students and discussed so they have exposure to unpublished, cutting edge results and the chance to interact with the people involved in the laboratory.

Economic and societal:
We regularly interact with members of the public, most notably at the annual public engagement event held by the British Society for Cell and Gene Therapy. Here we get the chance to discuss our work and the importance it has in science and medicine and the relevance it has to everyday applications. These events target mostly A-level students and young adults, but are open to all. This work has also been described in media interviews, including a radio broadcast with the Naked Scientist.
Most people are interested in the clinical application of the vectors we are investigating, and how they can be used for gene therapy of inherited and acquired disease. IdLV represent a potentially safer approach to delivering genes because the risk of insertions into the chromosome and interfering with cellular genes (and causing, in some cases, cancer) are reduced. Better understanding of how these vectors work will directly improve health and wellbeing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4D770E2C-BFE7-4BFF-B4B3-8043A107D4C8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463947a1d5eb2.17961540</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Summary
The aim of this project was to better understand the biology of HIV-1 viral vectors. These viruses are used to deliver genes for numerous clinical or basic-science applications and the standard, multiply attenuated and disabled vector integrates its genetic payload into the target cell's chromosomes. Mutant versions of this vector are available which cannot integrate, and so on many levels are considered safer and there is much interest in the development and application of these vectors. However, the amount of gene expression from the mutant non integrating form is generally reduced in comparison to the integration proficient vector, and a major goal of this project was to investigate why.
The most significant achievements from this grant to date are the optimisation of a technique to determine the location of the integration deficient lentiviral vector (IdLV) in the nucleus of a cell, which will inform us of whether this has any impact on expression levels of genes carried on the episomal (DNA that hasn't been integrated into the host cell chromosome). Additionally, we have developed a novel vector with the majority of the remaining unwanted HIV sequence removed. This has not been previously achieved and allows for further testing and understanding of the virus, whether it integrates or not.
The initial objectives of the project have not been fully met, although we expect ongoing analysis of data obtained through experimentation to provide the basis for a publication shortly.
The findings will be of importance to other researchers internationally who are applying IdLV to in range of different situations to answer biological questions in cells that are difficult to deliver DNA to.

Details are below:

Interim project findings.

This project aims to determine why integrating forms of HIV-1 - based lentiviral vectors express at higher levels than those which contain a mutation to prevent integration into the host cell chromosomes (Integration Proficient Lentiviral Vector, IpLV, versus Integration Deficient Lentiviral vector, IdLV).
- The pCMV-dR8.74 and pCMV-dR8.74 D64V (Yanez) plasmids which are used to package the virus in producer cells were sequenced. This identified a 2kb region of Gag-Pol containing over 80 nucleotide and 20 amino acid mismatches. A literature search revealed that Yanez et al 2006 cloned this region from a different HIV-1 strain when generating the D64V plasmid. We obtained pCMV-dR8.74 D64V from Dr Luis Apolonia differing from pCMV-dR8.74 only at the D64V residue (confirmed by sequencing). All 3 vectors were prepared in parallel and no difference in functional titre was observed. The reduced expression from IdLVs does not appear to be due to mutations in Gag-Pol other than D64V.
 - We have synthesised a new qPCR standard containing multiple target amplicons on single molecule so that the same standards could be used for different primer and probe sets in order to improve reproducibility. These standards were used to compare IpLV/SEW and IdLV/SEW expression and vector copy number titres in 293T cells. The results indicated that the frequency of expression per copy (%eGFP+) is the same between IpLV and IdLV proviruses, but the intensity of expression (MFI) is 18-fold less for IdLVs. These data suggest that IdLV proviruses are no more likely to undergo complete silencing than IpLVs, but expression from active copies is not as strong.
 - We transduced the pluripotent teratocarcinoma-derived P19 cell line with both IpLV/SEW and IdLV/SEW. The DNA was used to set up validated bisulphite-PCR primer sets for all HIV-1 backbone elements (5' LTR, PBS, packaging signal, RRE, 3' LTR) and the SFFV promoter. A 14 day timecourse experiment revealed earlier methylation of the packaging signal than the internal promoter in IpLVs as previously reported. The packaging signal and internal SFFV promoter in IdLV DNA appeared to be significantly less methylated by P19 cells than those in IpLV DNA 5 days after transduction. Methylation is associated with epigenetic control of expression levels and so is important in this context.
 - We met with Peter Fraser at Babraham Institute to discuss the practicality of chromosome conformation capture (4C) experiments to track the nuclear localisation of IpLV and IdLV proviruses in order to study the possibility that differences in provirus localisation affect access to the transcriptional machinery. He provided his 4C protocol and we adapted this for lentiviral LM-PCR. Provirus-chromosome junctions were successfully recovered from transduced 293T cells by 4C-LMPCR. The method is currently being optimised before processing the remainder of 4C material. The LM-PCR libraries will undergo next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to detect differences in nuclear localisation between IpLV and IdLV proviruses.

Updated findings November 2014

The importance of methylation in control of expression levels from integration deficient lentiviral vectors is ongoing. We have confirmed the original observations that integrated vectors (IpLV) are more methylated in P19 cells than integration deficient vectors (IdLV). Because this observation is counterintuitive (methylation of sequences is normally associated with a reduction in expression) we have collaborated with Dr Tristan McKay (St Georges University London) to test these vectors in an alternative system using ES cell lines to test the results. These experiments are technically demanding, not least because the IdLV dilutes from dividing cultures and so later time-points are difficult to obtain signal from. We have now optimised the bisulfite-PCR sequencing and have material ready to test from the ES cell cultures.
Experiments applying chromosome conformation capture (4C) have been carried out to adapt and validate the method to determine whether the location in the nucleus of the integration-defective episomes affects expression. 
Next generation sequencing has been performed on 4C samples from IdLV and IpLV treated cells, including controls. Because of the novelty of this work, we have had to approach experts in bioinformatics to help analyse and interpret the results, and so we are now collaborating with groups internationally. Preliminary work suggests that the IdLV may still be tethered to the DNA, and this is being checked with several analytical methods.
The relationship between methylation and expression from vector genomes is not definite and so alongside experiments outlined above, we have also adapted the study to take a novel approach at investigating the role of 'spacer' DNA upstream of the transcriptional unit. Work by Mark Kay and colleagues has demonstrated that in standard plasmids the presence of DNA between the end of the gene and the start of the gene (on a circular molecule) can interfere with transcription to a greater degree than methylation of the sequence. To test whether this is having an impact in the circular episome formed by IdLV, we have produced a novel vector, called LTR-1, with much of that region deleted. Despite efforts by many other groups, this has not been achieved to the level we have produced. This vector is now being used to test the hypothesis, but also because of the novel way which we have managed to delete most of the remaining HIV DNA, we are also fully characterising the vector and have planned follow on work which forms the basis of award BB/L024357/1.

Update March 2016.
Further collaborations have been set up to analyse date from the 4C experiments, which are designed to reveal the nuclear positioning of integrating and non-integrating vectors. Analysis of the sequencing data proved to be challenging, and multiple approaches have been tested by Erdogan Taskesen at Delft Technical University, and by Claus Hallwirth and Gagan Garg, Childrens Medical Research Institute, Australia. Preliminary findings showed no statistical difference between genomic associations with the integrating and non-integrating vectors. This made us re-assess the experimental design, in case longer was required between putting the virus onto the cells and measuring the outcome, as there was a risk of measuring contaminating non-integrated vector in the integrating sample (not all of the vector integrates and takes several days to dilute out). We have repeated the experiment with a 2 week growth period for integrating samples to investigate whether this influenced the results. DNA sequencing is pending.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Information gained from this work can be put to use not only by basic biological labs, but also in more applied settings, such as clinical applications of gene therapy using retroviral vectors and production of biotherapeutics (such as antibodies) in cell lines. The information gained so far is of use in a wider biological context, to understand the mechanisms of gene silencing and control of transcription, or how a gene product is produced, in cells. This research could be applied in many different areas, immediately and further when we have more complete information at the end of the grant. This would be of interest to researchers and companies in medical and veterinary sciences, biomedicine and developmental / basic biologists as a research tool, as well as many others. Interest in integration deficient vectors is still high as many groups would like to use transient gene expression to reprogramme cells (such as induced pluripotent stem cells) or assess a pulse of expression of transcription factors or other genes and IdLV can provide this.

Interest in the LTR-1 vector has been high and we have spoken to many groups about this and presented data at several conferences. We have shared this vector with groups around London, as well as in America and Italy, where it is being tested in different experimental settings, helping to further inform us about how it functions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>48E51D19-B69C-4CB8-8B42-015395C6C1AD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5832145824.872093777301f6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I00212X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
