Concerns over CO2 emissions and associated climate change impacts are also spurring technology efforts in order to make hybrid and electric vehicles widely available. Energy storage is a key issue that needs to be addressed within both these scenarios and supercapacitors will play a vital role.To meet future energy demands new generation supercapacitors must increase their energy densities at least two-fold over current commercially available devices, while maintaining response times of less than one second. They must also be low cost.We will use hard templating and novel microwave assisted synthesis routes to create structured electrode materials based on TMNs, addressing the key electrode features for supporting good electronic conductivity, good electrolyte mobility and plenty of surface area to increase the total charge-storage capabilities of the supercapacitor. State-of-the-art electron microscopy techniques will enable us to establish the critical link between material structure and performance.The success of this project will initiate a step-change in current research directions, basing new developments on high performing, low cost materials. These developments will see supercapacitors supporting upcoming technological developments including use in hybrid-electric vehicles, new portable electronic devices and in delivery grid systems which are supported by renewable energy sources.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Addressing energy storage needs is an important issue both worldwide and in the UK. The future use of supercapacitors spans a wide range of important technological fields including delivery of energy from renewable sources, hybrid-electric vehicles and portable electronic devices. The beneficiaries of this research span commercial end users, society in general and the people directly involved in the project work. 1: Commercial End-users. Development of new generation supercapacitors will benefit several industrial sectors including the automotive industry, and the renewable energy and portable electronic sectors. These developments will lead to new technologies and subsequent socio-economic impacts including wealth creation within the UK. In the short term, work on new generation supercapacitors will encourage these industries to seriously consider the implications of incorporating supercapacitors into their future developments. For example, wireless charging of mobile phones through supercapacitors is a prime example of where technological developments could head within the next 5-7 years. In the immediate future, supercapacitors may be incorporated into current designs for supporting camera flash applications and this will support continual development for charging applications. If successful, we would expect to see prototype developments within 5-7 years, with widespread adoption in 10 years. Similarly, new generation supercapacitors can be expected to support renewable energy sources for smoothing short-term power disruptions to national grid supplies and in hybrid-electric vehicle developments with prototype developments appearing within the next 5-10 years. 2: Society Shifting to clean renewable energy sources and technologies is paramount and improving energy storage capabilities on both a short and long-term scale is a key to achieving this shift. New generation supercapacitors will provide part of the solution. Long-term impacts on society will be evident in enhanced quality of life through reduction of CO2 emissions and climate change impacts as we increase our reliance on sustainable energy supplies. Additionally, we will be able to ensure a greater level of energy security, particularly in the EU where continuous gas supplies have been tenacious recently. 4: People This project will provide training in several scientific disciplines including materials synthesis, the field of electrochemistry and high-level electron microscopy characterisation. Moreover, running of the project will develop many transferable skills including project management, computing skills and a general understanding of the UK's energy economy. Together, the aquisition of these skills through the project work and training opportunities will develop people who will be able to immediately contribute to the UK's knowledge-based economy. Their skills could be applied in many employment sectors including other scientific disciplines such as fuel cell and hydrogen-based sectors, materials, technology and energy consultancy and education.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102164</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I029370/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
