Social scientists are interested in finding out how the environment influences our lives. Similarly, many biologists study DNA - the genetic material in our cells - to understand how we develop. Until recently it was thought that small differences in our DNA could largely explain the way we are. &amp;quot;It's all in the genes&amp;quot; was the assumption. We now know that the DNA sequence of an individual does not tell the whole story. The way DNA is stored in cells plays a key role in how genes are turned on and off. Such gene 'regulation' - termed epigenetics - includes a variety of mechanisms, such as the addition or removal of a methyl-group to one of the building blocks of DNA -- a dynamic process across life. Importantly, biologists have recently realised that environmental stimuli and stresses can influence gene regulation during certain stages of development. Understanding how genes become regulated would greatly improve our knowledge of why individuals differ. To answer some of these questions, we have established a network of researchers in epigenetics and social science to explore how early life stress influences reproductive health in females. We will focus on groups of Bangladeshi migrants that have been shown in prior studies to have different levels of reproductive function depending on where they lived when they were young. Those who grew up in Bangladesh (with greater exposure to infectious diseases) have consistently lower biomarkers of reproductive function, including hormone levels such as progesterone. We will use migrant Bangladeshis as a human case study to assess possible epigenetic mechanisms that might explain this lower reproductive function. Rates of epigenetic ageing will be compared between groups through analyses of DNA methylation patterns to assess whether early life stress has altered the epigenetic clock in these groups. In addition, we will evaluate the epigenetic stability of methylation patterns in one of the genes which is key player operating within the reproductive system, namely the luteinising hormone receptor gene (LHR). We will compare methylation patterns of the LHR across Bangladeshi groups to assess whether epigenetic mechanisms can help to explain differences in progesterone levels. We will also study epigenetic regulation of genes and hormones that control the processes of reproduction in mice that are exposed to different environments when they are young. We hypothesise that the treated mice will have a delayed onset of puberty and also lower levels of progesterone. We will look for changes in epigenetic packaging and modification of the DNA around the LH, LHR and other key genes between the two groups of mice that might explain any changes in hormone levels. We will also compare epigenetic signatures following treatment in different mouse tissues, such as ovarian and buccal (cheek) tissue. If these two tissues are similarly altered, this will indicate that buccal tissue (non-invasive) can be used as a source for future epigenetic studies in humans as well. The mouse buccal tissue will be compared to human buccal tissue from 24 Bangladeshi volunteers, 12 each from first- and second-generation groups. The research could inform us about presently unknown epigenetic mechanisms affecting reproductive variability that results from stress during early life development, as well as the utility of a mouse model for these kinds of studies. It will also highlight the possibility of using different tissue types to detect some of these epigenetic modifications. The study will present opportunities to train new generations of multi-disciplinary researchers. Finally, it will demonstrate the potential of targeted, cross-sectional studies in migrant groups to answer questions of interest to epigeneticists and social scientists, particularly about the importance of early life in influencing individual health and wellbeing during adulthood.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academics across the divide of biological and social sciences will benefit from the research because it forges a new, cross-disciplinary and international collaboration between biologists/epigeneticists (working on animal models, cell lines and theory) to social scientists working with humans. This means that results from the proposed study will be directly applicable to human health and wellbeing. At present, much research is emerging from epigeneticists that is not being applied to our own species, while on the other side, many social scientists make assumptions about potential epigenetic effects without having data to uphold these assumptions. There is a great interest among researchers from both areas in how early life stress and plasticity contribute to the phenotype in later life, and the research proposed here directly speaks to these issues. The data generated can thus inform future study designs by other researchers that aim to explore cross-cultural studies in humans in relation to environmentally-induced epigenetic change. Improved study design, based on solid data sets, ensures cost-efficient, high-impact research through public investment. 
 Global migration, international mobility and migrant integration are highly relevant issues for public policy and capture the public attention. This interest provides an excellent opportunity to engage with the community and the general public about issues relevant to migrant health. They will therefore benefit from our contribution to the understanding of processes involved in immigration, environmental stresses and basic biology. More specifically, the ethnic minority of Bangladeshis will directly benefit because they are providing the migrant model for the human part of this study. Any measures that promote improved understanding of migrant wellbeing will provide benefit to our society with respect to quality of life, health, creative output and economy. Policy makers appreciate the connection between immigration, health and economic success. Thus, in the longer term, our research has the potential to impact on areas of health and wealth. 
 We act in the strong belief that competitive academic research cannot and should not be separated from teaching. We will therefore integrate concepts and approaches of this research into our university-taught lectures and seminars that reach a broad audience of students across under-graduate and postgraduate levels. We will also train young professionals (both postdoctoral associates and students) in the course of our project in order to broaden their disciplinary horizons and skill-sets, attributes that they will then transmit to future generations of scholars. 
 Furthermore, the proposed work has the potential to identify novel diagnostic tools (biomarkers) that may be used to monitor or predict reproductive function and that could be patentable in the long-term future. This would be of immense value to women in many different contexts and could contribute to reproductive health. Any such patents and products would contribute to the economic health of the UK and its bio-industries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>176166</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Aside from creating a new collaborative network between social scientists and epigeneticists, our goals are to: 1) address whether there are key periods of stress exposure, particularly in early life, that may affect epigenomic stability across the life-course, and to 2) uncover potential epigenetic mechanisms to explain variation observed in reproductive function resulting from early life stress through: a) collecting pilot data using a mouse model , b) determining epigenetic stability using both Illumina 450K methylation arrays, as well as a more targeted analysis of concordant and discordant methylation patterns of a specific gene locus critical to reproductive function, and c) to compare some of these findings in different human tissue types to determine whether more accessible tissues (buccal) are of use in studies of reproductive function. 

In terms of the mouse pilot data, we have optimized protocols for mimicking early life stress and found this leads to a delay in pubertal onset by approximately six days. In addition, we have measured gene expression for key reproductive genes in these mice at ages 2-3 months and again at 8 months. We found there is a consistent drop in expression of the progesterone receptor gene and luteinizing receptor gene among the stressed mice compared to controls, while expression of anti-M&amp;uuml;llerian hormone is increased. We need larger sample sizes, however, to verify these findings. We have so far found no evidence for differential methylation of the progesterone receptor gene in the group of stressed mice. We have collected blood samples from treated and control mice for later analyses of key reproductive hormones, and we are establishing methods to compare the numbers of follicles (eggs in the ovary) among treated and control mice. 

We completed collection of cheek swabs from first and second generation Bangladeshi women from whom the DNA has now been isolated. Most of these samples are being analysed for methylation patterns at around 850,000 gene sites as well as two targeted sites, namely the progesterone and luteinizing hormone receptor genes. These data will also be compared to samples from the treated and untreated mice to assess the utility of using easily collected cheek swabs for epigenetic analyses as opposed to other forms of more invasively obtained tissue.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Still too early to report on this section.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9669D15B-3526-46D3-975D-3D957F7212E8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd6381299a10.05571609</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N000471/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F50F534E-2EE9-4970-AE8D-BAF7663379C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development (Biosciences)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6EF57B2-8ACD-48E6-9B45-98507446B053</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigenetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
