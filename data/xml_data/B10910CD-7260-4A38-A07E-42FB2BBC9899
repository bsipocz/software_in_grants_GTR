The University of Aberdeen (UoA) has a 100 year history of ground-breaking research in nutrition and health, led by researchers within the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health (RINH). The RINH is poised to move on to the UoA and NHS Grampian?s healthcare campus, sharing a site with our Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS) thereby providing an optimal environment and unique platform to instigate and develop new technologies to elucidate the primary molecules and pathways controlling body weight. Specifically, we aim to take our expertise to the next level and seek MRC Discovery funding to develop new technology and to deliver benefits through funded pilot studies and knowledge exchange activities. This untapped potential is important because, at present, strategies for obesity treatment are limited, reflecting a profound unmet clinical need. The primary roadblock in the abatement of the obesity epidemic is an incomplete understanding of how body weight is mediated. Research to date indicates that the brain is the master coordinator of body weight, employing a number of interwoven neurological circuits to continually appraise and respond to changes in nutritional state. How the processes work, which neural circuits are the key factors, and how they are disrupted to promote and maintain obesity is unclear. Here we seek an MRC Discovery Award to facilitate our vision of a future centre of excellence in obesity research in Aberdeen by: (1) developing technology to unlock neurobiological processes essential for the prevention and treatment of obesity and; (2) increasing capability and capacity in the neurobiology of obesity research through: (a) creating MRC Discovery Research Fellows in obesity research; (b) pump priming competitively selected pilot studies; and (c) establishing a series of collaborative networking events and efforts, including a seminar series to promote outreach and networking both within Aberdeen and between other centres of excellence and the UoA. This MRC Discovery Award will not only provide a means to identify crucial mediators of body weight with exquisite precision, but will also facilitate the positioning of the UoA as a leader of neuroscience technology and obesity research.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>450000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PechaKucha event: &quot;Warming up our fat&quot; Speaker: Dr Pablo Blanco Martinez de Morentin</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8AFCA68-812D-429C-A99B-0CEFF31E187B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>50 members of the public attended this event, which uses a normal format to bring research stories to a general public audience. The event is held in a local cinema, with presenters showing 20 images with 20 seconds available for each image. This novel format attracts a new audience, who are interested in finding out about research topics they haven't been exposed to before. This helps to inform the public about the research being undertaken in the research group. Discussion is encouraged after the event, with an informal discussion in the bar area.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c90ff9784b08.25843497</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cafe Scientifique (Aberdeen): &quot;Can our brain help us shed those holiday party pounds?&quot;, speakers: Professor Lora Heisler and Dr Lourdes Valencia-Torres</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B55CB78-632D-4106-9373-4C068EE1F3D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>106 members of the public attended the cafe event, which was part of a series that invites leading experts to share the latest scientific research with the public in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The speaker provides a short talk, then an audience led discussion forms the main part of the event, allowing the researcher to debate and discuss ideas with a new audience.

Evaluation was undertaken via feedback forms, of which 25 were returned. The feedback from the forms was very good, with both the topic and the speakers rated 4 or 5 out of 5 in 96% of the forms. Specific comments included 'wonderful speakers', 'very informative' and 'excellent topic and engaging speakers, enjoyed it greatly'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e348ad91e8.59524969</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.abdn.ac.uk/engage/public/events-50.php</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Projects within this MRC Discovery@Aberdeen award will extensively use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. This is a powerful tool for precisely modifying genomic DNA sequences. However, a significant limitation is that the efficiency of this process is variable depending on the cell type and complexity of the targeted modification. As a result, screening for cells with the appropriate, desired modification can be very time consuming. 

We have therefore adopted a fluorescent based screening technique reported previously (Kim et al., Nature Methods, 8, 941-3, 2011) and optimised its use in cell types of relevance in this project. This fluorescent reporter system allows visualisation of CRISPR/Cas9 activity and subsequent fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to recover only cells in which the Cas9, genome editing enzyme is active. 

We have adapted the fluorescent reporter system to make a plasmid reporter that specifically measures activity of CRISPR/Cas9 for the guide RNAs targeting our current genes of interest. The reporter plasmid contains an expression cassette for a red fluorescent protein (RFP), a linker that contains the guide RNA binding site followed by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette. In its unedited form the construct expresses only RFP as the downstream GFP cassette is out of frame and fails to encode the GFP protein. However, Cas9 mediated editing of the linker sequence, leads to insertion or deletion of bases which can shift the GFP cassette into frame resulting in expression of the functional GFP. This dual system allows one to determine the efficiency of transfection by assessing the expression of the red fluorescence (RFP) as well as subsequently sorting by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) of green fluorescent cells to specifically purify cells in which genome editing has taken place.</gtr:description><gtr:id>10D546B4-3F1F-42B6-B8EB-279FEC9CC4E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research tool will significantly improve the efficiency with which we can isolate cells bearing the desired modifications to genomic DNA sequences. So far this has been specifically used to identify successful editing in genes of initial interest for this project. However, the construction of the screening vector makes it simple to rapidly modify for all our subsequent projects within this Discovery Award, as well as for use by other investigators on other projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9016b194299.90927685</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Red-green reporter method</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>94576043-F8A5-48A9-A2E3-28D3BB8A6AFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lorcaserin improves glycemic control via a melanocortin neurocircuit.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular metabolism</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d070040adda7596710cd3df53504e06c"><gtr:id>d070040adda7596710cd3df53504e06c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Burke LK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2212-8778</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa655324e3120.65389920</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F35D914-20C3-47B9-A977-982C4786B0D0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adipose specific disruption of seipin causes early-onset generalised lipodystrophy and altered fuel utilisation without severe metabolic disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular metabolism</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/647778414304646fa27391da45b5db95"><gtr:id>647778414304646fa27391da45b5db95</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mcilroy GD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2212-8778</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6649da4d783.10619830</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_15077</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>93C4699B-9E5C-4982-9CCC-EFD5B9712D6E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.6  Resources and infrastructure (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
