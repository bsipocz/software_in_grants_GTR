Pitch Lake</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L00268X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Since 6000 BC, if not earlier, Trinidad has been the gateway into the Caribbean for waves of South American migrants - the first stepping stone in the long chain of islands that make up the archipelago. Its critical position to the settlement of the Caribbean is reflected in its deep archaeological record, documenting the complex interactions between its diverse peoples over millennia. Unique among its archaeological sites is Pitch Lake, one of the largest natural deposits of asphalt in the world (see Fig. 1 - Visual Evidence), which over the years has yielded extremely rare wood carvings - to date the largest concentration of ancient wood artefacts in the Lesser Antilles (of the 18 carvings known from the region, eleven were recovered from Pitch Lake). However, unlike any systematic archaeological excavation, these carvings have been dredged up as a consequence of commercial pitch harvesting (Fig 2), and any association between them, or the skeletal remains that were also recovered, have been lost. They are thus rarely discussed in the archaeological literature - they float outside chronologies, peripheral to the ceramic and stone foundations upon which Caribbean prehistory is based. 

Yet wood is among the most insightful of materials, lending itself to radiocarbon dating, stable isotope analyses and botanical identification - the latter two providing direct insights into people's interaction with their environment. The carving scars evident on these pieces echo the movements of those labouring over them and provide a window onto their past activities. Historical accounts from the 15th-16th centuries indicate that Caribbean cultures had rich wood carving traditions, and that much of their material culture was carved in wood - from massive communal houses to utilitarian objects such as canoes, paddles and vessels, to ritual items and ceremonial seats - and this heritage can now only be glimpsed through the handful of examples that survive in museum and private collections. This reliance on wood undoubtedly goes back to the first migrations - without canoes and paddles, for example, the islands could not be settled. Hence, despite the lack of context, the carvings from Pitch Lake - now held in three separate institutions - provide a unique opportunity to investigate the importance of wood artefacts, especially valuable in a context where wood was the basis of material culture, but rarely survives. The proposed research would be the first detailed, multi-disciplinary investigation of the Pitch Lake wood carvings, with the aim of placing these objects in a chronological and cultural perspective. 

From the artefacts (Fig 3) recovered from this one site we can potentially explore not only local adaptations, but regional influences and exchanges - as well as more esoteric/symbolic meanings. The methodologies enable a deeper level of investigation into the corpus - from the stable isotope analysis that can provide insights into the source of the trees used for the carvings, to the wood ID which can be cross-referenced with historical accounts of how such woods were used (from timber to medicinal knowledge). The deposit of burials and artefacts in the lake also suggests a deeper symbolism, one befitting such an unusual setting. Several myths collected during the 19th century, a time when an indigenous population was still resident in the area, recount that the lake was a portal through which the deceased returned in the form of birds to visit their descendants. The recurring themes in the legends, of death and the afterlife, give some support to the possibility that the area may have had a spiritual significance, one that may have had a considerable chronological depth spanning many generations. The lake could have had conceptual parallels to caves, used across the Caribbean for burials and the deposit of ritual objects - and as such a fitting area of ceremonial deposit and myth.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project develops collaborative networks between colleagues in diverse international venues, including wildlife and environmental organizations (Pointe-&amp;agrave;-Pierre Wildfowl Trust [PPWFT] and National Trust of Trinidad and Tobago [NTTT]), museums (the National Gallery of Trinidad and Tobago [NGTT], Peabody Museum of Natural History [PMNH], National Museums Liverpool) and academic institutes (Leiden University, University of Oxford, University of the West Indies and the Max Planck Inst.). The project's unique cross-disciplinary approach - a synergy between the arts and sciences - contributes to enhancing public awareness and understanding of Caribbean cultural heritage. 

The NGTT, PPWFT, PMNH are the direct stakeholders in the project, and through them, their local, target audiences as well as the wider international community-including academic as well as public sector beneficiaries (e.g., Caribbeanists, archaeologists, botanists, Trinidadian diaspora). The research highlights the benefit of long-term museum care and storage of cultural patrimony, most especially of objects whose value is not immediately apparent due to the paucity of associated information and their preservational challenges. Bringing these little known collections to wider attention by utilising their inherent research potential goes some way to justify the investment of care that continues to go into their safe keeping. 

While enhancing knowledge of current collections, the project also builds relevant holdings - such as the duplicate herbarium samples collected as part of the stable isotope project (deposited at the NTTT and NML), as well as the planned handling collections, commissioned from local artists, that will be integrated into museum activities and events. This contributes to engaging local communities and bringing Trinidadian wood carving heritage into wider discourse and public awareness by highlighting it as a rich resource for study, with implications for building understanding o Pitch Lake archaeology and its place in the wider archaeology of the circum-Caribbean. 

In addition to cultural sector benefits, the project contributes to wider social, economic and environmental issues - from working collaboratively with conservation societies (PPWFT and NTTT - aspects of this study highlight environmental issues such as the preservation of native trees) to drawing attention (via the web, media, etc) to Pitch Lake itself, a key tourist attraction upon which the local residents depend (as tour guides, vendors, taxi drivers, etc). Aside from tourism, the lake continues to be a vital economic resource for asphalt mining. The project contributes to highlighting the archaeological value of the site: there is every possibility that other artefacts may emerge as dredging continues, and raising awareness of the value of the artefacts contributes to the resource management of the site. The project has been approved by the Archaeology Committee at the University of West Indies, who advise government on site protection, and working in collaboration with these various stakeholders bridges different sectors and their remits, enhancing information across the disciplines. Further, the project contributes directly to the development and training at the NTTT and PPWFT, with the former providing staff and expertise for the stable isotope/herbarium collecting and the latter enhancing collections knowledge, which would in turn contribute to events (exhibit, tours) at the Centre. The PPWFT, a centre of excellence for local education about the natural environment (with innovative outreach and 'hands on' sessions for young children as well as training for school teachers and members of community based organisations), also has a long standing record of influencing local and international policy, and is an ideal venue through which to disseminate project results, directly contributing to socio-economic impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139934</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>NMAGTT is planning a redisplay of the Pitch Lake collection to highlight recent project work on artefact materials and chronologies.

The relevant tree species (Andira sp., Brosimum alicastrum, Carapa guianensis ,Guaiacum sp., Platymiscium trinitatis and Terminalia dichotoma) were selected entirely as a result of the wood identifications made on the 10 Pitch Lake artefacts (via the USDA Forest Service Centre for Wood Anatomy). The isotopic study, linking both Trinidad's natural resources and archaeological heritage, is the first of its kind, bringing new information and insight into the use of these trees.

It has made concrete contributions to the collections of both the National Herbarium of Trinidad and Tobago and National Museum Liverpool, through herbarium specimens collected as part of the strontium study. These function not only as a long-term resource for future researchers, but are unique in providing for the first time isotopic values for the specimens collected in Trinidad and Tobago. The herbarium/strontium isotope fieldwork was documented via a series of blogs aimed at making this part of the study accessible to a general audience, and these can be accessed here: http://blog.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/tag/trinidad-and-tobago/ 

One of the main heritage impacts is the way the project results have been made available and accessible to museum audiences via interactive re-displays, which incorporate handling collections commissioned directly from local artists. The aims of this are fourfold: 1/ to make the science-led results of the project - which document the chronologies, materials and provenance of the Pitch Lake artefacts - more widely accessible to the public, 2/ to involve local communities in the creation and interpretation of the replicas/artefacts, 3/ to provide, via the replicas, a tactile connection to the past, and 4/ to bring wider attention to the significant heritage value of Pitch Lake (most often viewed only as an economic or natural resource). The artist commission, which involves local partners in the cultural heritage sector, wood carvers and, critically, artists from the Santa Rosa First Peoples Community (representatives of Trinidad's indigenous community), is set to yield a variety of cultural benefits. Exploring the creative aspects of these artefacts - of their manufacture, purpose and meaning - is something that is being documented in video, with the direct involvement of a local film director. This will be available to both museum audiences and to a much wider international audience via short clips on the dedicated artist commission web pages that are currently being developed (the intro page can be found here: http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/collections/research/trinidad/artist-commission.aspx , and this will have further links as this part of the project progresses).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B69EED35-929D-47FB-9CFA-26473C912A33</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dec7a5d7d2a3.30798251</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This study has not only yielded the earliest examples of wood carving in the Caribbean, but considerably expanded on prehistoric wood technologies and resources - all of which establishes core information about the artefacts. They are now refining our understanding of the archaeology of Pitch Lake specifically, Trinidad generally, and more broadly, perishable organic material culture in the Lesser Antilles and the wider Caribbean region. 

Our newly developed pitch removal protocol was applied to the Pitch Lake artefacts for dating. These samples presented a particular challenge for demonstrating the removal of pitch prior to dating (and hence providing confidence on unexpected dates), as the contaminant (i.e. the pitch) is chemically very similar to that of the wood of the artefacts, rendering more routine techniques such as % carbon content or FTIR analysis ineffective. This study employed py-GC/MS and optical microscopy to look for residual pitch within the samples. The former technique is rarely used by the radiocarbon community, but this study provides an excellent case study to highlight it's suitability and applicability to radiocarbon dating of contaminated materials. 

The technique has subsequently been used by the applicants for a further study of pre-Columbian wooden artefacts from Florida that were contaminated with conservation treatments, and has the potential to be of use for the wider research of organic materials.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Among the findings that can be of use by others is the development of protocols for the removal of pitch contamination from wood - both for 14C and for strontium analyses. The investigative methodologies developed here - using a wide spectrum of scientific analyses to establish key information for objects of cultural patrimony - provide standards which can be applied by other researchers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ABEBF7CE-C74A-49A0-9303-99A891A8793B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56decb55de8cb4.61035462</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/collections/research/trinidad/index.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Collection care links between NMAGTT and NML</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>South America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AE310AA6-1CD4-4143-84EA-F970FE766FBC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d56c34563af1.31194616</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>In 2015, 131 herbarium specimens from Trinidad and Tobago were collected as part of the project's strontium study, and entered the collections of the National Museums Liverpool (duplicate samples were also acquired by the National Herbarium of Trinidad and Tobago).
