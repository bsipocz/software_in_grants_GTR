Numerical models will be developed and evaluated of a single device, calibrated against data from laboratory tests and field trials, and of arrays of devices, evaluated against data from laboratory tests. The approach draws directly on expertise of turbine array modelling at University of Manchester and of analysis of tidal turbine prototypes at Northeast Normal University. Unique datasets are provided by each partner from lab-scale array experiments at Manchester and field tests of a prototype at NENU. RANS BEMT and / or RANS Actuator Line models of a single turbine will be developed and the performance evaluated against prototype data from field trials. The mechanical and electrical power developed by each turbine is dependent on the variation of bearing friction with load. This will be quantified by NENU via laboratory tests and using data from field trials. The validity of RANS BEMT array models will be evaluated by comparison to detailed datasets for a fixed pitch turbine that are available to University of Manchester from earlier projects and which will be supplemented during this project. This will provide insight into the suitability of such RANS based models for turbine array simulations and into the influence of turbine operation on array yield. As such, interaction between energy extraction and resource will be neglected and the array configurations studied will be for row separations that are within the range of validity for RANS methods. Arrays of turbines with plastic bearings will be simulated to assess energy yield and inform assessment of the market, particularly in China, for the use of plastic bearings in tidal turbine applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In both the UK and China, ocean energy development is limited by uncertainty concerning the potential for cost reduction commercially acceptable rates. Technologies that reduce system cost are a key enabler in the development of a tidal stream market and realizing the potential contribution of this resource to the energy system. The application of novel plastic bearings and new passive variable-pitch turbine has been demonstrated to greatly increase the reliability of an offshore turbine. Understanding the contribution of this component type to array yield and standardization may reduce the system cost for tidal stream farms and would improve understanding of the potential market for high reliability tidal stream devices. Plastic bearings have been widely used in ocean engineering and new applications for such systems represent a larger market than traditional bearings in China. This project will provide important insight into the scale of this market and this is of particular relevance to the Hangzhou Jianghe Hydro-Electric Science &amp;amp; Technology Co. Ltd who partner with NENU on this project. .

The methods developed and the unique evaluation of RANS models for array applications builds on recent UK consortium projects and is closely aligned with the on-going EPSRC Marine Energy Challenge projects and the needs of the emerging tidal energy industry. The array simulations and evaluations proposed will provide insight into device-farm interactions and will improve understanding of approaches suitable for farm modeling. This work will also complement unsteady simulations of smaller arrays being conducted within parallel projects to improve understanding of the influence of ambient turbulence on turbine loading, including extreme loads, on wake generation and recovery. As such the methods and outcomes will aid ongoing efforts to establish coupled multi-scale models of turbine arrays. Further projects to progress this wider objective are under discussion, including with other UK and Chinese groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>122628</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UK China Tidal Stream Collaboration Workshop supported by EPSRC-NEWTON</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5CF6174D-55E4-40EB-B6A6-6D6099C6D740</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The UK-China Tidal Stream Collaboration Workshop was held in Dalian on 29-30 Jan 2015; it was hosted by Prof D Ning (Dalian University of Technology) and co-organised by Dr IM Viola (University of Edinburgh) and Dr T Stallard (University of Manchester). A link to the workshop website, including copies of the agenda and presentations, is available online. 

Talks were offered by six UK PIs and delegates from seven Chinese partner institutions of those EPSRC NEWTON feasibility projects that address tidal stream systems. The workshop was attended by 26 delegates. Background was given on some of the tidal stream research interests of those attending. Subsequently 13 technical presentations were given on topics ranging from device scale research through to floating platform hydrodynamics and array infrastructure. There was clear overlap between some of the project titles of interest identified by Chinese delegates and the topics of interest identified by UK delegates. All delegates split into three groups and discussed possible synergies in the identified thematic areas. The outcome of these discussions was then presented to the group and further refined, leading to identification of a number of areas of potential synergy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb5f4438e18.01014268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.uk-china-tidal.eng.ed.ac.uk/content/outcomes</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RCUK-SIN-UKTI Powering the future</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>181272D5-5FE0-4089-BF74-8C7A1067E0BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK Innovation Showcase with sub session addressing future UK-China challenges in offshore renewable energy including tidal stream and offshore wind.

This type of model would provide tidal farm developers with predictions of energy yield that are required for investment decisions. We have shown that loading of turbines within arrays of up to twelve turbines may be predicted to within about 8% providing important insight into the accuracy of energy yield prediction from tidal stream farms. 

We have extended a database of experimental measurements of the loading, power performance and wakes of arrays of up to twelve tidal stream turbines. This builds on data available from earlier EPSRC and non-EPSRC funded work. Summary data is now open-access following acceptance of journal papers. 

Developed CFD models of tidal stream turbines to assess the influence of alternative control methods (e.g. torque control requiring a simple drivetrain compared to speed control requiring a more complicated drivetrain) on turbine wake generation. This has demonstrated differences of mean loading (hence power output) when operating in arrays and of time-varying loading when operating in both current and waves.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings concerning the range of validity of RANS-BEM for tidal turbine modelling are being progressed in subsequent projects including via two PhD studentships. The published comparison and data are expected to be of value to the research community with interests in both tidal turbine wakes and wind turbine wakes. 

A dataset from experimental study of groups of tidal stream turbines in various array configurations has been documented as part of this project (building on datasets developed in prior projects one EPSRC funded and one privately funded). This data is summarised in a journal paper (Journal of Fluids and Structures) and is open-access via DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.3842.6482. The data is expected to be of value to researchers working on tidal stream system modelling advancing on earlier publications by the PI. 

The experimental methods developed have contributed to a fundamental study of the limiting effects of blockage on turbine performance in collaboration with Cooke, Byrne and Willden at University of Oxford. Numerical analysis of turbulent onset flow is also the subject of an in-review journal paper.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C0F95E95-063A-460F-B1CF-B672F58A8043</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddbac0e82726.14088907</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>WAKE VELOCITY AND ROTOR THRUST FROM TIDAL TURBINE ARRAYS BY EXPERIMENT AND RANS BLADE ELEMENT MODEL Generated by Olczak, A., Stallard, T., Feng, T. and Stansby, P.K. 2016 School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering University of Manchester, M13 9PL</gtr:description><gtr:id>41692E60-B8D3-4572-B03C-F082DD5C66C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing use by other research groups for model evaluation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c98442176501.30150446</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Dataset associated with Olczak, Stallard, Feng and Stansby (2016) J.
