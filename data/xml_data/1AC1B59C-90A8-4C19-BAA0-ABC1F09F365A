This is primarily a descriptive study to characterise the tolerability of single, ascending doses (10g, 20g, 30g, 50g) of cellodextrin, consumed in a food matrix. Six healthy, non-obese male and 6 female volunteers (age 18-40yrs, BMI 18-30kg/m2) would be recruited to allow estimation of a tolerance threshold with respect to adverse GI symptoms. 

Protocol Summary; 
Medical screening visit. 
4x Study visits 
Consumption of food product containing 10, 20, 30 or 50g of cellodextrin (on study visits 1-4 respectively)
Visits to be separated by at least a week
Completion of visual analogue scales for appetite and bowel symptoms for 9hrs after consumption 
Diet and bowel symptom diary kept on the day before and for 48hrs after each visit

Study 2 - Digestion and fermentation of cellodextrins
In addition to artificial gut studies, it is proposed to conduct an in vivo study assessing digestion and fermentation of cellodextrin in comparison with sucrose and polydextrose in 16 healthy, non-obese volunteers (M/F, age 18-40yrs, BMI 18-30kg/m2). Dose of cellodextrin would be determined from the tolerability study (Study 1). Breath samples will be collected for hydrogen assessment, and arterialised venous blood will be collected for glucose and insulin analysis.

Protocol Summary; 
Medical screening visit. 
3x Study visits 
Randomised, cross-over, double-blinded study design
Consumption of food product containing cellodextrin, polydextrose or sucrose (carbohydrate content matched)
Collection of breath and blood samples
Completion of visual analogue scales for appetite and bowel symptoms for 5hrs after consumption 
Diet and bowel symptom diary kept for 48hrs after each visit

Study 3 - Cellodextrins and appetite
This study would test the effect of cellodextrin, consumed as a midmorning snack, on subjective appetite, subsequent energy intake at the next meal and incretin hormones, in 16 healthy non-obese male volunteers (age 18-40yrs, BMI 18-30kg/m2). Dose of cellodextrin would be determined from the tolerability study (Study 1). A food product containing cellodextrin would be compared with ones containing digestible (sucrose) and indigestible (polydextrose) carbohydrate (matched carbohydrate content). The product would otherwise be the same on each occasion with a protein /fat/carbohydrate content reflecting a normal snack and an energy content of 200-250 kcal. This product would then be consumed once a day for 2 weeks, with the impact on energy intake at an ad-libitum lunch assessed on day 1 and day 14. Food diaries would also be kept during the 2nd week of each supplementation period and body weight measured before and after each 2wk period.

Protocol Summary;
Medical screening visit. 
6x Study visits (pre- and post a 2wk supplementation period) 
3x supplementation periods with a 2wk 'wash-out' in between 
Randomised, cross-over, double-blinded study design
Consumption of food product containing cellodextrin, polydextrose or sucrose(carbohydrate content matched)
Acute and acute-on-chronic response to the products
Completion of visual analogue scales for appetite and bowel symptoms for 4hrs after consumption 
Diet and bowel symptom diary kept for 48hrs after each visit
Three-day diet diary kept during week 2 of each intervention period</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The purpose of this project is to investigate the possibility of developing cellulose derived molecules as substitutes for sucrose in food and confectionery and then assess the gastrointestinal tolerability of these products and the impact on appetite and body weight.
After initial food chemistry studies and in vitro assessments of fermentability of the cellulose derivatives produced, we will undertake a series of human studies to determine the effects in vivo.

A series of studies will be performed in healthy human volunteers to assess 1) the tolerability of cellodextrins after oral consumption,2) the effect of chosen single doses of cellodextrin on plasma insulin and glucose and on colonic fermentation (assessed by measuring breath hydrogen generated by the colonic fermentation process), and 3) the acute (single dose) and chronic (14 days repeated consumption) effects of cellodextrin consumption on appetite, satiety and voluntary food intake and overall effects on body weight. The chronic effect of the cellulose products will also be compared with the effect of routinely consuming polydextrose, as we have shown potentialy beneficial effects of this substance on appetite and food intake.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to produce a new low calorie bulk sugar replacer from a sustainable source, which out-performs currently available alternatives in providing high quality chocolate confections without undesirable side effects at a reasonble price. This would provide an opportunity to develop a range of snacks which are lower in sugar and calories, without sacrifcing taste attributes. If this is successful then the potential commerical and societal impact is substantial. Not only would the new ingredient be used to produce lower calorie confectionery, but it will also be available to the food industry to enable the formulation of a range of healthier reduced sugar foods. 
This would help the food industry to contribute to the UK Government Calorie Reduction initiative, which is part of the Food Network-Responsibility deal and seeks to remove 100kcal/day/person from the food supply. The availability of tasty but healthy and lower energy foods and snacks has a role to play in fighting the trend of increasing obesity and type 2 diabetes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243944</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L025019/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>446B7E7F-04EB-4121-9CC6-9171277E00DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diet &amp; health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8EB9BB59-B7EF-4C3B-9170-233BADFF3D7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food structure/composition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
