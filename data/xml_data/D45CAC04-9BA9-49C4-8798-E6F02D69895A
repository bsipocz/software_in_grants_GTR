This mix of previously unexploited theory and concrete application leads to a project that is theoretically interesting, practically useful and timely in that it addresses a pressing problem in computer security.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>123921</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Security is a continuing source of concern with the use of computers and software.

One common error is code that allows buffers to overrun, that is, the program permits data to be written to a part of a memory which should really be forbidden. If a hacker can exploit such a memory access, then they might be able to launch a security attack. Such an attack is made by overwriting part of the program with a small program. One example of such a program is a &amp;quot;worm&amp;quot; that when executed not only erases precious work stored on the computer but often attacks other computers running the same buggy program. Since most computers today are connected via the Internet, it only takes a split second for a worm to attack other computers in the vicinity which in turn will attack many more. Worms like the MS Blaster Worm have incurred losses of hundreds of million of dollars to society by rendering computers unusable. Moreover, even those buffer overruns that cannot be exploited for malicious intent, still need to be tracked down because they are often symptomatic of errors or oversights introduced or made by the programmer.
