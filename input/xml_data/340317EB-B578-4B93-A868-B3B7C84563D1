Several species of trypanosome lead to disease in cattle and other livestock, resulting in loss of productivity for farmers. The disease is a huge economic burden in affected areas, leading to reduced life chances for families in rural Africa. One of these trypanosome species is able to infect humans and causes a lethal disease. Currently drug treatments are inefficient and toxic. The parasite acquires nutrients from their host, avoid killing by the host immune system and adapt to the different mammals they can infect. Through my research I would ultimately like to understand, and then interfere, with the way in which trypanosomes interact with their mammalian hosts.

If you look down a microscope at the blood from a trypanosome-infected mammal, you would see these single-celled parasites, swimming amongst the red blood cells. They do not hide from the host immune defences that are designed to prevent infections. Instead they have a specialised and highly adapted cell surface mostly composed of an important protein that allows them defend themselves against attack. However, their surface is not dedicated solely to defence. They must also communicate with one another and acquire nutrients for their growth without compromising their defence which requires other protein molecules. Exactly how this is achieved is not understood fully: do they hide the other important proteins at their surface or do they have very few on the surface at any one time? I will follow the position and movements of known nutrient receptors to answer these questions as well as measure how accessible these receptors. This work will primarily be carried out at the University of Cambridge (UK) but will also involve scientists based at the University of Oxford (UK) and the University of W&amp;uuml;rzburg (Germany).

Different trypansome species interact with their mammalian hosts in different ways and in the proposed research I aim to understand the molecular basis for this. I will compare the cell surface of multiple species: the similarities tells us the important factors required for trypanosomes to infect mammals in general; the differences allows us to understand the way these species evolved and why they cause distinct disease symptoms. 

Most trypanosome research focusses on laboratory grown strains that are different to the trypanosomes found in cattle in Africa today. My research will compare the differences between laboratory trypanosomes and those freshly isolated from cattle in Ghana in order to reveal aspects of the trypanosome biology that are important for infectivity in mammals that would otherwise not be identified using laboratory strains. This work would be in collaboration with researchers at the University of Ghana (Ghana) and would lead to a better understanding of the infectivity of trypanosomes in mammals and how that contributes to disease.

This work will begin to address long-term questions about the molecular biology and evolution of host-parasite interactions in African trypanosomes and how these affect their ability to infect and cause disease in mammals, such as humans and livestock.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The proposed research programme will aim to improve our understanding of the molecular basis and evolution of the host-parasite interface between African trypanosomes and their mammalian hosts, with a long-term view to improving quality of human life. This will be achieved by the molecular and biochemical characterisation of receptors on the trypanosome cell surface, their evolution and diversification between species, their expression during mammalian infection and their potential for exploitation.

The localisation and endocytosis of known trypanosome surface receptors will be analysed via high-resolution microscopy and flow cytometry in order to determine the dynamics of receptor-mediated uptake and the key mechanisms of immune evasion by invariant surface receptors. The binding sites of monoclonal antibodies targeting a trypanosome surface receptor will be determined. This will reveal information regarding the access of antibodies to surface proteins and the exposure of epitopes on the receptor surface.

Different African trypanosome species show distinct infection and cellular characteristics and cause different pathologies. To determine the molecular basis for the diversification of host-parasite interactions, the surface protein compositions of different trypanosome species will be assessed and species-specific surface proteins will be characterised for function. The ability of trypanosomes to adapt to their external environment will also be assessed through a transcriptome analysis of freshly isolated parasites in comparison to those that have been adapted to culture. 

This work will begin to address long-term questions about the molecular biology and evolution of host-pathogen interactions in African trypanosomes and their role in pathogenicity.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>As well as the direct academic benefit provided by the proposed research (as detailed in the academic beneficiaries section), there is also likely to be interest and benefit to those outside academia. 

Commercial private sector beneficiaries
The research outcomes of the proposed research have the potential to contribute to the longer term development of novel therapeutics against African trypanosomes by identifying novel genes that are required for infectivity and pathogenicity.
More directly, I am currently running a collaboration with a UK-based biotechnology company, looking to therapeutically exploit receptor-mediated uptake in African trypanosomes. Following the completion of this on-going work, and if it has proved successful, then within the duration of the proposed research I shall seek further collaboration. 

Policy-makers within international, national, local or devolved government, government agencies or regulators who would benefit from this research 
While considerable attention has been given to one species of African trypanosome, due to the ability of some isolates to infect humans, there are multiple African trypanosome species with distinct cellular infection characteristics. These parasites have evolved both with their mammalian hosts, but also with one another in their external environment. An understanding of the evolutionary divergence that has occurred between these species will, over the long-term, feed into our understanding of the relationships between these species and how they interact with their various mammalian hosts. This has potential to inform therapeutic treatments and drug regimes, particularly in contexts where the removal/elimination of one of these African species may incidentally affect the others. 

Beneficiaries within the wider public
The work carried out during this research proposal is ideally suited to science communication activities and events, allowing the general public to understand and engage with the research. This will involve contributing to events such as the annual University of Cambridge science festival.
I am highly experienced in science communication. I worked at the Glasgow Science Centre as a science communicator during my undergraduate studies. I was also a member of the University of Edinburgh Postgraduate Science Communication Team during my PhD, through which I participated in large number of science communication projects both in schools and with the general public. I also co-established a new science communication project for Cub and Brownie groups in Edinburgh. We devised the concept, designed the workshops, applied for and obtained funding, as well as managing and delivering the project. The research in this proposal, understanding how parasites interact with their host, is particularly suitable for presentation to non-scientific audiences.

Other 
Apart from the lead applicant, a postdoctoral researcher will be employed on this research programme. This scientist will be provided opportunities for their own scientific and career development through laboratory training, access to courses, mentoring, and attendance at conferences. It would be envisaged that they would then proceed to make their own contribution to science and society in the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-05-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1023537</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P010849/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73EF98E1-3FA8-46A0-BE46-00AE16C7D999</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Communication &amp; signalling</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BA89E2C-27FE-4553-819B-3CE27FC71EC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7135270D-AD00-45BB-B94D-B6516BADEB67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Parasitology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DDA3AC5B-B4B5-4323-988E-62B85A8966BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Receptors</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8717CFA9-D46B-41A5-8971-BF4431B68E29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Responses to environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
