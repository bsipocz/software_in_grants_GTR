One kind of action of seminal interest to policy-makers is criminal behaviour. In recent years, an exciting new direction in the study of crime has been the role of genetics, and particularly gene-environment interactions, in crime causation. However, most genetic studies lack compelling measures of social environments and, especially, people's exposure to social environments, and rarely assess the role of change and stability in exposure over time. No study as far as we are aware has linked both genetic and neurocognitive data to detailed longitudinal data on people's exposure to social environments. The proposed research addresses this shortcoming by designing an original genetic study, using the latest methods for DNA analysis, with links to the Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study (PADS+), an ongoing longitudinal study which has used innovative methods to study personal characteristics and exposure to social environments and already collected more than 10 years of detailed data spanning the period from pre-adolescence into young adulthood from a contemporary UK age cohort.

One main objective of this research is to bring together the most advanced methods from human genetic and social environmental research to study gene-environment interactions in the development of people's crime propensities and their involvement in acts of crime, bridging the gap between two very divergent perspectives on the causes of crime. In doing so, the study aspires to advance knowledge about which genetic and environmental factors are especially important for people's crime involvement, why they are important and, consequently, what policies and practices may be most efficacious in preventing people from developing crime propensities and committing acts of crime.

The first of these methods is the sequencing of genetic data to identify whether certain individuals carry genes of interest to criminologists, such as those associated with social, moral and emotional cognition, violent and impulsive behaviour, mental illness, and substance use and addiction. DNA sequencing technology is advancing rapidly and allowing for increasingly ambitious and affordable genotypic research, and the proposed study aims to capitalize on cutting-edge methods. 

The second method is the innovative combination of a small-area community survey and census data with a detailed space-time diary which PADS+ has used to collect data not only on participants' family and neighbourhood environments but all the places where they spend their time, including detailed data about what happens in those settings. Using this data, the study has already published ground-breaking research showing how key personal characteristics interact with exposure to different environments in determining people's crime involvement (e.g., Wikstr&amp;ouml;m et al. 2012). 

Using these two methods, the proposed study will be able explore the relationship between participants' genes and their development of specific neurocognitive abilities and crime propensities, against the backdrop of their exposure to different social environments and in relation to their self-reported and official crime involvement, as well as other relevant outcomes.

Key areas of impact include the advancement of knowledge about what features of social environments are particularly important for people's crime involvement, who may be vulnerable to those environments, and why. This can improve our understanding of how to best identify and support those who may be especially vulnerable.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Crime remains one of the most persistent, destructive and costly social problems societies face. The UK Peace Index 2013 estimates that crimes against households and individuals cost the UK &amp;pound;124 billion in 2012. This includes heavy expenditures by the criminal justice system and related social agencies, as well as material, physical and psychological costs to the victims of crime, but does not factor in many of the costs to those involved in crime, such as bleak life prospects and the spiralling impact on families, friends, neighbourhoods, and social institutions outside the criminal justice system. 

Criminal justice professionals are increasingly aware of the need to acquire more evidence-based knowledge about what causes crime as they struggle to identify effective ways to reduce it. Yet most studies report only weak results because they still focus either on the people who commit crime or the places crimes happen and overlook their interaction. As a consequence, the interventions they inform tend to assume a one-size-fits-all approach overestimating the causal potency of specific personal or environmental factors. 

Contributing to change in how the public, practitioners and academics approach the explanation and prevention of crime is a core aim of the proposed study, in conjunction with PADS+. It aims to do so by using more rigorous methods to better assess the explanation of crime as an interaction between people's biology and their environments, and its relevance for policy and practice.

At a general level, increasing recognition that crime is the outcome of an interaction between people and places opens up the possibilities for intervention from one to three directions - targeting the person, the place, or the intersection between people and places. The more we know about how people and places interact, the better we will understand which factors are important in most cases, and be able assess which are most important in specific cases, allowing us to idetify the most promising focus for both general and targeted interventions. Limited resources can then be allocated more efficiently, efficaciously, economically and ethically.

These advances in knowledge will benefit those who design and implement policies and public services which target individuals (e.g., medical and psychiatric professionals), places (e.g., social and environmental professionals) and systemic factors (e.g., crime prevention partnerships). They may also benefit legal professionals in better assessing criminal responsibility.

The proposed study has the specific potential to benefit public services and policies which improve people's health and quality of life by supporting their cognitive development. By situating our understanding of genetic influences on people's crime involvement against the foreground of their developmental and situational experiences, the proposed research has the potential to improve knowledge about the relative importance of genetic influences and hence the practicality of genetically-informed interventions, such as psychopharmacological approaches, of relevance to those working in medical and psychiatric industries. It also has the potential to improve our understanding of the roots of cognitive differences, including key developmental windows and sources of influence. This can help us better understand how to support general cognitive health, as well as identified deficits, with implications for child care, health care, education and social services. A better understanding of how the brain interprets and evaluates experiences can also help us better identify important environmental factors and how to best manipulate them, with implications for environmental design, situational crime prevention, and media enterprises (e.g., information campaigns).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>182569</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>PI Treiber gave a talk for the British Science Association Sci Screen event for Spectre.

The first aim has been met by applying an analytical approach to understanding the role of neurogenetic factors in crime causation. This has been accomplished through the preparation of publications and international conference papers exploring the role of neurogenetic factors in (1) the action decision making processes through which people come to see and choose crime as an option, and (2) the developmental processes through which they acquire relevant neurocognitive characteristics relating to their preferences, sensitivities, moral perceptions, and abilities and tendencies to form habits and deliberate. A key emphasis is placed on the distinction between content and machinery to better specify the source of individual differences and, subsequently, appropriate targets for research and intervention. The Principal Investigator has also been instrumental in the development of an international network of analytical criminologists and the organization of two collaborative workshops. Future aims are to further develop and refine this framework through theory testing.

The second aim has been met and ultimately exceeded in that the study was able to capitalize on technological advancements to collect more extensive genotypic data than originally planned. This data was collected for 97% of the PADS+ sample within the two-year study timeframe, making it possible to explore neurogenetic effects across the 14-year timeframe of PADS+ (and beyond as the study continues). This has been achieved at minimal cost. The most transformative element of the study is the fact that it has incorporated a genetic dimension in a study that holds unparalleled longitudinal data on young people's exposure to different social environments collected through a pioneering space-time budget method. This means that the study can analyse the interplay between genes and environments during development, and its relation to neurocognitive capacities and, ultimately, criminal behaviour, in greater depth than any previous study.

The final aim is now in the process of being met. The study benefited from piggy-backing on the PADS+ study and an opportunity to undertake more extensive genetic analysis, but as a result the final genetic data was only received at the end of the study (September 2016). Consequently, analyses are currently ongoing. The aims for the immediate future are to advance these analyses and disseminate the findings in academic publications and conferences, as well as through wider media, during the upcoming 12-24 months, and to continue dialogue with key research networks and crime prevention agencies such as the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Analyses are ongoing, therefore this cannot be answered at this time.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E3079D71-D064-4814-9F95-D983A8A73577</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d82d45e5fea7.19319639</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Commentary on the Home Office Modern Crime Prevention Strategy (2016)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD6F4996-5AE7-4B48-AF4E-70520747FF47</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d81e33b6ae52.55976004</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Meeting with Home Office representatives (June 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F8761542-A3BD-4D63-836E-0A44A41F2701</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d81dd3b630f3.33502148</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A dataset of SNP and VNTR polymorphisms for the participants of the Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study (PADS+).
