His work repeatedly engages with questions of power and his different films deal with the new world of work, the Republican school, its utopian capacities and hidden inequalities, and the asymmetrical power relations of tourism in a neo-colonial context. He has also taken part in various mobilisations by French film professionals in support of groups such as paperless migrants. He could thus be seen as a committed film-maker, but not one that necessarily follows earlier models. His working methods also suggest an awareness of the politics of the film-making process itself. Although he co-writes his films and sometimes adapts existing works, he also invites his often non-professional actors to participate in the elaboration of the script in a deliberate letting go of his own power. 

The research project aims to engage with these dimensions of Cantet's work, analysing the nature of the intervention he makes in debates around the social role of salaried labour and the French Republic's hidden exclusions and treatment of migrants and looking more broadly at his exploration of social groups and their power dynamics. The project will draw on the researcher's experience as a film studies scholar and his extensive knowledge of contemporary France. It will thus work at the intersection of French studies and film studies and constantly work to make productive connections between contextual knowledge, on the one hand, and the skills of close analysis, on the other. It will engage with works of sociology and social and political theory as and where this is relevant and productive. Examining the way Cantet questions his own directorial power, it will ask to what extent Cantet's work offers a new more egalitarian and dialogic mode of authorship. It will also use Cantet as a case study to ask how he renews our understanding of commitment in a period when leftist parties no longer frame and structure cultural resistances as they once did.

Because the research is interested in the politics of film-making, it will of necessity explore the circumstances surrounding the production of the films and their conditions of existence and circulation in a context where many low and medium budget films struggle for public visibility. At the same time, the research will consider the nature of the public impact of the films, looking at their reception history, but also looking at their capacity to structure public debate through the kind of post-projection discussions now so common in France. Again, the thrust here will be to ask broader questions about cinema's role in opening a space for public participation when other more traditional forums have become less available. 

The researcher has a strongly established expertise in French cinema and particularly in its political dimension. This research will therefore build on substantial earlier work, taking some of its key questions forward (about the need to redefine our understanding of political cinema for new times) but refining them by testing their application to a particularly interesting and significant individual case.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is not the kind of research that generates direct impact. Its primary value is in its contribution to academic scholarship. However, the investigator frequently presents films to public audiences and has at time participated in broader discussions around screenings. He will do the same with this research and will take all possible opportunities to bring elements of it to a wider public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>40330</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>17th February, 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F2DB9FE9-5280-4D09-8783-E5722B8A5C2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an invited talk at the Derby French Circle.

My work on Cantet follows this pattern, not least because Cantet's most successful film, The Class (2008), is on the new 'A' level syllabus for several boards. I did a workshop on the film for 'A' level students and their teachers as part of the Association for the Study of Modern and Contemporary France (ASMCF) outreach day on September 9th 2015. Feedback from the participants was very positive indeed. I have also made key insights from my research on the film available to a broader, international public by contributing an essay on the film to the H-France website, a site which gets approximately 10,000 hits per year. The essay, published in November 2015, can be found here: http://h-france.net/fffh/maybe-missed/3308/ . On Saturday February 4th 2017, I ran a Saturday school on Cantet at Nottingham's Broadway cinema: this involved a general introduction to the director's work, a screening of his film, The Class, and a very lively 30-minute post-film discussion. There were 40 attendees in a mixed audience of sixth-formers, teachers and the general public. On February 17th 2017, I did a public talk on Cantet's films for the Derby French Circle. About 25 people attended and the talk was followed by a lively discussion.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BF6EE10A-378D-4B01-A2AA-F7A8F575B74B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54635358adca77.62089075</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant allowed me to finish my work researching one of France's leading contemporary film-makers, Laurent Cantet. Apart from the intrinsic interest of his work, Cantet is significant because of how his films address current issues and cast light on contemporary political cinema, the strategies it adopts and the limits with which it has to deal. My work showed that, despite the wide range of themes addressed by Cantet's work, there are consistent underlying practices that give his work a real unity. He always explores power relations, particularly as they are worked out across the spaces of a film. He probes the relationships between individuals, groups and broader contexts and uses melodramatic moments of shame to drive underlying tensions to the surface. He questions utopias, both conservative and progressive. But he does these things in an investigative way, without imposing his own answers or indeed his own thematic concerns on the contexts he explores. Because his work is open in this way, it is able to open itself up to the voices of the amateur actors he so likes to use and the novelists he has chosen to adapt. What I hope to have shown in my research is that by so consistently probing power differentials and utopian possibilities and by developing an egalitarian directorial presence without ever imposing answers, Cantet provides one compelling model of what committed film-making might be at the current time. 

Within the broader umbrella of the AHRC 'Translating Cultures' project, my work on Cantet has drawn particular attention to how different voices, especially those from different cultural contexts or from minority groups, can be made to co-exist in a work without one voice subsuming or subordinating the others. I drew particularly on Bakhtin's concept of the polyphonic text to illuminate this aspect of my work. I suggest that it is partly the polyphonic nature of Cantet's films, and their exploration of the unresolved tension between the individual and collective that makes them so relevant to the current moment. More recently, I have drawn on the work of Jean-Luc Nancy and his notion of singular-plural selves to cast light on Cantet's exploration of the relationship between self, group and broader society in his films. I argue that in their refusal of self-contained individualism and social fusion, Cantet's films are both decidedly Nancean and of particular relevance to the current moment when neither radical individualism nor communitarianism seem to offer productive ways forward. 

I have also incorporated my work on Cantet into my broader exploration of cinematic responses to neo-liberalism, its modes of governance and the types of subjectivity it develops, whether in the workplace or in relation to debt. 

My work has been taken to a wider public through peer-reviewed articles, a book (Laurent Cantet, Manchester University Press, 2015), a book chapter, and other public engagements, both in the UK and abroad. It has a web presence as per the URL listed below and through the much frequented H-France website (see http://h-france.net/fffh/maybe-missed/3308/ ).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My work should help stimulate debate about contemporary French film, about the changing nature of political cinema more broadly, and about how film addresses some major current issues (debt, the changing world of work, neo-liberal governance and subjectivities, the tension between individualism and communitarianism).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AF4EB57A-72DC-434C-A685-CF93A063E3E0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463520fef2389.49994121</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://lafranceetlacrise.org/2013/09/16/film-and-debt-1-self-investment-evaluation-and-governance-in-the-work-of-laurent-cantet/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3BC684B2-DC03-4732-8CBA-3DD115ECF428</gtr:id><gtr:title>Thinking Contemporary Political Cinema with Cantet</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>South Central Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cb834509bba61185000b602c25c38a5f"><gtr:id>cb834509bba61185000b602c25c38a5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O'Shaughnessy M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bd7698864915.36151345</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BAA8D2E3-A6A9-4AF1-A251-BF446F90671C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Open Roads, Closed Borders: the Contemporary French-language Road Movie</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4ae698ef8efcc545ecf7df7e78f6b321"><gtr:id>4ae698ef8efcc545ecf7df7e78f6b321</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O'Shaughnessy, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1841506623</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>r_152484759991d0b16a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1687455C-F089-4563-B217-75BBC240F0A6</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Crisis before the Crisis: Reading Films by Laurent Cantet and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne Through the Lens of Debt</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>SubStance</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e62cf76292080646f5435575b70dbb50"><gtr:id>e62cf76292080646f5435575b70dbb50</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rachlin N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545e7a12a2d867.72008754</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E1DAA5A0-1C36-408D-8BB7-80AD387A6BFE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Laurent Cantet</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cb834509bba61185000b602c25c38a5f"><gtr:id>cb834509bba61185000b602c25c38a5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O'Shaughnessy M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780719091506</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56ab5858e82e11.39885491</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J008184/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
