genetic diseases characterised. This and a greater understanding of the infection process,
generates the need to detect larger numbers of targets such as pathogens and disease causing
genetic variants as rapidly as possible and in a single test.
One such approach commonly in use is real-time PCR and yet the application of this for
multiplex testing has been limited by inherent flaws in existing detection systems, cost of the
technology, and the time taken to generate results.
The design and manufacture of a rapid and low cost optical system capable of concurrently
analysing a large number of targets is the goal of this study. Such an approach would reduce
the cost of such testing, by allowing more targets to be screened in a single test and would
reduce the cost for uptake of the technology, as well as reducing the time to result to the point
it could be performed &amp;quot;while you wait&amp;quot;, for example at a doctors surgery.
Similarly this would allow novel PCR based techniques, previously impossible by
conventional real-time PCR. Examples could include forensics, by virtue of being able to
analyse more targets in a single run. This could also be applied to complex medical
diagnostics such as mixed infections.
The system would inherently also be many times faster than existing approaches, since it
could detect and deconvolute all visible wavelengths of light in a single reading as opposed to
having to switch between a series of filters which greatly increases the analysis time on
current instrumentation as well as reducing the number of analytes that can concurrently be
tested for.
In essence this proof of concept will use expertise in the field of satellite imaging and
mathematical modelling in conjunction with our Ultra-Rapid thermal cycling IP to solve the
problem of multiplex detection of labelled PCR targets and hence allow unique targeting of a
growing market niche.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98797</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710092</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
