Sequencing of the Culicoides sonorensis genome has been now initiated at IAH, in collaboration with TGAC and EBI, to decipher the molecular basis of Culicoides phenotypic variation. This opens up new areas of globally significant vector-biology research, including molecular studies of vector-pathogen-host interactions, to define genetic ?drivers? of vector competence and transmission. Genomic DNA (and RNA) from C. sonorensis colonies at IAH and the C. sonorensis ?KC? cell line, is being assessed using the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing platform. Our collaborators at EBI will provide the first annotated genome for any Culicoides spp., that together with insects from the IAH colonies, will allow us to investigate genetic factors and molecular processes involved in orbivirus transmission, replication and vector competence.
Analyses of genome-wide SNPs in multiple Culicoides spp and colony-insects bred for different traits will elucidate arthropod phylogenetic relationships and explore the underlying genetics of arthropod blood-feeding and immunology. Phenotypic differences within the colony at IAH, including sensitivity and permissive or non-permissive characteristics for virus infection/replication, will be related to genotype using current mapping strategies for identifying genetic loci involved in vector competence.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>640061</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This project was funded by a BBSRC responsive mode grant and was initiated on 1st February 2013. 

Culicoides biting midges inflict substantial economic damage on global livestock production and trade by acting as vectors of arboviral pathogens. The hypothesis that our project addresses is that genetic variation within species influences the vector competence of Culicoides for BTV strains and hence impacts upon the epidemiology of this virus worldwide. The primary deliverable of this project is the elucidation of the genetic basis of vector competence of C. sonorensis for bluetongue virus (BTV). It will also generate the first accurately annotated genome of a Culicoides species worldwide opening up vast opportunities for comparative genomics. This will provide fundamental insights into arbovirus: Culicoides systems that to date remain poorly characterised. The genome sequence will underpin advances in improving food security by protecting UK agriculture from potentially catastrophic exotic animal diseases. There is significant potential for this research to facilitate the development of new control strategies for these important animal diseases, with consequences for agricultural practice and food security, both in the UK and worldwide.

While the primary focus of the project is academic, a range of different groups will additionally benefit from the results, and we have formulated plans to engage them in the project. One of the principal approaches for the dissemination of the outputs for this project has been the production of animated videos funded by the &amp;quot;Excellence with Impact&amp;quot; competition. This novel approach of using animations to describe our work to a general audience goes above and beyond the intended scientific audience of the project. This has also been of interest to the Animal Health Industry who will benefit through the production by engaging with the public.
The animations have also been used in outreach activities to ensure that Farmers and Veterinarians benefit from the project, by gaining a deeper understanding of Culicoides and the pathogens they transmit. The high profile nature of the incursion of recent BTV-8 incursions has facilitated an opportunity to provide background information to farmers and veterinarians on what was until recently viewed as exotic pathogens of little relevance to the UK. We intend to build on this advance by further engagement across the veterinary and farming stakeholders, by detailing significant findings made during the project and how we intend to turn research into practice.
Finally, we will engage with the Schools who will have an interest in both the advanced nature of the techniques involved in the study (STEM) and the high profile of Culicoides as an insect vector group in the UK. We will exploit this unique opportunity through the animated videos to both promote the objectives of BBSRC and explore this area of science in an understandable fashion. Scientists employed during the project are encouraged to take part in public engagement. In addition, the entomology group has wide experience of outreach activities through a variety of events run primarily with the Royal Entomological Society and the animated videos will also be utilised for this engagement. Exhibit materials, including the animated videos, will be used in further outreach and in open days for The Pirbright Institute, TGAC and EBI. Finally, our laboratory is already involved in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) activities for schools. Dr Fife is an active STEM ambassador, which creates opportunities to inspire young people and develop their creativity, problem-solving and employability skills the UK's future competitiveness. All researchers will be encouraged to participate in STEM activities including school visits and career days.</gtr:description><gtr:id>58032110-93AE-4138-93BB-EF97147099F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This has been selected for the final of the BBSRC Excellence with Impact awards.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bde75299cd10.23544668</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Culicoides animations</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL - EBI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>EBI Culicoides genome project</gtr:description><gtr:id>7981DFE3-5020-4D93-BA5D-331AA7C0336A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication and public release of genome data for Culicoides genome project</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bdc8e04e4123.05929595-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Sequencing and genome build for Culicoides genome project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Performed experiments and provided material for Sequencing and genome build of the Culicoides genome project</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MF STEM3</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>35F9A97A-2B3E-4DBF-BEF6-8E8B10B768FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Students from Years 5-6 i.
