Cambridge University Press has agreed to publish this book, having considered my proposal and positive reports from three anonymised readers. This will be the first book to explore a wide range of women's political activity over these years in one volume. The book will explore a number of political movements in which women participated, focusing primarily on: philanthropy; women's education reform; local government reform movement; women's suffrage; socialism, and nationalist and unionist politics. It will examine these as individual political campaigns, as well as exploring how separate moments and organisations influenced one another through shared membership, aims and techniques. This is crucial as one of the aims of the study is to highlight co-operation across various organisations, despite the increasing political tension which characterised Ireland in this period. 

A key component of the book is its emphasis on the impact of early reform movements on all the women's political activism which followed. Not only did many of the women who campaigned for educational and philanthropic reform in the late nineteenth century subsequently become active in suffrage, nationalist and unionist politics, they also exported many of the skills they learned in their early campaigning years. These included pamphleteering, petitioning, fund raising and public speaking whose impact on the subsequent electoral success of both of Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists in particular have been under-estimated. The fact of Ireland's small population and limited numbers of political and social radicals and reformers meant that the women who did became involved in political campaigning tended to join many groups rather than one. This meant not only that they were able to transfer effectively the skills they learned in one organisation to others, it also meant that they became known to the relatively small numbers of similarly minded women. This encouraged loyalties and cooperation across political divisions and ensured that women tended to sustain cross-denominational and even cross-political activism in the interest of common causes much more successfully than their male counterparts who did not manage this at all. 
Ireland was fundamentally transformed and radicalised in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. These years are widely understood by Irish historians to have represented a revolutionary period when Irish politics became increasingly militarised and the country experienced reform, rebellion and ultimately, the end of the Union between Ireland and Great Britain. My research sheds new light on the involvement of women in these seminal events by highlighting not only how they contributed to broader nationalist and unionist campaigns, but also how they created particular variants of these ideologies, variants which were informed by women's particular experiences and orderings of political priorities. Thus, I show that while many women worked in an allegedly auxiliary capacity within and alongside the major political organisations, many also maintained campaigns within campaigns, most of them explicitly feminist in nature. They also, in many cases, challenged the male dominance of most political organisations more forcefully than has been allowed, even in the midst of the most serious constitutional crises of the period. My book will explore for the first time the multifaceted way that women engaged in Irish politics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, highlighting both the multiplicity of influences and loyalties which shaped their political views, and the way female activism shaped the broader movements in which women were involved.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As the first comprehensive study of women's political activity in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Ireland, this book will generate a great deal of interest beyond the academy, not only because the subject is of proven intrinsic interest to the Irish reading public, but also because it intersects with several remarkable social and political shifts in Irish society. My Very Short Introduction to Modern Ireland (OUP, 2004) covered two hundred years of Irish history, but the sections on women and social and political change generated by far the most discussion and debate among readers from a variety of backgrounds; this persuaded me that the kind of study I am currently working on would generate further general debate. 
The responses that I have received from potential publishers and readers confirms that the appeal of this book will be broader than is usual for an academic monograph. One of the main reasons for this is the heightened level of public discussion about the role of women in contemporary Irish society and the historical precedents for this. The most outstanding symbol of the recent shift in public perceptions of the status of women in Irish society was the election of Mary Robinson to the Irish presidency in 1990. Though popular, she is hardly representative of most Irish women who remain well represented in the membership of all the major political parties (about 40 per cent), but under-represented in national executives and in the D&amp;aacute;il. Robinson's election encouraged Irish commentators to begin to ask why this is so and also to question why some of the building blocks of the modern Irish state entrenched particular views about the role of women in the private and public spheres. Such analysis has become particularly acute in the context of recent debates about amendments to the Irish constitution. My work will offer a number of historical insights which will feed into this debate.

I have been asked to give a public lecture based on the reserch for this book at the National Library of Ireland. This lecture will almost certainly take place in early 2013 and like most lectures given in the Library, it will be open to the general public. Recent experience of similar events at the Library suggests that such a lecture will attract a broad section of Irish society. Much of my research was conducted in the National Library's archives and the Library's director is eager for my lecture to highlight these sources in order to encourage other researchers to consult the Library's considerable holdings in this area. We are currently discussing the feasibility of mounting an exhibition to coincide with my lecture and I very much hope that this will be possible as the National Library's exhibitions are free, open to the public and generally very well attended.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78721</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>I curated the Irish Digital Repository/Royal Irish Academy online exhibition, Inspiring Ireland: Women in the Easter Rising, and wrote the
