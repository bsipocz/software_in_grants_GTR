In cells from multicellular organisms, most of the genes are interrupted by large chunks of meaningless sequence, known as introns. These comprise on average 90% of the length of the genes. They are removed form the linear RNA molecule, in a process known as splicing. However, there are a few genes in which some of the encoding sequences are tandemly duplicated. These duplications appear to interfere with the signals in the linear code, and are probably a serious impediment to the biological function of the gene. It seems probable that they arise by a chance mis-direction of other cellular activities while the newly-made RNA is still closely associated with the gene. This raises some very interesting questions. How does the duplication happen? Why aren t all genes affected? Have most genes evolved in such a way as to prevent these reactions? By determining which sequences or features in a gene are required for the duplication reactions, and by investigating the nature of the reaction, we should be able to explain why it is restricted to only a few genes. On the way, we might discover some very interesting information about the ways in which RNA synthesis and the removal of the meaningless chunks are coupled.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Specific alleles of certain genes produce a significant proportion of their mRNA as isoforms containing tandemly repeated exons or groups of exons. This process is termed exon repetition. We have shown recently that it is determined in cis by specific alleles of the two best-studied genes, so that in heterozygotes the products of one allele contain repeated exons but those of the other do not, and it is not an essential process but may reduce the efficiency of gene expression. We postulate that exon repetition is produced by adventitious reactions that are generally selected against during genome evolution, i.e., that the avoidance of the conditions required for repetition is a driving force in gene sequences. We have demonstrated recently that the level of exon repetition is affected very strongly by the nature of the promoter driving expression from a transfected construct, and that the insertion of known pause sequences increases the level of repetition. The results are consistent with a model in which exon repetition is the product of trans-splicing reactions that are allele-specific because they take place during transcription while both RNA molecules are attached to elongating transcription complexes. We propose to test this model and to establish what factors promote exon repetition and therefore why most genes escape it.

Exon repetition has been characterised in most detail in the rat COT and Sa genes. Our objectives are (i) to identify pause sites for transcriptional elongation in the endogenous COT gene, using nuclear run-on assays; (ii) to test the functional importance of these sites in transfected COT genes; (iii) to investigate the mechanisms by which exogenous and any endogenous pause sites stimulate exon repetition; (iv) to analyse the contribution of the lengths and sequences of the first few exons and introns in transfected COT genes; (v) to test the roles of splicing signals in endogenous COT genes using complementary oligoribonucleotide derivatives and to investigate in vitro the striking inhibition of splicing by Sa exon 2; (vi) to investigate the role of the promoter and its connection with pausing, polymerase processivity and polymerase density; and (vii) to test the proposed trans-splicing mechanism by using 3C to determine whether two stretches of the endogenous gene are in close proximity as a result of RNA bridging by splicing intermediates between two molecules of RNA polymerase.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>186499</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk to clinicians</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>412E7E54-4028-4736-AA0F-AB45C5110742</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk to clinicians at Royal Society of Medicine as part of a day-long programme about splicing and clinical science
