groups in Britain face social and cultural barriers to participation in the public sphere. The lack of ethnic diversity in the British media involves a shortage of minority ethnic groups in mainstream journalism and newsroom management which corresponds with the misrepresentation and under representation of minority ethnic groups such as Blacks and Asians in national and regional news (Cottle 2000, Poole 2002; Poole and Richardson 2006). These issues are of growing concern to the media industry, media academics and minority ethnic communities themselves. As the industry undergoes substantial restructuring due to economic upheaval, technological revolution and deskilling, this situation may worsen without rigorous analysis and effective policy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the light of these problems, the seminar series addressed ways to increase the representation of Black and ethnic minority communities in mainstream newsrooms to raise their participation and profile in British civil society. The aim was to examine ways to rectify under representation of Black and minority ethnic communities in mainstream journalism, including media leadership roles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The series has provided a facilitative forum in which representatives of the mainstream and minority ethnic media industry, journalism education and relevant academic disciplines can collaborate to examine ways to increase the ethnic diversity of the media industries. It has assembled distinct perspectives and fostered interactions across the social, industrial, academic and educational landscape to create productive interdisciplinary propositions for future collaborations and schemes. Academic research will inform the development of policy and practice in Government, media industries and journalism education and training.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18031</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sunderland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Journalism Media &amp; Cultural Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>Widening Ethnic Diversity collaborations</gtr:description><gtr:id>C45EE792-91C8-4A78-A52D-5FF258A5FD9B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1. A book, featuring the best original papers, is being published in July 2012 as a special edition of the international journal Ethical Space (journal of Institute for Communication Ethics). The publication combines the final two quarterly editions of the journal. This journal publishes articles from professionals working in the communication industries as well scholars engaged in academic research. This approach ties in effectively with the ethos of the seminar series. The book is edited by the co-investigators, David Baines and Deborah Chambers.

Dr David Baines is researching a project by the charity Headliners which used the development of journalism skills in children and young people to bridge sectarian and ethnic divides in Northern Ireland. 
The young people, many of whom were disengaged and marginalised worked together across cultural and community fault-lines to explore issues of sectarianism, overcome engrained social, political and religious divisions and prejudices and to work towards the goal of a shared vision and future. (The project will be presented at the 'Conflict, Trauma and the Media Conference' Liverpool John Moores University, an interim paper will be delivered and has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of the triennial World Journalism Education Congress in July and a further abstract has been submitted for the European Communication Research and Education Association (ECREA)) conference in November in Prague) Further data collection is planned and the paper will be submitted to a journal (Journalism / Journalism Studies) in due course.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b552fd7ea386.05529279</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1. The series has brought together academics, journalism educators, post-graduate and post-doctoral researchers, senior executives and working journalists. It has generated discussions within and beyond the seminars between representatives from organisations such as the National Union of Journalists, Bectu, Skillset and the Society of Editors: the key policy-makers in the news media sector. The series has placed the issues higher up the policy agenda for these organisations. 
2. The series has enhanced the participation of 'lay' members of BEM community organisations, and of BEM organisations engaged with the media; and fostered debates in the academy and industry. 
3. The series has raised the issue on the media industry and academic agendas; engaged key industry actors with academic research in the field and developed relationships and networks which cross the industry-academic-community boundaries. 
4. A dedicated website on the seminar series has been established http://media.ncl.ac.uk/diversity/, which is being updated and developed over the next two years and will contain key information on the mentoring schemes, best practice, policy changes and publications arising from the series.
5. (as mentioned above) The series has highlighted areas of best practice exemplified by the increased incidence of mentoring schemes within industry sectors and across education/industry boundaries. The benefits of mentoring schemes were highlighted at the seminars. Diverse projects have since been developed by the National Union of Journalists; the Periodical Publishers Association training scheme; the School of Journalism, Lincoln University between current students and past students now employed in the broadcasting industry. Lessons learned regarding best practice will be a significant legacy of the seminars.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7E4E5427-8F2A-4AAC-9BFB-226053FB1F04</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cb263d154763.19238323</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The seminar feedback demonstrated that:

The seminar series has:
a) engaged more media professionals, academics, early-career researchers and BEM communities in this debate; 
b) raised the issue on the media industry and academic agendas; 
c) engaged key industry actors with academic research in the field and with minority communitie;
d) developed relationships and networks which cross the industry-academic-community boundaries, with the aim of facilitating more willingness by industry sectors to address and seek solutions to these issues. 
The series has foregrounded areas of best practice:
a) A key example of this is the increased incidence of mentoring schemes across education / industry boundaries. The benefits of mentoring schemes, highlighted at the seminars, have been established by the National Union of Journalists, the Periodical Publishers Association training scheme and School of Journalism at Lincoln University. The lessons learned from these projects with regard to best practice, disseminated through the seminars, will offer a significant legacy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. A mentoring scheme has been developed as a direct result of this seminar series between students at Newcastle, Sunderland, Cumbria, Teesside and Durham Universities and BBC North East &amp;amp; Cumbria Journalists as a pilot project with potential for national roll-out.
2. A further key initiative being developed, which has been advanced as a consequence of issues raised by the seminar series, entails a series of projects by the three organisations: the National Union of Journalists; the Periodical Publishers Association training scheme; and the School of Journalism, Lincoln University between its current students and past students now employed in the broadcasting industry. Lessons learned regarding best practice will be a significant legacy of the seminars.

3. The series has also impacted positively on the secondary education sector through a collaborative project between the University of the West of England, the BBC in Bristol and local schools to better engage children with news media as a career.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AB774E4F-1074-460D-957F-72175322A07A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cb28379e4228.06699367</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk/grants/RES-451-26-0770/outputs/read/09cdb8ec-2fff-4ac8-abcc-0192835744c8</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Programme of events with selection of speakers at the following university locations:
