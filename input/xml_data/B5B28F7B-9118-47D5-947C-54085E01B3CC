However, wheat not only provides calories, it is also a vital source of other nutrients including protein and minerals such as iron and zinc. Protein and mineral malnutrition affects over 30% of the world's population, so if we could improve the levels of nutrients in the grain of staple crops such as wheat, it could have a dramatic impact on the health and lives of people across the globe.

The nutrient content of wheat grain is intimately linked to the controlled death (senescence) of the plant. There is an important trade-off between prolonging the life of the plant to maximise yield, and ensuring that nutrients are released from dying parts of the plant (e.g. leaves) to the grain. Scientists have often studied the senescence of leaves and grain development separately. I hypothesize that if we understand the integrated process from the dying leaves to the developing grain we will be able to improve the amount of nutrients entering the grain, without reducing yield. I propose to improve our understanding of nutrient movement from the leaves into the grain, and its relationship with senescence, in three main ways. Firstly I will study the genes involved in these processes in plants with normal and reduced ability to move nutrients into their grain. This will identify which genes are key control points. Secondly I will explore where genes known to be involved in nutrient movement and senescence are active in the plant and what their functions are. Thirdly I will identify mutant plants which have altered rates of senescence and identify which genes are changed in these plants, to understand the senescence process in more detail. 

Currently very few genes have been identified in wheat to be important in controlling senescence and nutrient content. This project will identify several of the most important genes representing a step change in understanding which genes control senescence and nutrient content in wheat. This information will be useful to crop breeders and biotechnologists to improve the nutrient content of wheat grain without reducing the yield.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Grain filling in wheat depends upon the senescence of the vegetative parts of the plant to provide a large proportion of micronutrients and nitrogen found in the mature grain. Until recently there has been very little understanding of this process at the molecular level in wheat. The identification of the NAM-B1 transcription factor as a key regulator of senescence and nutrient remobilisation has given us an entry point into these complex processes. 

In this project I propose to further our mechanistic understanding of senescence and nutrient remobilisation via three complementary approaches. Firstly I will identify central regulators of senescence and nutrient remobilisation using gene-regulatory network analysis. This will use gene expression data from a time-course in multiple tissues in both wild type and NAM-B1 RNAi plants with delayed senescence and altered nutrient remobilisation. Secondly, I will characterise the function of genes downstream of NAM-B1 and other central regulatory genes identified by objective 1. I will study the phenotypes of knock-out mutants in the glasshouse and the field, characterise the expression patterns of these genes, and where appropriate the biochemical function of their proteins. Thirdly to understand the molecular basis of senescence in wheat in an agronomically relevant manner I will carry out a forward genetic screen of field-grown TILLING mutants to identify genes which result in early and late senescence.

Together these approaches will identify components of the complex gene network controlling senescence and nutrient remobilisation and begin to characterise key regulatory genes. This project will provide information to wheat breeders to enhance nutrient content and modify senescence to suit the growing conditions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project contributes to both the &amp;quot;Agriculture and food security&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bioscience for health&amp;quot; Strategic Priorities of the BBSRC and therefore to the BBSRC's commitment to the UK Global Food Security programme. The strong links between JIC and UK partners within the Wheat Improvement Strategic Programme (WISP) will facilitate the dissemination of my research within the UK wheat community (both commercial and academic). This research will benefit both public and private sector organisations involved in improving wheat crops. Among the private sector, these will include multinational biotechnology companies, wheat breeders and farmer-facing organisations such as the Home-Grown Cereals Authority and NIAB. These organisations will benefit from improved knowledge about the molecular relationship between nutrient content and senescence in wheat and new sequence information which can be used as markers for breeding. In the longer term these organisations will benefit from wheat varieties with improved yield without penalties in terms of nutrient content, particularly important for protein which is generally inversely correlated with yield. The ability to manipulate senescence will enable breeding of climate-change resilient wheat varieties adapted to give stable yields and grain quality in the future environment. 

Ultimately, these benefits will impact positively upon UK wheat production, which in turn will benefit a number of stakeholders down-stream of the breeding community. Increased yields would benefit the UK economy generally by enhancing UK food security, providing higher incomes to the farming community and the industry (mostly rural) that supports this sector. It would also provide price stability to UK consumers whilst enhancing the quality of diets, and therefore human health. 

This research will also benefit companies and national breeding programmes outside the UK for development of improved wheat varieties. This work has particular significance in the developing world where reducing micronutrient deficiencies to improve human health is an urgent priority according to the World Health Organisation. Protein and mineral malnutrition affect over 30% of the world's population and bio-fortification of staple foods such as wheat is one method to remedy this. We will engage with HarvestPlus to ensure that outputs of this research are quickly made available to this worldwide effort to improve nutritional status of staple crops. Likewise we will work with scientists at CIMMYT (International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement, Spanish acronym) to facilitate the incorporation of beneficial alleles into their germplasm. The host lab has strong links with both HarvestPlus and CIMMYT ensuring that the international impact of this work is realised.

Academics and researchers in many fields of plant research will also benefit from this research. Increased knowledge of senescence and nutrient remobilisation at the molecular level can be integrated with physiological understanding to maintain and improve yield and quality in the face of climate change. The data generated, particularly the time-course of gene expression, will be interesting to computational modellers and cereal genomicists working on improving the reference genome. These benefits will be felt in the academic community within the UK and abroad.

Additionally this project will provide an exciting training opportunity for me to extend my skills base in this highly interdisciplinary research. This research is expected to be of interest to the media and the public, and will generate opportunities for outreach with schools and farmers because wheat is an important staple food. I have a proven track record in outreach as evidenced by the Monogram and John Innes Foundation awards.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>298912</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Finding your Arabidopsis Gene in Wheat&quot;  at GARNet Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F6E86C67-9803-41C0-AA5C-E7EC6F2A5849</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organised and presented a workshop about &amp;quot;Finding your Arabidopsis Gene in Wheat&amp;quot; at the annual GARNet (UK Arabidopsis researchers) meeting.
