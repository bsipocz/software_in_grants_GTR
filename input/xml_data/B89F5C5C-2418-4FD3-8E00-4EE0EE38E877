The &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; microscopes I envisage with this project will be able to adapt in real time their imaging parameters with respect to the sample being imaged. This will allow, for example, to reduce the damage inflicted to living samples or to selectively image interesting regions, allowing them to be imaged faster or at higher resolution. Furthermore, via computational microscopy enhanced information can be inferred from raw images by running specialised software. There is a need of bespoke software to be designed and implemented, adapted to the novel techniques developed in CAIC. 

This project focuses on creating software for intelligent microscopes. The software development will be tightly integrated with the design of microscopes in CAIC, and with the work of the project partners, experts in applied mathematics, machine learning, biophysics and optics. Some of the instruments, such as light sheet microscopes, are able to generate huge amounts of data, on the order of terabytes for a single experiment. It is crucial that the software can cope with such large datasets and to do so in a reasonable amount of time. In order to achieve this goal, we will make extensive use of the High Performance Computing Centre in Cambridge, that provides high-throughput and GPU computing.
 
Another example of computational microscopy is the reconstruction of images with sub-pixel accuracy. One example is single molecule localisation microscopy, whose inventors were awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 2014. CAIC and partners are involved in several projects utilising this technique, and adapted solutions for visualisation, detection; localisation and tracking of single molecules are essential for their success. Finally, computational microscopy will be applied to fuse information of several multi-modal images. 

Software that can be used as stand-alone tools will be made available on CAIC's website and in software repositories. Several meetings will be organised, to communicate project results as well as to exchange ideas in the microscopy image analysis community. These meetings will take the form of workshops, trainings and software clubs. Graduate students will be involved in several sub-projects, to acquire hands-on experience in software development for microscopy image analysis.

Building on the experience of this project, the aim is to nucleate a sustainable research infrastructure for computational microscopy in Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's main aim is to set up a research infrastructure for sustainable computational microscopy in the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre (CAIC). The software developed in the framework of this project will enhance the cutting edge microscopes built by the researchers in CAIC. It will impact the work of the physicists in the centre as well as the work of our collaborators by offering new tools, better visualisation of the data, fast and robust software for the analysis of the acquired images. A protocol will be set up for the use of the High Performance Computing Centre (University of Cambridge) services for our software. Design and implementation will be performed in tight collaboration with physicists and engineers in the centre and with project partners, allowing efficient knowledge translation and iterative optimisation of results. Training in the use of the software will be organised alongside the already well-established training of microscope use.

Scientists and other users of CAIC (the centre is open not only to the entire University of Cambridge, but to all universities in UK as well as industry) will benefit from the integrated image acquisition and analysis solutions that this fellowship will enable. This integrated approach will open new avenues for finding better solutions to their open questions. The centre will act as a hub in a multi-disciplinary environment, promoting discussion and new ideas in microscopy imaging related research.

Through CDT projects, graduate students will be acquiring first hand experience in research software development. Their awareness of research software engineering as an essential component in modern research and a potential career path will be raised.

Software tools (those independent on specific hardware) will be made open source and free, publicly available through software repositories, to the benefit of international community.

A series of events, such as yearly workshops, software clubs and training will communicate the results of the project. Such events will contribute to building a diverse and powerful community further emphasising the importance of the role of research software engineers in today's scientific world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>450498</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R025398/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F78E4567-DD59-4364-9D1F-0A778996E941</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrumentation Eng. &amp; Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
