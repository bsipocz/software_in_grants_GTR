It will assess the non-economic and non-quantifiable value of the USUs to their graduates who do not proceed to military careers, to employers of graduates with USU experience, to undergraduate USU participants, to the universities hosting USUs, and to the Armed Forces.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will address two, linked, objectives.&amp;nbsp; One will assess the value of the military experience provided by USUs to the five different constituencies identified.&amp;nbsp; The other will inform conceptual debates about militarism. The research will take place across the UK. It will have impacts and be significant to research users within the defence and higher education sectors because it will inform future policy development and practice, and will open up to wider scrutiny hitherto unexplored and little-known aspects of the defence and higher education landscapes.&amp;nbsp; The research is important conceptually because it will extend current debates on theories of civil-military relations and militarism by looking at militarisation within higher education and the workplace.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will have impacts on two discrete groups of research users (see also Pathways to Impact).

1. The defence sector, via Ministry of Defence and the three Armed Forces. Although to outside observers the military establishment may appear as a monolithic entity, in fact it comprises distinct units with separate roles and functions. Within the Ministry of Defence, responsibility for funding and oversight of USUs lies within the office of the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff Personnel and Training, and the research team have established links with the individual responsible for USUs within that directorate. Within the three armed forces, named senior staff officers with whom the research team have established contact have responsibility for, respectively, the URNUs, OTCs and UASs. We also include here the Defence Academy UK via the Defence Technical Officer and Engineer Entry Scheme (DTOEES) which although not a USU (its graduates all proceed to military careers), constitutes an interested party with regard to research findings. 

Impact for this group will be facilitated by: participation in the project steering group (to which all the above have agreed), including opportunities for advising on the design and execution of data collection; on-going communication of research findings via the password protected section of the project website (which will provide project updates and steering group-related documents); provision of sector-specific and force-specific research briefings (written and oral) on project findings, as requested; and provision of independent research-based recommendations as requested on proposed policy and publicity initiatives as they relate to the public / civilian interface. 

2. The higher education sector, via sector-specific organisations and via the graduate careers advisory and recruitment community constitute the second group of users. Direct sector involvement will include the participation on the project steering group of the Deputy VC for Durham University (Prof Anthony Forster), the Chair of the Council of Military Education Committees (COMEC: Prof. Donald Ritchie) and Newcastle University Careers Service Director (Nick Keeley, a member of the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services). Wider engagement and impact will be achieved through communication of research findings (in print and web formats) directly to universities hosting USUs (via Vice-Chancellors offices in the first instance), and via key representative organisations within the sector (Universities UK, Guild HE, the Russell Group, the 1994 Group, and the Million+ group). We will also communicate research findings to the higher education funding councils for England, Scotland and Wales, the National Union of Students, and any other organisations as advised by our steering groups and sector contacts.

Impact for this group will be facilitated by: participation in the project steering group of select users and on-going communication to them of research findings; the provision of research result briefings focusing on sector concerns such as employability and graduate skills, circulated to the above users; provision of in-person briefings as required; and the provision of research-based recommendations on the management of USU-university relations as part of the reporting of project findings. 

Impact for both of the identified groups will be facilitated through an end of project event to be held in Newcastle in 2014. Steering group members, key employers and military personnel, as well as project participants will be invited to attend. It is planned that this event will be held at St Cuthbert's Keep, the UOTC centre in Newcastle, and will include the official launch of the project report as well as the opportunity for guests to meet with student officer cadets from the three USUs linked to Newcastle University.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>217029</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>presentation to East Midlands MEC</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5023AAB-C771-4A7A-A901-1B2A3A9F9D94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>talk provided opportunity to discuss project with other potential beneficiaries

Draft information from the survey of USU students has been forwarded to the RMC Sandhurst, and RAF College Cranwell, at their request, and copies of the book manuscript have also been provided to Sandhurst and Cranwell, at their request, as the analysis of the data has progressed. This has led to invitation so to present on our findings at both institutions. This has included general overview material as well as more specialist data, including for example a briefing paper on women and the OTC for RMC Sandhurst. Project members have also been invited to speak on the project findings at COMEC in 2013, 2014, and 2015, at an East Midlands MEC meeting in November 2014, and at a Sheffield MEC visit to RMC Sandhurst in July 2015. Conference papers have also been given on this work at the ASA 2014 and RGS-IBG 2014, and will be given at EISA 2015.

We have had several requests for additional copies of our key findings documents launched at an event in London in March 2015, and our book will be available to download form September 2015, allowing a wide range of end users to access our material.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D8EF6F70-94B8-404A-9D33-4C36AA95F3EF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545d0245722f63.69508815</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has provided significant in-depth analysis of reasons why students become members of the University Service Units, how these students view the importance of their participation once they enter the job market, how employers view the value of employing graduates who have been in these groups, how universities perceive these organisations and how the MoD understands the value of these units and their students.

Key findings include the significance USU students place on the generation of transferable skills from their participation, and how these feed into their graduate career preparation; the legacy of these skills and wider USU participation for graduates and how this suffuses into civil society more widely; the lack of awareness within both the university and employment sectors of the added value that USU participation can, or is perceived to, provide to students. 

Methodologically, this project has supported the importance of using a mixed methods approach to unpack the complexities of understanding how USU participation works for different constituencies. The survey data of almost 2000 current students offers a vast range of data that can be statistically analysed across a range of indicators. However, for analysis of the long-term legacy of USU participation detailed, semi-structured interviews provided the ability to unpick the ways in which graduates used their USU experiences, not only in the job market, but also within workplaces, and how this evolved not only through time but due to changing work environments or colleagues.

Surprisingly we found that universities and employers were much less aware of USUs than the MoD or students would assume, and our work has been of significance not only in identifying this gap but also in providing materials to universities to highlight the experiences that their students are able to gain through participation in USUs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work will be of significant use to the three UK armed forces, including their officer training colleges, to the MoD and UK government, to UK universities, and key UK graduate employers. As such our key findings document was launched to MoD, university, and other end user groups at a special launch event at RUSI in London, in March 2015. The data has the ability to illustrate the role and value of USU participation and as such will be of interest to these user groups. Much of the quantitative data collection is replicable and could form part of a longitudinal study should the armed forces, or other academics, wish to embark on this. Subsequent to the publication of our key findings, one of the project Co-I's has been invited to give a presentation on our work at the Army College, Sandhurst and further discussions are in progress to present our work at a similar event at the RAF College, Cranwell. 

Much of the key data, and our analysis is detailed in a forthcoming book on the project, due to be published by Ubiquity Press in September 2015. The book will also be available in electronic format to aid availability, especially as we recognise that our main end users are likely to be within the military, civil service, and higher education sectors, rather than being academic scholars. 

However, we are in the process of providing academic outputs. The following journal articles will be published in the coming months. The first paper will focus on the value of USU participation to students and will be targeted to a military studies journal. The second paper, analysing the hidden spaces of militarization that USU graduates perform in the workplace, will be targeted to a political geography journal. The third paper, details the role and place of USUs within the higher education transferable skills agenda, will be targeted to a higher education journal. The fourth paper will critique the sociological value of USUs to wider society and will be targeted to a sociology journal.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EC35AAFA-EBBF-4123-8AF0-136A75E241BE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545d03834f9b99.84758212</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and
