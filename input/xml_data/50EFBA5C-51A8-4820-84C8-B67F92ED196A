This project will explore the inclusion of cultural-specific sound in new electroacoustic music works (composition using technology to explore, create and perform sounds) by working collaboratively with Indian musicians and UK audiences for Indian music. Unlike traditional note-based instrumental music, which may engage with exotic musics through evocation, electroacoustic music can express exotic sound quotations literally, via audio sampling.
This research will examine the process of collecting and incorporating Indian cultural sounds originating from Indian musical instruments into two new electroacoustic music compositions. The project, coordinated and supported by Milapfest (the UK's National Indian Arts Trust) based at Liverpool Hope University, will enable interaction with world-renowned musicians to establish a unique collaborative experience investigating the perceptions and understanding of cultural sound (that is, sound experienced as culturally specific). Practice-led research (composition work) will question the openness of the electroacoustic music sound world through the borrowing of sounds from a culture different to my own cultural background and experience, and will be documented in the form of an online research blog and presented more formally in a new journal article. The musical output, testing a variety of methodologies, techniques and tools to disguise or emphasise cultural manifestation in electroacoustic music creation will build upon a discourse concerning the benefits, implications and issues of cultural sound use. Through these outputs, this research aims to address a current lack of contextual documentation on the now-frequent act of incorporating culturally unfamiliar sound into creative output. 
Public concert presentation of the new works will unite the usually separate worlds of Indian music and electroacoustic music, while audience perspectives will collate public reception of exotic sound via interviews and questionnaires. Research dissemination at the International Computer Music Conference (ICMC) and Electronic Music Studies Network conference (EMS) will encourage further scholarly interest in, and consideration of, creative uses of cultural sound, while exposing aspects of Indian music to a research field traditionally unacquainted with these practices. 
Further to this, creating an online sound archive from the Indian musical instrument recordings will establish a freely-accessible education and research resource appearing within Milapfest's online portal. Commissioning new electroacoustic music works making use of the sound archive will continue the research's influence and impact beyond the project's funded duration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research project proposes a unique collaboration between Liverpool Hope University and Milapfest (the UK's National Indian Arts Development Trust), currently based within the &amp;pound;6.5million newly developed Capstone building for music and creative practice. Establishing a two-way link between these two organisations and drawing upon Milapfest's non-academic expertise in Indian music will provide a number of long-term impacts, within and beyond the project's funded lifetime: 
(a) Increasing public engagement with the cultural sonic emblem: As an established practitioner of electroacoustic music, I have received over 120 performances both nationally and internationally. Accessing new audiences through Milapfest's performance platforms and my own international connections will facilitate greater and more diverse dissemination. Utilising performance opportunities at the Capstone theatre (Liverpool Hope), seating audiences sizes up to 280, will encourage local community members to consider the manifestation of traditional Indian music in new media. Milapfest's current monthly concert series 'Music for the Mind and Soul' attracts maximum capacity audiences from a wide range of communities including Indian, non-Indian musicians, academics, non-academics, and local community members from the Liverpool area. Hybridising the usually separate sound worlds of electroacoustic music and traditional Indian music will educate audiences in new and unknown musical activity from both cultural spheres achieving cultural enrichment.
(b) International and national partnerships: Working directly with Indian music performers will entail cross-fertilisation of knowledge. Compositional work with world-renowned performers Roopa Panesar (Sitar), Dr Rajeeb Chakraborty (Sarod) and Kousic Sen (Tabla) will forge international links between the University and global performance networks. International performances and research presentations will be pursued in India beyond the project's funded lifeime as a means of monitoring cross-cultural engagement and reception issues.
(c) Encouraging the electroacoustic music community to think differently about cultural sound emblems: Journal publications outlining the research project and resulting methodologies, concepts and cultural engagement will present new approaches, techniques and compositional styles within new literature to contextualise the practice-led research. Paper and music presentation at the annual Electronic Music Studies Network conference (EMS) and International Computer Music Conference (ICMC) will reach international audience members. Regularly updated research blogs will ensure the most current research and findings are available for both academic and public readers. 
(d) Wider impact: An online archive of Indian music sound and music will be established, contributing to an extensive and unrivaled sound library for scholarly research, compositional application and creative practice. This resource will enable the collaboration between Liverpool Hope and Milapfest to commission works from international composers wishing to make use of this archived resource and knowledge base. This will create opportunities for local and international composers of electroacoustic music to develop new works in response to this rich and under-explored cultural resource. New works produced from this venture will be produced and released on Milapfest's current CD label. The sound archive will additionally feature as an educational resource within Milapfest's online Indian music portal, benefiting school groups across the UK and India. This online information portal will widen exposure of Indian music instruments and will draw attention to Liverpool Hope University's activity in electroacoustic music practices and Indian music research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49679</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Javaari (2013) is a fixed media composition for loudspeaker diffusion. 
Programme note: Javaari is the term given to the bridge of the sitar where the melodic and sympathetic strings run and create the sound. The bridge is made traditionally of deer horn and is made in a certain shape, width, and length, while the surface is flat with a slight semi-circle bend. The term also refers to the unique buzzing tone produced by the sitar. This piece explores these fascinating timbres originating from this instrument and pays particular attention to the beautiful pitch bends that arch over and under like vocal melismas. The work is structured into four episodes, each exploring a different intensity of explicit cultural sound use - often the sitar material is in the fore and sometimes it recedes or pokes through intermittently. This acousmatic work is the first in a series of pieces composed in collaboration with Milapfest (The UK's leading Indian Arts Charitable Trust) based at Liverpool Hope University. This piece of research was conducted to examine the translation and transference of cultural sound to electroacoustic music.</gtr:description><gtr:id>289F6F9F-CCAE-4A02-B578-ED2F52434ED6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This piece has received multiple concert performances and has engaged wider audiences through the intercultural activity leading to its conception.

Programme note: In the same way that a shruti box or tampura provides the supporting drone for many Indian Classical music performances, my composition seeks to create a complementary line for the sarod material within the piece. Derived from recordings of sarod, sitar, veena, violin, tanpura, swarmandal and ghungroo ankle bells, New shruti forms a montage from all these sounds while exploring the possibilities of sound transformations common to electroacoustic music. In places New shruti goes beyond just a drone function - it aims to instigate, provoke, and energize the performer through three main sections (i) glitch and crackle (ii) pitch curves and (iii) minor slow section. Through creating this work I have discovered the beauty of both the timbres of Indian instrumental sounds, and also stylistic features commonly associated with the tradition and performance practice such as gamakas (pitch bends) and tihai rhythmic cadences. Interpreting and reworking these features into my own music language has brought me closer to a musical culture previously unknown and unfamiliar. This work composed in collaboration with Dr Rajeeb Chakraborty is the second of a series of works exploring the transference and translation of cultural sound use to the medium of electroacoustic music, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC).

Prior to this no such educational resource existed or was freely accessible. The website shows potential to grow and include further instruments, musical practices and styles. This website has become integrated into the activities of Milapfest (the UK's leading Indian arts development trust) and is this year being developed into an interactive mobile phone/tablet downloadable app, supported by HEIF funding.
Much needed documentation on the processes of integrated cultural sound material into new music has been published. A whole issue of Organised Sound journal (Cambridge University Press) was edited and curated by the PI (Dr Manuella Blackburn) as a key output to the research undertaken. This documentation included articles from other practitioners and theorists reaching across cultural boundaries when working with recorded sound. This output revealed the great increase of interest in working with cultural sound sources (including non-Western musical instruments) and addressed the need for greater discourse to be established for this niche practice to continue.
The research revealed unexpected findings associated with the differing contributions from Indian classical musicians and the role they played in the collection of data for the project. Aspects of performer origin, diaspora, geographic locations and performance styles had major impacts upon the sound recordings and data collection. Assessing differences amongst 28 instrumentalists became a focal point not anticipated at the start of the project. This has led to new research questions for future study regarding how the UK, as a home to many of these musicians, is conducive to a new 'brand' or playing style of Indian classical music. 
The research moved towards the area of 'performer as sound source' and several key findings were made regarding the collaborative nature of extracting sound from musicians suitable for use within compositional work and for an online educational sound archive (Instruments INDIA). The relationship between composer and sound source could be categorised into 'directional', 'explorative' and 'unstructured' as encountered after recording 28 different performers of Indian classical music. Within the 'give and take' of this intercultural collaboration, the research demonstrated the possibilities in exerting one's creative and personal compositional voice when considering cultural identities and nuances. 
The research activities solidified a working relationship with a non-academic organisation - Milapfest. The process of collaboration and overseeing project partner relations was key to the success and outcomes of the research.
The two new compositions, created as practice-based research, revealed the significant impact of studio techniques and software/ transformation processes on the retention and dismantling of cultural identity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research resulted in the creation of the Instruments INDIA website (http://www.milapfest.com/instruments-india/), which showcases Indian musical instrument sound recordings made as part of the project. These sounds along with context, images and performer profiles can form the basis of school workshops on Indian classical music delivered to learners in Key Stage 3 and 4 (and beyond). The National Curriculum for Music at key stage 3 and 4 importantly states the need for understanding a wide variety of musical traditions - pupils are expected to &amp;quot;understand musical structures, styles, genres and traditions and identify the expressive use of musical elements from a wide variety of music.&amp;quot; (Cited from the new Draft Updates for Music in the National Curriculum Key stage 3, from September 2013). Further to this, &amp;quot;The way we respond to music is determined to a large extent by our culture. We need to learn how and why music is different if we are to appreciate unfamiliar music&amp;quot; (cited from The Department for Education Key Concepts for Music website). 
The creation of two new electroacoustic music compositions featuring Indian classical music instruments have received multiple international performances (New York, Perth, Manchester, Liverpool) and one received an award (European Regional award, International Computer Music Association, 2013). These pieces have reached new audiences, communities and laypeople outside of academia and have contributed to cultural enrichment.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A2BE8546-E0D6-4C67-8692-1C6117138B46</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544ff9b91c8285.78866637</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://manuellablackburn.blogspot.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F1E4F54D-B777-4904-ADDB-CFD13D56427B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Instruments INDIA: A sound archive for educational and compositional use</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organised Sound</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c4695be6006d99922f09ab5f8e1bf020"><gtr:id>c4695be6006d99922f09ab5f8e1bf020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Blackburn M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433d4876686a3.19531821</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>41B8B46B-396E-4716-ACD7-7FF540D7CCC8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Instruments INDIA website</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>N/A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9353ccd48f6328c83360494b5f4d4fe5"><gtr:id>9353ccd48f6328c83360494b5f4d4fe5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Manuella Blackburn</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433d56a7cb665.59197700</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CAC71FA0-7115-4A73-9792-F2651B957955</gtr:id><gtr:title>Performer as sound source: interactions and mediations in the recording studio and in the field</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Electronic Music Studies Network Conference</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9353ccd48f6328c83360494b5f4d4fe5"><gtr:id>9353ccd48f6328c83360494b5f4d4fe5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Manuella Blackburn</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433f9df0693a6.49738127</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B73FE7EA-D816-4322-B581-4372DB419440</gtr:id><gtr:title>Javaari</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Computer Music Conference (ICMC 2013)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9353ccd48f6328c83360494b5f4d4fe5"><gtr:id>9353ccd48f6328c83360494b5f4d4fe5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Manuella Blackburn</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433d63ed97c00.91262713</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF2C4ED1-DACB-4092-B496-035AA25BD4F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Editorial</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organised Sound</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c4695be6006d99922f09ab5f8e1bf020"><gtr:id>c4695be6006d99922f09ab5f8e1bf020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Blackburn M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433d4f5c84992.96550408</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C6FE52D6-A504-4655-9F7F-8FF6FD8D212D</gtr:id><gtr:title>New Shruti for Sarod and electronics</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>N/A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9353ccd48f6328c83360494b5f4d4fe5"><gtr:id>9353ccd48f6328c83360494b5f4d4fe5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Manuella Blackburn</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433d6ebaa9194.13516955</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J005428/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A13304AD-8058-4333-86C7-DB798216A696</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Composition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
