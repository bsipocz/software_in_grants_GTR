The hardware and software authentication devices market is witnessing increasing growth in revenues (US$ 760 million by 2014). Companies integrating mobile OTP (One Time Password), OTP tokens and USB tokens into their networks decrease the risks of data breach and improve their overall security stance. As the authentication market evolves, organizations will look at purchasing advanced security technology that will protect their data and that of their clients by requiring a user to have multiple factors of identification before gaining access to a workstation or network device. This significantly reduces the possibility of theft and prevents the compromise of an entire system due to a compromised password.
 Delivering instant remote access is no longer just about remote employees. It?s about enabling customers to perform online transactions, mobile sales personnel to access ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) applications, outsourced call centers to share the customer database, and more. While ensuring reliable, instantaneous access is a must, so, too, is the need to guard against breaches and ensure continuous governance. In this business environment, strong authentication?using multiple factors to ensure users are indeed who they claim to be?is increasingly essential to reduce fraud. As they evaluate the alternatives, many organizations are opting to use SMS based authentication, which offers a mix of convenience and security that make it ideally suited to many usage scenarios. 
 IProve combines the security of two-factor authentication with the convenience and simplicity of mobile devices and SMS messages. IProve can present a number of significant benefits:
 ? Improved security. IProve delivers two-factor authentication that offers a number of security advantages over 
 basic user name and password access, helping provide a strong layer of protection for user access and identities. 
 ? Reduced security costs. Compared to hardware-based token approaches, IProve can provide both significant up 
 front savings?by reducing token purchases and distribution costs?and over the long term by streamlining 
 administration and eliminating the cost of replacing lost tokens. 
 ? Boost deployment opportunities. By eliminating tokens from the equation and relying instead on ubiquitous 
 mobile devices, IProve brings two-factor authentication to a range of arenas where it would have been 
 previously impractical? online banking, controlled access to valuable IP, e-learning education portals, 
 authenticating voice-based system access, healthcare sites.
 IProve offers numerous advantages and benefits. In addition, its lower costs and ubiquity make it an ideal complement to an organization?s existing security and authentication mechanisms. For many organizations, IProve can present a host of benefits to organizations looking to improve security while maximizing the productivity of end users and administrative staff.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">972185</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
