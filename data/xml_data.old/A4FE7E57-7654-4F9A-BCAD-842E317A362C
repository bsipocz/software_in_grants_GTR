These areas were chosen with the primary aim to demonstrate that end users/recipients of research related activities have benefited. In particular, eight areas of research within the College of Engineering and College of Science were awarded sums up to &amp;pound;4,000 each and the remaining funds were used centrally to fund staff, seminars, a mentoring/coaching programme and the development of early career researchers. The research areas include:
? Swansea Materials Research &amp;amp; Testing - public engagement and outreach
? NanoHealth - an impact review with industry
? Future Interaction Technology Lab - video clips of PhD students, researchers and research group
? Physics - raising public awareness of antihydrogen research
? Marine energy - profile and awareness raising activities
? Printing and Coating - profile and awareness raising activities
? Advanced Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies (ASTUTE) - company diagnostics
? Glaciology - visualizing Greenland

In line with the guidelines for PIA, Swansea University utilized several of the suggested activities including workshops/networking events, market assessments, engagement events, publication of promotional materials, training/mentoring and central support via the Planning &amp;amp; Strategic Projects Unit and Department of Research &amp;amp; Innovation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Under the Pathways to Impact Awards project, eight areas of research were supported and each research area produced strong outputs which used by others.
Furthermore, Pathways Impact Award has made a notable shift in the culture of Impact, where researchers involved recognised the importance of KT/impact activities. These activities have been shared as best practice across the institution to ensure that future research proposals to EPSRC and other RCUK bodies embed appropriate, fully resourced and creative KT/impact activities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BFDD98E3-339F-42EB-8926-BB5E31F83A53</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e14559b72128.43188364</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I500375/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
