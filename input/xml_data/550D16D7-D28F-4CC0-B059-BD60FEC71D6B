T2D results from a gradual death of ?eta-cells caused the metabolic stress associated with obesity. As a consequence, organs cannot uptake glucose and results in elevated glucose levels in the blood that triggers secondary complications and T2D. Recently, loss of pancreatic ?eta-cell?s identity was identified as a novel cause of T2D. In this case, however, pancreatic ?eta-cells do not undergo death, but adopt alternative cellular identity and discontinue biosynthesizing insulin. We previously identified a class of genes called microRNAs whose activity is increased in T2D and induces loss of ?eta-cell identity. Our research goal is to understand how the pancreatic beta-cells acquire their identity during embryogenesis and how it is lost in adult organism expose to metabolic derangements. We use molecular, biochemical and genetic manipulations to examine the consequences of activating or inactivating specific genes on the identity and function of ?eta-cells and overall glucose metabolism in mice. By targeting a cell that lost it?s identity, rather than one that underwent death, we hope that our research will lead to the development of original therapeutic strategies that would recovery the identity of pancreatic beta-cell?s in T2D patients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Pancreatic beta-cells are essential endocrine cellular units regulating peripheral glucose uptake via the biosynthesis and secretion of insulin. The progressive decline in pancreatic Beta-cell mass associated with obesity and insulin resistance underlies the rising prevalence of type-2 diabetes (T2D) worldwide. Recently, beta-cell dedifferentiation was revealed as a novel mechanism of insulin insufficiency in T2D. Dedifferentiated beta-cells do not undergo apoptosis, but loose the expression of insulin and other markers maintaining their function. The genomic reprogramming is such that dedifferentiated beta-cells regress to a primitive multipotent state and present reactivation of several progenitors markers (e.g. NGN3, c-MYC, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, SOX9) and can transdifferentiate into other islet endocrine cells. This indicates that the differentiation state of Beta-cells is not set in stone and suggest that genetic manipulation could be use to reprogram dedifferentiated cells into functional insulin-secreting cells in humans. Our previous work revealed that overexpression of miR-7 triggers dedifferentiation of beta-cells in T2D and represent a crucial pathological determinant in the etiology of T2D. The objectives of my research programme are the following:

1. To define the biological role of miRNAs in the differentiation of pancreatic Beta-cells during development.

2. To define the role of miRNAs in the dedifferentiation of pancreatic beta-cells in diabetes

This research program will provide a basis for potential development of novel miRNA targeting therapeutic strategies aimed at reprogramming endocrine cells into functional beta-cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1294030</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article news in ''The Pathologist''</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4581D88D-B680-4AD9-A96F-816319404431</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Pathologist published a small News on our work describing a novel biomarker for the diagnostic of Type 1 diabetes.
