This collaboration is multi-disciplinary, including economics (Banks, Park, Zhao, Yip), social epidemiology and psychology (Steptoe), policy science (Yip).

The collaboration has contributed to three major conference presentations, three journal papers, and a thesis. 

Based on advice from the ELSA PIs, the CHARLS life history questionnaire was designed and then fielded in 2014. This has been made public on June 1, 2016 via the CHARLS website.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57865d6846a1b8.47427976-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Steptoe and Banks (PI of ELSA) gave helpful advice and training to the CHARLS team on technical survey measurement issues related to data imputation, the design of survey questions to measure subjective well-being, and the design of a life history questionnaire. 

They also contributed to training activities in China, delivered lectures and discussed research proposals of Chinese participants, improved research capacity of junior faculty and aging researchers from throughout China. 

Through them, their networks and activities, UK social science academic researchers and policy analysts were made aware of the availability of high quality longitudinal survey data on aging in China. For example, CHARLS PI Yaohui Zhao was invited to present at the Launch Event for Wave 5 of the England Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), London, October 15, 2012, on CHARLS and on findings from this ESRC award, on the relationship between socioeconomic status and health and well being among elderlies in China and England. Steptoe also presented findings from this project at CLOSER (Cohort and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources) Symposium on Functioning well in later life: What is the evidence from longitudinal studies?, Institute of Education, London.

Banks also made a presentation to Chinese policy-makers on the ways in which ELSA research had impacted policy formulation in the UK.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Please note that the original PI for the grant was Albert Park of Oxford University. This was changed to Winnie Yip of Oxford University after Park moved to Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in August 2011. Park became a consultant on the project but continued to play the leadership role on the project. This change was approved by ESRC.

Yip has done prior work on inequalities and health and well being in China and was PI of a project funded by the National Science Foundation in the US, examining the effects of out migration on the health and wellbeing of the left behind elderly in rural China. During the life of this ESRC award, Yip contributed her knowledge and experience on the measurement of health, subjective well being especially as they apply to the Chinese elderly population. Also, Yip is an expert on China's health care system and she made significant contribution to CHARLS in the analysis and questionnaire design on areas related to health systems, including health insurance coverage, health services delivery, which can be used in the future to analyse how health system design may contribute to inequalities in health and well being of the older population in China. 

Yip played significant roles in training and capacity building, delivering lectures and reviewing proposals by junior faculty and students using CHARLS during her visits to Peking University.

Finally, Yip organised seminars and discussion groups at the University of Oxford which the UK and China researchers of this award participated in to discuss analyses, progress and to present to the larger audience at Oxford and around interested in issues of aging and more broadly, the use of longitudinal data.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute for Fiscal Studies</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CHARLS ELSA</gtr:description><gtr:id>FABD03F7-70C7-4514-AA47-2552E598FFE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A collaborative relationship was established between leading researchers working on high quality longitudinal studies of aging in China (CHARLS) and the UK (ELSA), which increased the scientific capacities of both surveys, especially CHARLS.
