PDBe is a founding member of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), which manages the PDB, the single global archive of biomacromolecular structure data. The other wwPDB partners are RCSB, PDBj and BMRB. PDBe has operated a deposition and annotation facility for PDB data since 1998. Over the years, PDBe has developed advanced tools and services for analysis of biomacromolecules (including unique tools such as PDBeFold, PDBePISA and PDBeMotif) and for delivery of PDB data to the user community. In addition, PDBe develops and maintains critical resources such as SIFTS (Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy and Sequences), a vital source of up-to-date cross-reference information to other biological data resources.

The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC; www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk) manages the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), the main archive for small-molecule crystal structure data. CSD contains structural data for organic and organometallic compounds obtained using single crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction methods or based on powder diffraction data. The archive was established in 1965 and now contains more than 600,000 structures of small molecules. In addition to archiving the small molecule structural data, CCDC has developed many tools for the analysis of these data.

The information available in the PDB archive is used by structural biologists and the wider biomedical community to understand the structures archived in the PDB, while CSD data amongst many other applications can be used by chemists and biochemists for automatic screening of natural molecules suitable as drug candidates. Recently, to improve the annotation and validation of small molecule information in the PDB, wwPDB has entered into a collaboration with CCDC. As part of this, CCDC has made a number of tools available to the wwPDB partners, including Mogul, which will be used for validation of small molecule geometry during deposition and annotation of PDB data. This will constitute a major improvement as analysis of ligand structures in the PDB has shown that the majority of ligand models can be improved. The structure validation pipeline, which includes Mogul and which will become a critical part of the new wwPDB Deposition and Annotation system (D&amp;amp;A), is being developed at PDBe.

The goal of the present project is to implement a web-services API that will provide access to biomacromolecular structure data and advanced analyses and annotations of those structures available from PDBe. Additionally, CCDC will develop infrastructure to allow access to small-molecule data in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) for those compounds that are present in the both the CSD and the PDB. This will facilitate real-time programmatic access to up-to-date information from PDBe databases and advanced tools and services, which will become available to any bioinformatics and structural-biology-workflow systems as well as individual programs. In addition, access to experimentally determined structures from the CSD will provide better quality starting models for ligands during the macromolecular structure determination process. This, in turn, will improve the quality of deposited ligand data in the PDB, benefitting chemoinformatics research and informing the structure-based design of new drugs.

In this project, we propose to develop a method to provide access to types of PDBe and CCDC data and information in an integrated framework:
1. PDB data from the PDBe database infrastructure
2. Advanced analysis and annotations on biomacromolecular assemblies
3. Ligand environment and 3D structural motifs data from PDBeMotif
4. Up-to-date cross-references for all PDB entries, taken from the SIFTS resource
5. Data-quality indicators for all PDB entries
6. Access to CSD data for molecules that are also in the PDB</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>PDBe (Protein Data Bank in Europe) has developed many unique and advanced tools and services such as PDBePISA, for prediction of biomacromolecular assemblies and analysis of interfaces, PDBeMotif, for access to structural ligand-binding information and 3D structural motifs, and SIFTS, for up-to-date cross-references to UniProt, CATH, SCOP, Pfam, InterPro, PubMed, NCBI taxonomy, GO, and IntEnz for all PDB entries. PDBe has also established resources specific for X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and cryo-Electron Microscopy (EM). PDBe is currently implementing the wwPDB validation pipelines for X-ray, NMR and EM data deposited to the PDB and EMDB archives. The proposed PDBe e-infrastructure will create a unique and unified web service API for accessing data and annotations from PDBe databases and its advanced services and tools.

The proposed PDBe e-infrastructure will create a unique and unified web service API for accessing data and annotations from PDBe databases and its advanced services and tools.

The new infrastructure will allow integration into the PDB of small molecule data from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) for all small molecules that are found in the PDB in complex with biomacromolecules. Comparing the structures of small molecules in isolation (CSD data) and bound to their biomacromolecular targets (PDB data) will improve our understanding of whether binding results in geometric strain, which in turn may help elucidate the mode of substrates and signaling molecules. Alternatively, it may aid design of improved inhibitors or antagonists with reduced strain and possibly tighter binding. Finally, such comparisons can help users to assess if any unusual geometry or conformation is likely to be of biological significance or more likely to be an artifact of the structure-determination protocol.

Structures of small molecules in the CSD are almost always of high quality and represent strain-free conformations due to the higher resolution and better observation-to-parameter ratios obtained with small-molecule crystals. Thus, the CSD is potentially a very valuable source of high-quality starting models for structural biologists, and more frequent use of these structures would result in better quality ligand data in the PDB. Currently, it is possible to freely request individual CSD structures if the user knows the CSD identification code, but there is no mechanism that allows external structure-based queries of CSD. The proposed e-infrastructure at CSD will allow wwPDB annotators to query the CSD for structures that are identical or very similar to newly deposited ligands in the PDB. In this way, representative coordinates from CSD can be incorporated into the wwPDB chemical component dictionary and distributed publicly


The web services will enable identification of high-quality starting models for use in structure building and refinement. The availability of structure-quality information will benefit developers of model-building and refinement software by identifying the most suitable starting models for ligands and biomacromolecules to use in the structure-determination process, be it by X-ray, NMR or EM. Programmatic access to annotations could also inform, for example, the interpretation of unexplained electron-density features in the active site of a protein, by providing information about all possible ligands found in a given protein environment. 

The e-infrastructure will allow PDBe to bring together relevant data (e.g. data related to a particular ligand or protein molecule) from distinct PDBe advanced tools and resources and integrate it to provide users with a single user interface showing all the available information.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>117674</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Structural bioinformatics training course</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C6CD498B-3F55-4311-A54C-AB9DD355FF60</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-organiser of and lecturer in this practical course, interacting with students and fellow instructors.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2f6b8460cc1.88027766</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/2016/structural-bioinformatics-2016</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CSHL course: X-Ray Methods in Structural Biology</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>46CEE1E3-78C5-4E04-8B84-909A6FA76CC1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited lecture as well as two practicals and discussions with students in the course and fellow course instructors.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2f523be40b6.25894734</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=c-crys&amp;year=16</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk: CCP4 Developers Meeting (2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B05D38E0-46C3-4023-8F37-6F0A20EAB6CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CCP4 developer meeting

PDBe also manages the global repository of 3D electron microscopy data, the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB). 

PDBe has developed many advanced tools for analysis of macromolecular structure data. In collaboration with the UniProt team, PDBe has also developed the SIFTS (Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy and Sequence) resource that provides up-to-date data on the biological context of the macromolecular structure information in the PDB by integrating information from other biomedical databases.
 
The PDBe REST API is designed to provide programmatic access to all information in the PDBe database. This includes information available in the PDB and EMDB archives, but also improved and value-added information such as assembly data from PISA, validation information from the wwPDB validation resource, and cross-reference information to other biomedical databases based on the SIFTS resource.

The API contains separate modules for PDB, EMDB, SIFTS, PISA and validation information with relevant calls aggregated in each module. This allows for easy integration of all macromolecular structure information into an application or workflow for analysis of biomedical information. The API also makes it possible to access structure-related information in manageable data blocks without having to read a large file or parse data that is not relevant.

A similar REST API developed by the Cambridge Crystallography Data Center (CCDC), provides coordinate data from the small molecule archive, the Cambridge Crystallographic Database (CSD), for molecules that are in common between PDB and CSD. Their coordinates will be integrated in the wwPDB Chemical Component Dictionary (CCD) and made publicly available via the PDB ftp archive.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The PDBe REST API is integrated in the PDBe production workflow and supports the redesigned PDB and EMDB entry pages. The REST API has recently been integrated in Jmol/JSmol, a 3D macromolecular visualisation applet, where it is used to show value-added annotations on structure and sequence domain annotation and validation-related information, making it available to all data resources that use Jmol/JSmol to provide interactive 3-D representation of the macromolecules.

The CCDC team has developed a webservice to provide access to CSD molecule data for small molecules found in the PDB. To keep this information up-to-date the webservice is made available to the wwPDB partners so it can be integrated in the wwPDB deposition and annotation system. The coordinate data for existing compounds is also made available to the wwPDB partners so it can be made available via wwPDB ftp site.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>844B1749-DE1A-42F8-984D-043DF74DA3A8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5459169de8bec0.24229609</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/doc/api-index.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>CCDC API for obtaining CSD coordinate data for molecules in the PDB</gtr:description><gtr:id>B1A60C26-4EC2-474E-A59D-CE753672149D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A server which will be used by the wwPDB annotation system to update CSD coordinates for existing entries as well as adding coordinates for new molecules.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460815e15c344.69828974</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>CCDC API</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://api.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/crestano</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>REST API for all PDBe information</gtr:description><gtr:id>B7C6DA8D-8EBF-40B3-AA0A-94A3DF139378</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The API makes all PDB and EMDB data as well as value added information from PISA, SIFTS and validation data available.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546081cc764247.17452485</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>PDBe RESt API</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/doc/api-index.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0CCE20FC-2D96-43F2-BEB4-DE0D3C7263AD</gtr:id><gtr:title>PDBe: Protein Data Bank in Europe.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f795ed6635d33ec0e0a063ee325254bc"><gtr:id>f795ed6635d33ec0e0a063ee325254bc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gutmanas A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5458faaab9a362.97538067</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>41C78205-8614-4DA1-BF4E-1E3C8BBD0746</gtr:id><gtr:title>PDBe: towards reusable data delivery infrastructure at protein data bank in Europe.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7766e95f002b4ad8467a3804819114ac"><gtr:id>7766e95f002b4ad8467a3804819114ac</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mir S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a6f1361b2c191.63864992</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>35DD82C6-D0DF-4251-90B5-D1A17C347688</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of structural bioinformatics resources in the era of integrative structural biology.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta crystallographica.
