impede or prevent essential activities such as drinking and eating. Current therapies for PD
are unsatisfactory with significant side-effects and eventual loss of efficacy.
Our novel concept is for a wearable device for stabilising hand tremors. (Working name ?
?GyroGlove?). The device is based on a miniature gyroscope attached to the back of the hand.
Gyroscopes are routinely used to stabilise objects (in navigation, cameras etc) but have never
been applied to people. Significant progress has already been made. Our initial experiments in
test rigs and with PD patients have demonstrated that the amplitude of hand tremors can be
reduced by 70%. This is enough to make the difference as to whether someone is able to look
after themselves without assistance. The concept won the F Factor competition (largest tech
challenge in the EU), and was a finalist in OneStart (largest biotech business challenge
globally). We were featured as one of 15 millennial trailblazers by Telef&amp;oacute;nica?s Digital
Futures.
The concept was invented in 2014 by a medical student at Imperial College. Since this time a
team from Imperial College has been working on the idea and putting in place a network of
advisors and mentors. These include the National Clinical Director for Innovation at NHS
England, professors of engineering and musculoskeletal biodynamics at Imperial College and
leading biotech entrepreneurs. Additionally, major charities such as The Cure Parkinson?s
Trust and Parkinson?s UK have been involved. We have funded the work to date via awards
and competitions but we now need to commence a more intensive phase of work.
The engineering design of GyroGlove is the subject of a patent we have filed in the UK and
internationally.
The Smart funding will take the concept forward via design activities, a series of prototypes
and patient trials at Charing Cross Hospital.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99632</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710805</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
