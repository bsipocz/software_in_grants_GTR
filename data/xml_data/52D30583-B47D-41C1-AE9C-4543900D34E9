We are the world's No.1 in sales of TV format shows. Domestically the multichannel sector contributes &amp;pound;4.2 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) to the UK economy through expenditure in employment, advertising and marketing, distribution and support services, as well as content investment&amp;quot; (House of Lords, 2013). The United Kingdom has become an internationally-leading base for companies broadcasting and providing communications services abroad. This was made possible through European legislation which liberalised cross-border broadcasting and other services e.g. the on-demand downloading of films and other programming via satellite, broadband and the internet. With the end to roaming charges by 2017, these services will be increasingly downloaded via mobile phones. Hundreds of companies have located in the UK to take advantage of a liberal and stable regulatory environment for operation. 

The well-known company, Sky, relocated to the UK from Luxembourg in 1990. Sky now broadcasts to the UK, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria with over 20 million customers and &amp;pound;11 billion in tax revenue. Another large company, the Modern Times Group (MTG), broadcasts 60 channels in 36 countries from the UK. A third company, MTG, is the largest commercial operator broadcasting in Scandinavia and the Baltics, and has broadcasting operations in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia and the Ukraine. The UK-based group, Central European Media Enterprises Ltd (CME), broadcasts 34 commercial, subscription and on-demand channels to approximately 50 million viewers throughout Central and Eastern Europe including Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.

Today, the UK regulatory body, OFCOM, licenses 1577 television for channels broadcasting across Europe. Companies owninghese channels include: Box, Discovery, CBN, Al Jazeera, CBS, AXN, Black Entertainment, Mushroom TV, CSC, ABS, Penny Street, Viacom, Paramount, Coral racing, AETN, Disney, Sparrowhawk, DM Digital, Filmbox, 4 Ventures, E Enterntainment, ESPAN, Eternal World, Playboy, Zonemedia, Millenium, Lightdragon, Baltic Media, CSC, RHF, Fox, Freesat, Coloured Rocks, GEO Tv, AETN, HITV, Zonemedia, JimJam, Sparrowhawk, MTV, Dolphin, NGC, Nikelodeon, STV, Polsat, Sky, Turner, Viasat. Further on-demand services are licensed by the UK regulatory body, ATVOD. 

If the UK were to withdraw from the EU but become a member of the EFTA these companies could still broadcast to Europe from the UK under the EEA's Single Market agreement. However, the UK would no longer be participant to Brussels' decision-making. This raises the questions: what effect would a UK exit have on EU decision-making? What subsequent effect would this have on the UK market? The project research is interested in whether changes to communications policy at the European level which might affect UK interests and how UK-based stakeholders might change their preferences accordingly. 

The key question of the project is: What effect could withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (EU) have on the UK's communications sector? Over a period of one year, the PI will consult stakeholders and provide forums for scenarios building exercises on the effect of a UK exit on the communications sector. This will be done through an online questionnaire of key stakeholders, 2 symposiums, and 10 policy briefing papers as well as communication with the media and other public platforms. The project will concentrate on current proposals for revisions to the proposed Audiovisual Media Services Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation which deal with cross-border broadcasting and privacy/data protection respectively. In this way, evidence-based scenarios are aimed at improving public discourse.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study is relevant to industry stakeholders and policy makers at UK and EU levels who work within the field of communications policy as well as third sector actors and wider citizen audiences. The project will assist users in learning how policy options came into being at the European Union level and what effect this has on their domestic operations. In particular, it will explore UK-based preferences within current initiatives at the EU level in the context of EU decision-making processes. 

The outcomes of the research will be of particular interest to the stakeholders under investigation. It will enable them to gain a richer understanding of their role and significance as proposers of policy options in the EU communications environment. The project will provide them with comprehensible, relevant policy analyses to understand the way in which they can form preferences on whether they wish the UK to exit or remain in the EU. A particularly significant impact of the project will be the facility it will assist these stakeholders in learning about how European Union single-market policy-making is conducted and implemented in EU as opposed to EEA states. 

The project outcomes are also likely to widen the knowledge set of stakeholders with an interest in cross-border broadcasting and data protection policies respectively. The findings will also inform UK policy officials about stakeholder preferences through engagement with the regulatory bodies responsible for EU and UK communications policies. This knowledge will impact on other regulatory bodies in the broad communications and media environment which employ or are interested in UK exit in some form. 

In a similar way to the stakeholders which are the focus of the project's investigation, these regulatory authorities can learn about stakeholder preferences in relation to UK exit and/or renegotiation, allowing them in the process to reflect on their own ways of working. The project will also be relevant to regulatory bodies outside the communications sector considering UK exit, which will have access to the briefing papers produced for the project engagement events and published on the project's website, which would be unearthed through a standard web search by parties who are unfamiliar with developments in communications regulation but are interested in the effect of a possible exit on UK markets as a whole.

The project's findings will have an impact on a range of corporate business, private and public sector, regulators, and civil society interests and their representative bodies, in the specific areas of communications policy under investigation in the project. The website, in a 'user friendly' way, will allow users to gain a greater appreciation of the nature, work and broader significance of the regulatory and decision-making bodies in which they participate or to whom they are subject.

The project's findings will provide stakeholders and policy-makers the opportunity to consider alternatives in decision-making through policy modelling. The findings will be revised into 2 final policy briefings will discuss the implications of these scenarios for the UK/EU relationship in this policy area for dissemination on the Knowledge Forum and other outlets.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>110011</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>19 January 2016 - Conference 'British media, EU Membership and Referendum',  The Shard, London.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>374677BA-20A2-4EB4-B11E-A7C5AA59AA48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event was mainly aimed at fellow academics with some media, third sector and think tank participants.

June 21, 2016.
Friend's House, London.
This workshop was run as part of the research project 'The UK Communication Industries:
the impact of a proposed UK Brexit from the EU' led by the University of Exeter, which is
funded by the 'UK in a Changing Europe' Initiative based at King's College London. It was
the second of two workshops analysing stakeholder views in the communications sector. The
objective of the workshop was to assess practitioner and stakeholder views on what works
well and what needs to be addressed in the sector of cross-border data handling. This was in
the context of current changes in the market, EU regulation and a possible Brexit.
Stakeholders were able to share their understandings of the sector's environment and
establish mutual interpretations of what possible future scenarios meant to them. This enabled
them to take better control of their own reactions to changes in the future and reduce the
surprise element of future events with mutual understandings of different options.
A key finding was that Brexit would have a significant effect on companies' ability to
function within the UK. This effect outweighed looser controls affecting company behaviour
such as technological innovation and globalisation. This is because legislation on data
protection and e-commerce came into effect at the European level before or at the same time
as at the national level i.e. the EU has taken a lead in this regulatory sphere and EU regulation
has acted as a sizeable control on company behaviour. The effect of a possible Brexit is
sufficient enough that companies are considering contingency plans to switch activity to other
EU Member States.
The workshop was prefaced by the provision of a 4,000 word policy briefing authored by
Alison Harcourt and Lilian Edwards on current changes to EU regulation and summarised
views of UK-based stakeholders which was sent out to stakeholders prior to the workshop.
The workshop began with an introduction on different Brexit scenarios by Damian Chalmers,
London School of Economics, followed by a PESTLE / SWOT Analysis by 31 stakeholders
from the sector to identify key issues. The SWOT analysis was led by John Howell from the
consultancy JH&amp;amp;Co with a prioritisation exercise conducted throughout the morning. Six
aspects of cross-border data handling were assessed: political forces; economic factors; sociocultural
factors; technological factors; legal factors; and environmental impacts (PESTLE),
under which industry stakeholders prioritised variables. Stakeholders identified Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) matrices for each aspect, which are outlined
below. Strengths and weaknesses focussed on current conditions imposed by EU regulation
and the UK market. Opportunities and threats centred on future scenarios with Brexit as the
key variable.
Stakeholders spent time at each table building up the SWOT analysis for each of the 6 aspects
of cross-border data handling. Each indicated factors they considered most important for each
category. A representative for each category then discussed these priority factors in more
detail. The list below summarises strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats across
different categories as indicated. Each table was managed by academic / consultant
participants, namely: Alison Harcourt (University of Exeter) for the politics table, Richard
Collins (City University London) for the economics table, Judith Townend (Institute of
Advanced Legal Studies, IALS) for the social table, Elizabeth Lomas (UCL) for the
technology table, Lilian Edwards for the legal table (University of Strathclyde) and John
Howell and David Artingstall (JH&amp;amp;Co) for the environmental table. 
The greatest current strength identified by stakeholders was the market access EU
membership provides to the UK which allows for economies of scale. The most significant
weaknesses identified were low levels of public understanding of data use and of national and
EU regulation covering its use. Scenario building for a Brexit scenario saw some
opportunities in the UK's possible role as a springboard for European companies operating in
India and China. Economic instability was seen as the gravest threat to company operation in
the case of a Brexit. Other threats prioritised were: negative effects Brexit could have on
investment and capital flight, the loss of influence on EU policy development and a drying up
of the UK recruitment pool in the IT and creative skills sector. Most stakeholders at the
workshop pointed to potential job losses in subsectors due to a number of factors affecting a
post-Brexit market. Another key concern was a possible fragmentation of data jurisdictions
and future restraints on data transfer out of the EU which would be detrimental to a data
economy.

May 13,
2016. Friend's House, London.
This workshop was run as part of the research project 'The UK Communication Industries:
the impact of a proposed UK Brexit from the EU' led by the University of Exeter, which is
funded by the 'UK in a Changing Europe' Initiative based at King's College London. It was
the first of two workshops analysing stakeholder views in the communications sector. The
objective of the workshop was to assess practitioner and stakeholder views on what works
well and what needs to be addressed in the sector of cross-border broadcasting. This was in
the context of current changes in the market and regulation and a possible Brexit.
Stakeholders were able to share their understandings of the sector's environment and
establish mutual interpretations of what possible future scenarios meant to them. This enabled
them to take better control of their own reactions to changes in the future and reduce the
surprise element of future events with mutual understandings of different options.
A key finding was that looser controls affecting company behaviour (including product
markets, globalisation and technological innovation) had a sizeable effect on company
behaviour in addition to regulation. However, EU regulation would have a significant effect
on companies' ability to function within the UK. It is clear that a possible Brexit would
impact directly or indirectly on all of the above factors. The effect is sufficient enough that
companies are considering contingency plans to switch substantial activity to another EU
Member State.
The greatest current strengths identified for the UK focused on regulation, EU policy
management and market borders. Strengths highlighted for various political, economic,
socio-cultural, technological, legal, and environmental factors ('PESTLE') included: UK
talents and skills, and a sound intellectual property environment. The most significant current
UK weakness was uncertainty over Brexit. This was attributed to legal uncertainty, declines
in investment and loss of UK influence on EU policy-making. Online licensing in the case of
a Brexit was also regarded as a grave threat to company operation. Scenario building for a
Brexit scenario saw some opportunity in loosening UK regulatory mechanisms on a 'right to
be forgotten' as applied to new media services. It was noted that Brexit might trigger change
in EU-alliances with other discontented Member States. It also could bring about a return to
the Council of Europe rules (Conventions) for broadcasting policy making, shifting the forum
for Europe-wide agreement. However, the majority view was that Brexit would have an
unfavourable effect on the UK with negative effects on investment, capital flight with
departure of some broadcasters to other EU Member States. Most stakeholders at the
workshop pointed to potential job losses due to a number of factors affecting a post-Brexit
market. The EU was seen as a significant regulatory forum which would affect the UK,
whether the UK remained or left.
The workshop was prefaced by the provision of three policy briefings authored by Alison
Harcourt on current changes in the market, EU regulation and a possible Brexit which were
sent out to stakeholders prior to the workshop. There was an introduction on different Brexit
scenarios by Catherine Barnard, University of Cambridge, followed by a PESTLE / SWOT
Analysis. The SWOT analysis was led by John Howell from the consultancy JH&amp;amp;Co with a
prioritisation exercise conducted through the day. Six aspects of cross-border broadcasting
were assessed: political forces; economic factors; socio-cultural factors; technological
factors; legal factors; and environmental impacts (PESTLE), under which industry
stakeholders prioritised variables. Stakeholders identified Strengths, Weaknesses, 
Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) matrices for each aspect, which are outlined below.
Strengths and weaknesses focussed on current conditions in the UK market. Opportunities
and threats centred on future scenarios considering both internal and external variables.
Participants spent time at each table building up the SWOT analysis for each of the 6 aspects
of cross-border broadcasting services. Each indicated factors they considered most important
for each category. A representative for each category then discussed these priority factors in
more detail. The list below summarises strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
across different categories as indicated. Each table was managed by academic / consultant

social table, Maria Michalis (University of Westminster) for the technology table, Judith
Townend (Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, IALS) for the legal table and
Christina Angelopoulos (IALS) for the environmental table.

A conference on 24 May 2016, convened by myself and the University of East Anglia's (UEA) Prof Hussein Kassim. Figures from the campaign groups, as well as leading experts from law, the media, and academia, sought to investigate the impact of EU regulation not only on business, but more broadly on agriculture, employment, the environment and social policy. Among the key questions addressed were:

What are the costs of EU rules? Do the benefits outweigh the costs for business, consumers and other groups?
Would Brexit free the UK from EU regulation?
What would be the impact of Brexit for EU businesses?
The first panel, chaired by Allie Renison, head of EU and Trade Policy at the Institute of Directors, saw the CBI's Andy Bagnall highlight what he considered the overwhelming benefits of the EU to business, and pointed to the 95 per cent of the CBI member that supported remaining in the EU.

Richard Patient, the London chairman of Business for Britain, took a contrary view. He focused on what he considered to the damaging impact of EU regulation on small businesses, and spoke against what he sees as the EU's one-size-fits-all approach.

Piet Eeckhout, professor of EU Law at University College London (UCL), commented on the UK's influence on EU regulation and discussed how EU rules have become global standards in some areas. He also raised the issue of 'gold-plating' by the UK. To watch the panel, click here.

The single market was the focus of the second panel, chaired by John Fingleton of Fingleton Associates, and a former chief executive OFT and chair of the Irish Competition Authority.

Prof Kai-Uwe Kuhn, professor of economics at UEA's Centre for Competition Policy (CCP) and a former chief economist at the European Commission, underlined the benefits of EU competition policy to business, notably in providing a single set of rules. UEA Prof Catherine Waddams, professor of regulation and also a member of the CCP, discussed EU regulation in the utilities, arguing that consumers probably faced lower prices as a result.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b94aef96e105.67738979</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/media-room/eu-referendum/the-eu-and-the-uk-the-wrong-kind-of-regulation-</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>11 November 2016 - Conference: 'The relationship of the EU and the UK in the future of the Digital Single Market', House of Commons (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF5E6131-846E-4F6B-B6FA-BD1AC5EE8EBF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the first of two conferences covering the Digital Single Market. One-fourth of the European Commission's 2015 Communication 'Upgrading the Single Market: more opportunities for people and business' dealt with digital single market (DSM) initiatives. The conference addresses cross-border broadcasting, online services, copyright law and content provision. 
The speakers represented a wide range of stakeholders from industry, academia and regulatory bodies who addressed challenges and opportunities raised by Brexit. Two key challenges were identified: the loss of a UK voice within the EU policy-making and the Country of Origin (COO) principle which is embedded in many DSM Directives and Regulations. If the UK does not join the Single Market, broadcasters based in the UK may have to move their headquarters to an EU Member State and away from the UK to access EU markets post-Brexit. This is because cross-border broadcasting in Europe operates on the one-stop-shop Country of Origin (COO) principle which allows services to be provided in another EU Member State without restrictions. The COO is coupled with extensive requirements in relation to companies' operations which are embedded into Directives such as SatCab and the AVMSD. It was noted that the COO principle was to be extended to the EU's current copyright and geo-blocking proposals. The Council of Europe's potential role in addressing cross-border broadcasting was discussed and the point was raised that, in 2009, the EU claimed exclusive competence in many of the areas covered by the CoE Convention on Transfrontier Television (CTT). The CTT has subsequently not been updated and 7 EU members, in any case, never signed due to Member States' concern about overlapping competences. Speakers discussed the importance of: tariff free for goods for film and other content exports; freedom of movement for temporary and long term workers in the sector in order to maintain the talent pipeline with definition of creative industry roles as 'highly skilled workers'; continued UK/EU cooperation on intellectual property protection. Currently, the definition of 'European works' under AVMSD refers to works originating in European third States party to the European Convention on Transfrontier Television of the Council of Europe which include the UK. However, the reference to the CTT may disappear during the AVMS Directive's current revision. If the UK does not join the Single Market, UK-produced content will be excluded from national quotas in favour of EU-produced content in catalogues and channels. This means that programming produced by UK based companies will no longer be considered of 'European origin' for services such as Netflix which is based in the Netherlands and other traditional and online broadcasters based in EU Member States. Speakers discussed the shape of alternative trade models with the EU post-Brexit and whether the UK needed to either continue to participate in EU funding schemes for content or national level measures needed to be put in place too. Views were exchanged on emerging markets such as extension of EU directives to new platforms such as mobile phones and VR headsets. Lastly, EU negotiated exceptions for cultural goods under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and Most Favoured Nation exemptions for audio-visual services under GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) were discussed. The key challenge the UK could face is vulnerability to challenges to national content quotas, subsidies for film and television, duties on imports, deposits and tax credits for films and the subsidisation of public service broadcasting as has happened to other states without WTO exemptions. A more detailed summary of each talk is provided below. The below does not represent transcripts of speakers' talks but summaries of presentations provided on the day. I provided a14 page report to participants post-conference which is not public but available on request. 
The audience included representatives from the business community (broadcasters, marketing companies, distributors), associations (MPAA, UK Coalition for Cultural Diversity, Children's Media Foundation, Premier League, Communications Association for UK Interactive Entertainment, Royal Television Society, thePublishers Association), public service broadcasters, regulatory authorities (OFCOM, DCMS, BEIS), civil society representatives and MPs.

DESCRIPTION: The British decision to leave the European Union in the 23 June referendum will have profound consequences for the country's economic policy and the future of its trade relations. To inform this debate, the UCL European Institute hosted an afternoon of debate and discussion on the place of business and commercial interests in the negotiations to determine Britain's future relationship with Europe and the nature of Britain's trade and economic relations with the continent after Brexit. The event placed experts from the academic, policymaking and business communities in conversation with one another and with the audience. Among the questions addressed by the two panels were: What are the various options for Britain's future relationship with Europe? What will be the effect on the regulatory landscape of British withdrawal? What institutional form will the post-Brexit trading regime take? What will economic policy look like in post-Brexit Britain?

This conference addressed GDPR implementation, revision of the e-privacy Directive and issues of cross-border data handling under Brexit. Circa 150 people attended including representatives from the business community (broadcasters, marketing companies, distributors, data companies), associations (the DMA, Creative Industries Association, Civil Court Users Association, Electronic Money Association, Law Association), public service broadcasters, regulatory authorities, civil society representatives (Big Brother Watch, Open Rights Group, Privacy International) and MPs offices. 
The conference was run as part of the research project 'The UK Communication Industries: the impact of a proposed UK Brexit from the EU' led by Professor Alison Harcourt at the University of Exeter, which is funded by the 'UK in a Changing Europe' programme based at King's College London. It is the second of a series of conferences on the future of the Digital Single Market following stakeholder workshops earlier in the year. Drawing on key issues highlighted by the stakeholder workshops, this conference dealt with implementation of the GDPR, revision of the ePrivacy Directive and issues around the future of Fintech and virtual currencies.
The speakers represented a wide range of stakeholders from industry, academia and regulatory bodies who addressed challenges and opportunities raised by Brexit. EU Member States are currently implementing the GDPR, the European Commission has released a proposal to revise the ePrivacy Directive in January 2017 and the Payment Services Directive II is to come into force (including in the UK) in January 2018 under which certain powers have been delegated to the European Banking Authority. Speakers raised a number of key issues: it was confirmed that the GDPR must be implemented by May 2018 in the UK despite the Brexit vote. The future relationship with the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) is yet unsure. Much of the discussion surrounded adequacy post-Brexit. There was concern that the UK's new Investigatory Powers Act will not pass the adequacy test particularly post the Court of Justice's Judgment in Joined Cases C - 203/15 and C - 698/15 decided on December 21st 2016 which states that &amp;quot;General and indiscriminate retention&amp;quot; of emails and electronic communications is not legal. At the same time, the EU's manner of granting adequacy to third countries is seen as vulnerable under WTO trade laws. Company representatives pointed to inconsistencies between different jurisdictions and difficulties in implementation. I provided a 22 page report to participants post-conference which is not public but available on request. 
I also distributed my evidence submitted to the Culture, Media and Sport committee's inquiry into the Digital Single Market at the conference. http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/culture-media-and-sport-committee/impact-of-brexit/written/42276.pdf and a report authored by myself and Professor Lilian Edwards: http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/ukcommsexit/projectoutputs/.

This is because companies need an EU base (i.e. to be headquartered in the EU) to access service markets under Directives and Regulations which contain the country of origin (COO) principle. This affects e.g. 1523 UK-based television channels which target other EU countries (65% of the EU market) and 515 on-demand services such as video and catch-up services over DTT, cable, satellite, IPTV channels, online and mobile phones (20% share of the EU market). British-based companies would need to re-locate headquarters to an EU Member State. If the UK does not join the Digital Single Market (DSM), companies could broadcast to Europe from the UK under a bilateral agreement. However, the UK would lose voting rights for DSM legislation within the Council of Ministers and European Parliament. This loss of decision-making could affect the UK in key areas: rules governing right of reply, the definition of an economic service, editorial responsibility and effective control; a change in definition of the COO; incitement to hatred and the protection of minors; public health, public security, and consumer protection; the loss of subsidiarity for media markets under EU law. UK produced content could be excluded from national quotas in favour of EU-produced content in catalogues and channels. 
Post Brexit, the UK also loses EU negotiated exceptions for cultural goods under GATT; MFN exemptions for audio-visual services under GATS; and is released from EU bargaining over TTIP and bilateral treaty agreements the EU has with third countries. Exemptions include: screen quotas, subsidies, duties, deposits and taxes for film, the transmission of radio and television and video on-demand packages (linear and non-linear). The funding of public service broadcasting is protected by EU MFN exemptions to the WTO's 1995 Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures which determines whether or not a subsidy can be used by a WTO member. Related to this, the UK-led Public Value test for in a 2009 EU Communication which exempts psbs from EU state aid rules. 
The UK will move to 'association status' in EU coordinated self-regulatory fora such as the Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the European Regulators Group for Audio-visual Media Services (ERGA). The UK needs to negotiate independently in spectrum policy agreements at international levels (ITU, WRC) and CEPT) coordination bodies and in standards agreements post-Brexit which incurs greatly cost.
The Investigatory Powers Bill (and existing DRIPA) may not be adequate with the 2016 General Data Protection Regulation, e-commerce and e-privacy Directives which permit the free flow of data within the EU based upon the COO. These problems can be avoided by the use of standard contractual clauses but there are current legal challenges to the validity of these.
Divergence is expected between the UK and EU on 'deep packet capture'; analyses of metadata, and the harvesting of location data.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings and reports have been utilised by civil servants in preparing for Brexit, particularly those working in OFCOM and the DCMS who have provided feedback that my reports and workshops were highly useful and informative.
