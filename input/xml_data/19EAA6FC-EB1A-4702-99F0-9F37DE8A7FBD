In the first six months of 2015 a series of tragic vessel sinkings in the Mediterranean resulting in hundreds of migrant deaths forced the European Union to reconsider its refusal to support the Italian Navy's search and rescue operation Mare Nostrum, which had been suspended due to a funding dispute in October 2014. In April 2015 the European Council convened an emergency summit at which it was agreed to resume official search and rescue operations. The budget for the Operation Triton border surveillance and search and rescue operation was tripled and Germany, Ireland and the UK agreed to commit naval vessels to support the operation. By June 2015 some 137,000 migrants had made the sea crossing to Southern Europe with Greece (68,000) and Italy (67,500) taking the vast majority of new arrivals according to the UNHCR.

While the focus of European policy makers and the western media has centred on the Mediterranean because its dangerous international waters are now the last resort for those desperately fleeing conflict, forced conscription and destitution from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and beyond-the precarious trajectories and the hidden harms experienced by the irregular migrants and refugees are often overlooked and ignored. 

Aims and Objectives of the Proposal

In order to develop a rigorous, evidence based account of the human cost of the current Mediterranean emergency we therefore propose a research agenda that seeks to understand and demonstrate

(i) how the Mediterranean crossing is only a segment of more extensive and complex migration trajectories, linking distant countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia on the one side, and splintering across European space on the other
(ii) how different state and non-state actors can add or reduce friction to the mobility of migrants, thus shaping the directionality of migrants' trajectories as well as the risks to life and liberty faced by migrants and their families, and 
(iii) how conventional governmental and media representations can be qualified or challenged by giving voice to migrants as knowledge bearing subjects.

In adopting a research perspective that allows us to identify and trace the precarious trajectories of a constantly changing population in search of protection we will also seek to document and explore 

- the hidden harms that are experienced by and carried with 'illegalised' migrant populations
- the complicity of state and non-state actors in both failing to protect those in need because of their nationality status/statelessness and in actively contributing to the physical and psychological risks they face in escaping destitution and danger
- the role of official organisations and NGOs in promoting a humanitarian response to the migrant crisis and in generally mitigating harm 
- the official and media representation of migrant subjects as bearers of 'collective harm' and radical 'otherness' with respect to western populations, economies and cultural and religious values 
- facilitating alternative representations through auto-ethnography and other migrant subject based counter-narratives 

Potential Applications and Benefits

Our multidisciplinary approach will lead to outputs of different formats including

-a documentary film
-videos of migrants testimonies and of field visits
-maps of migrants' trajectories and of the spatial practices of the actors they encounter
-written analyses, articles and reports to be published in academic, policy and news contexts

These outputs will not only allow us to engage a broad public, our insights will be crucial for policy makers in terms of enabling them to better understand how policies translate at the ground level, and what - at times unexpected - consequences they may have, in particular in terms of making migrants trajectories more or less dangerous or addressing the challenges of integration under the current EU asylum and refugee protocols.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate that the in-project impact of Precarious Trajectories will be measured in terms of a greater public awareness of the complexity of the migrant trajectory and the factors that shape it, the varied motives for attempting (or not) the Mediterranean crossing and the conditions faced by migrants prior to, during and after the crossing. 

Using previous ESRC Urgent Calls as evaluation benchmarks we will measure visits to the project website and video host channel, Facebook likes and shares, and Twitter follows, shares and reads together with attendance at lectures, talks and media interview reach. We also aim to target key policy-makers, decision-takers and stakeholders in the national and EU migration field through our electronic mailing list and other relevant distribution lists with a special focus on the preliminary findings report for which a press launch will be held in London and Palermo 6 months into the project. In the first phase of the research our impact activity will centre on co-producing a constantly updated digital archive of migrant trajectory narratives and maps through our project website and YouTube/Vimeo video channel. The website will feature videos of migrants' testimonies and of field visits, maps of migrants' trajectories and of the spatial practices of the actors they encounter, as well as written analysis, articles and reports, in a way that operates similarly to Forensic Oceanography's page dedicated to the Left-to-die boat case (http://www.forensic-architecture.org/case/left-die-boat/) but expanded to multiple trajectories and with a broader geographic focus. We will work with the ESRC communications team to distribute news of these resources and noteworthy updates and additions to relevant UK social science audiences, policy makers and advisors, third sector organisations, key stakeholders and interested members of the public.

The medium-term impact will centre on the end of project conference in Geneva in collaboration with UNHCR (target=minimum of 100 delegates) and online conference proceedings with follow-up post-project workshop activities in London and York together with the documentary film showings and on-line release. We will work closely with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to co-develop an investigative stream on the Mediterranean Crisis that will feature on the highly visited BIJ and which will form the basis of news and current affairs stories for national/international TV, radio and the press. We will also collaborate with humanitarian organisations including WatchTheMed and Amnesty International in sharing and publicising our data through joint media events where possible and appropriate. 

We see the main long term impact in terms of sustained collaboration with the Mayor and City Council of Palermo around the 'sono umano' (I am human) project to develop a network of European cities committed to a more humanitarian response to the migrant crisis and to freedom of movement that will draw on the Precarious Trajectories research materials and academic publications as a strong evidence base. We also aim to use the documentary film as a continuing vehicle for publicising the project's main findings at public meetings, conferences and workshops. Follow up interviews with the research team around the documentary's subsequent screenings at film festivals will ensure a continued media presence for the project 2-3 years after completion.We would measure impact in terms of the use of our research materials by policy makers, NGOs and media outlets together with final project report and academic paper mentions and citations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>137564</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Venice Biennale of Architecture, 28 May-27 November 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>ABF7E38B-1A34-4832-A2C3-C227D15467F0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Forensic Oceanography project - partly developed under the auspices of Precarious Trajectories continues to bring advanced research technology and data visualisation to the analysis of deaths at sea resulting from the Mediterranean migration crisis and helps to bring these issues to a wide audience including journalists, advocacy groups and human rights lawyers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e047c9b12e27.40066231</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Forensic Architecture</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/exhibition/participants/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Film documentary interview with the Mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando.

A separate video installation based on the project findings and curated by research team members Heller and Pezzani &amp;quot;Death by Rescue&amp;quot; was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in May 2016 and subsequently at the Baltic Gallery, Gateshead as part of the &amp;quot;Disappearance at-sea/ Mare nostrum&amp;quot; exhibition 27 January - 14 May 2017 http://www.balticmill.com/whats-on/disappearance-at-sea-mare-nostrum

The PI, Dr Simon Parker, took part in a round table briefing with senior civil servants from the Department for International Development on the key findings of the Mediterranean Migration Research Programme (MMRP) Urgency Call in Whitehall on 14 December 2016.

Dr Parker is also contributing to the MMRP policy briefing for parliamentarians organised in collaboration with the All Party Group on Refugees which is scheduled for 8 May 2017.

Professor Sue Clayton organised and presented findings from the Precarious Trajectories research project at Goldsmiths, University of London as part of an exhibition WHEN WORDS FAIL and I AM HUMAN- PRECARIOUS JOURNEYS, an award winning installation that previewed at Senate House, University of London on 17 November, as part of the national BEING HUMAN festival, which was subsequently shown at St James Hatcham gallery, New Cross from 18th-20th November 2016 https://issuu.com/schoolofadvancedstudy/docs/bh_2016_funded_events_leaflet_first</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9992F312-9A69-4558-8318-79122265AD04</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e04a21df5ed2.64869759</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Having examined the conditions and political decisions that led to the deaths of more than 1,200 individuals in a single week in April 2015, the Precarious Trajectories &amp;quot;Death by Rescue&amp;quot; (deathbyrescue.org) investigation found that the two shipwrecks were &amp;quot;the predicted and predictable consequence of the EU's policy of non-assistance.&amp;quot; In particular, our report highlighted that EU policymakers and member states decided to end Italy's Mare Nostrum operation without an adequate replacement, despite knowing and explicitly stating that this would lead to an increase in deaths in the Mediterranean. In part, this decision was taken because the Search and Rescue [SAR] activities Mare Nostrum undertook off the Libyan coast had come to be assumed to constitute a &amp;quot;pull factor&amp;quot; for refugees and migrants, a claim for which our (and other research within the Mediterranean Migration Research Programme) does not find evidence.

? In interviews with shipwreck survivors and those who had made the passage across the central and eastern Mediterranean we were able to establish that a complex range of &amp;quot;drivers&amp;quot; accounted for the movement of refugees and migrants to Europe - but that the overwhelming majority had originated in zones of major conflict (Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Eritrea, Sudan). Persecution and fear of violence from state or other actors was often a factor in deciding to leave or to move on from transit destinations where lack of economic opportunities and discrimination in schooling, housing and access to health care could also become push factors over time. We found that knowledge of the relative ease or difficulty of making asylum applications in individual European countries was relatively low, especially among less educated refugees and migrants. Equally, knowledge of the existence of benefit and welfare services was scant and often ill-informed. The opportunity for paid work and education was the reason most often given.&amp;quot;Hope of a better life&amp;quot; - which was mostly expressed in terms of the chance for a quiet and peaceful existence and to establish a stable family life was the most common response to the initial question relating to the decision to make the sea journey to Europe. A feeling that Europe would provide this safety and opportunity was widespread among the refugees we interviewed in the late summer and autumn of 2015, but this had given way to increasing frustration and anger with the European authorities by the spring of 2016 when in March the EU/Turkey agreement effectively closed the Aegean route to new migrant arrivals. At the same time during the winter of 2015/16 border crossings on the Eastern Aegean route were closed and border controls tightened between Italy and France, Switzerland and Austria - effectively containing the displaced population from the Mediterranean route in Greece and Italy.
 
? Our interviews with NGOs and volunteers also confirmed evidence of an increasing criminalisation of humanitarian intervention at sea and of solidarity initiatives (such as soup kitchens and accommodation provision) on land. This was accompanied by more coercive and violent policing - even against women and children - and an increasing securitisation of reception camps and border crossings. This reflected an increasingly hostile attitude towards displaced populations within Europe and those attempting to make the crossing at elite level within EU policy making circles and among individual member states, together with increasing anti-migrant sentiment in the print and broadcast media and among even mainstream political parties despite a short-lived wave of sympathy following the death by drowning of the toddler Alan Kurdi.

In adopting a research perspective that allows us to identify and trace the precarious trajectories of a constantly changing population in search of protection we sought to document and explore the impact of state bordering at sea and on land using a variety of methods ranging from vessel tracking data to visual ethnography and documentary filmmaking. The investigation included field work (interviews, data collection, field observations) undertaken in Libya, Italy, Greece and Germany.

A public facing account of these findings is contained in the research documentary film; 'Precarious Trajectories: Voices from the Mediterranean Migration Crisis' (UK, 33 minutes) written and directed by project PI Dr Simon Parker.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our multidisciplinary approach has led to research outputs of different formats including a 33 minute documentary film 'Precarious Trajectories' - accompanying videos of key policy actors [including the Mayor of Palermo] and testimonies of migrants, NGO workers, volunteers, and local citizens and of the spatial practices of the actors they encounter . The project has also produced and is in the process of producing a number of online blogs, articles and reports published in academic, policy and news contexts. 

These high impact outputs have allowed us to engage with a broad national and international public, and to share our insights with policy makers at DFID and elsewhere thus enabling colleagues to better understand how policies translate at the ground level, and what - at times unexpected - consequences they may have, in particular in terms of making migrants trajectories more or less dangerous or addressing the challenges of integration under the current EU asylum and refugee protocols.

In particular, project team members have worked closely with NGOs involved in humanitarian interventions in the Mediterranean on behalf of those fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty. Amnesty International has been a particularly important partner in disseminating multimedia and web-based content surrounding the issue of migrant deaths at sea and the role of state actors - most notably at the recent DISAPPEARANCE AT SEA - MARE NOSTRUM exhibition at the Baltic Gallery in Gateshead http://www.balticmill.com/whats-on/disappearance-at-sea-mare-nostrum

'Death by Rescue' also featured in the Forensic Architecture exhibition at the Venice Biennale of Architecture, http://u-in-u.com/venice-biennale/2016-architecture/central-expo-giardini/forensic-architecture/ 28 May-27 November 2016. Part of a showcase of work on the application of forensic research in support of human rights violation investigations by the Forensic Architecture Agency based at Goldsmiths University of London directed by Precarious Trajectories Co-Investigator Eyal Weizman. Death by Rescue installation curated by Charles Heller and Lorenzo Pezzani - research fellows on the Precarious Trajectories project. According to its scientific committee, the Biennale attracted 260,000 visitors (exact figure: 259,725) over six months.

The UNICEF multi-media feature 'Children on the Move' included an interview with Dr Simon Parker (project PI) who discussed the findings of PT in connection with the fate of unaccompanied children and the particular vulnerabilities they faced in terms of the journey across the Mediterranean and once they arrive in Europe as well as what more could be done by governments and non-governmental agencies to alleviate the risks children face and to improve their well-being (see https://www.unicef-irc.org/research-watch/Children-on-the-move/). The project PI is currently working on a series of parliamentary briefings for a high level policy sharing event on the Mediterranean Migration Research Programme scheduled for May sponsored by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Refugees. The results of the project findings will also be shared at the inaugural conference of the University of York Migration Network Conference &amp;quot;Ways of Telling&amp;quot; 26-27 May which will include senior representatives from UNICEF and the Refugee Council.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>89D99D12-332D-4BE5-B4EF-59AE114C5BCE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e049cb1c1cc1.47191614</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://precarioustrajectories.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>I AM HUMAN is an app that will help you tell the story of your choices and your journey to safety.
