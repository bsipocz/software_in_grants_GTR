Experiencing objects in this way provides an opportunity to participate in the sensory worlds of the past and offers new forms of accessibility for a wide range of museum visitors. The focus of the proposed research cluster is this virtual handling of museum objects, with archaeological textiles selected as a case study. New touch technologies offer the chance to handle virtual replicas of these rare and fragile objects. In addition, such a computer system is far more portable than a large collection of real objects and so offers significant outreach potential for public groups unable to visit the museum.\n \nOn seeing a textile it is natural to wish to handle it - the characteristic mechanical and surface properties of textiles are best understood by manipulation. Hence archaeological textiles are a particularly good choice of artefact for virtual handling. Conveniently, current interface technology is particularly suited to represent light, flexible objects such as textiles. \n\nThe overall aim of the cluster is to develop an improved understanding of the potential for virtual handling of archaeological textiles, leading to one or more major research proposals to develop and implement these techniques. The cluster is planned to involve 24 participants (plus new researchers and research students) from at least 12 institutions, including a 'core team' of six who are responsible for overall strategy. The cluster will bring together specialists in the areas of textile archaeology, museum display, computer interfaces, etc., to establish what is currently achievable, what is realistically achievable through future collaboration, and what technologies and techniques need further development.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24205</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>replica textile samples</gtr:description><gtr:id>730FC120-D6E4-4A6E-B54C-DE7A74DCA669</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The replica has formed part of a pop up exhibition entitled 'Touching the Past' which has been seen in Museums in Netherlands, Finland, Spain and the UK and taken to British and European conferences.

I discussed the Touching the Past project and showed some examples. The 3rd Exeter Dialogue with Science Workshop for this project contained elements of the Touching the past project as part of discussions on multisensory experiences in museums. This meeting was reported back to all partners within the EU project. I suggested using their scans to print the reconstructed houses so that visually impaired visitors could orientate themselves within the site and within houses and better understand the above head height elements.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Colonial Williamsburg, USA, public engagment</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EA15702C-3056-44DF-8630-2B9CBD045B14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Colonial Williamsburg, USA is the largest Open Air Museum in the US and Prof Linda hurcombe, Dr Theresa Kamper and Mr Matt Sweiton were all involved in presenting crafts and replicas and 3D prints to the general public and to visitors who included historical re-enactors, historical interpreters, visiting undergraduate and postgraduate students and visiting university lecturers.
