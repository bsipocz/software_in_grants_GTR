Our focus is on places where people often 'hang out', often unglamorous micro-places characterised by a bench, a low wall, a nearby takeaway or a park entrance. The people for whom the outside is a place to pass time are commonly 'outsiders' in different sense: individuals and groups who may not be able or want to stay at home or at workplaces, and can't financially afford to spend time in more convivial or protected leisure environments. 

The aim of the research is to investigate the stories, memories and practices of people in using these places and to explore how the physical environment becomes a site of social interaction. The project will address how different dimensions of identity (race, class, gender, age) inform these encounters. Though the urban bench may occupy a nostalgic position in conceptions of neighbourliness, this research will also investigate aspects of inequality, conflict and control. In particular, we note increasing concern about gathering in public places (such as use of dispersal orders) and how places are often sanitised, including the removal of benches, with the aim of deterring longer-stay use of the public realm. The research will explore how casting certain groups of public space users as problematic (for example, young people) is at odds with public policy on mental, physical and social wellbeing which emphasises multiple benefits to being outdoors and participating in social contexts.

The research sits within the AHRC Connected Communities programme. It is conducted in two different London neighbourhoods, working with community organisations as Co-Investigators. The primary method will be the making of a high quality film, a fact-fiction hybrid approach to documentary in which the filmmaker collaborates with participants to generate creative material, drawing on their own memories, stories and values. The starting point will be the choice of a bench within each neighbourhood, the participants generating ideas about mini-stories from the point of view of the bench and its experiences over time. A ten minute film will be produced, accompanied by a booklet with the research findings and process. The film will be shown locally, will be the focus of a stakeholder workshop, and also be widely distributed within academic, policy and community contexts. The film will inform research data through the gathering and interaction of personal stories, the development of the film narrative itself, and its potential to prompt responses from people in different positions and with varied areas of expertise.

The research will be of benefit to academics researching social use of urban places (especially in diverse or disadvantaged contexts) and those whose agenda also includes place change either through design/regeneration (architecture, landscape architecture, planning) or through policy. Policy impacts include influencing agendas regarding public health, social inclusion, intercultural integration, supporting participation of elderly and young residents, and addressing hate crime and harassment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Public Sector: This project has relevance to a wide range of priorities facing Local Authorities and City Mayor's offices. Council members, policy makers and front-line workers are involved in addressing exclusion and disconnection in these everyday locations. This is a cross-cutting project which combines 'place' agendas (planners, housing landscapes, city centre revitalisation) with social cohesion and wellbeing (community safety and policing, harassment and hate crime, anti-social behaviour, social inclusion and marginalised groups, youth participation). 

Third sector/NGOs. 1. Supporting vulnerable and marginalised groups, for example in homelessness (eg Turning Point, Crisis); with refugees and asylum seekers (Refugee Youth, Refugee Housing Associations); tackling mental health issues (eg MIND, Mental Health Foundation, MAC UK); ageing and associated (eg dementia-friendly communities, Big's Ageing Better, the Campaign to End Loneliness and Age UK). 2. Addressing social capital and the role of social connections in health and well-being, public health bodies in local government and Public Health England. 3. Community cohesion (eg The Young Foundation (CI this project), JRF, Institute of Public Policy Research). 4. Promoting and delivering green space management and place making, eg (Spacemakers, place-making.org, GreenSpace, Groundwork). 

Professional bodies and private sector: The work and expertise of many professional groups directly impacts on the quality of the local public realm. Landscape Architects (Landscape Institute), Planners (RTPI), Architects (RIBA) Greenspace managers, Youthworkers, Social workers and mental health support professionals. 

Community groups: Neighbourhood and housing organisations, local campaigns for improving environmental quality i.e. 'Friends of...', community activists. For example in one of the project locations: Greenwich Inclusion Project (CI this project), Migrant Welcome, Greenwich Mind, Greenwich BME forum, Greenwich Older Voices. Also un-affiliated people who need or want to spend time outdoors, including elderly people, carers of young children, and people with little disposable income to spend time in 'paid-for' leisure locations.

Filmmakers and enthusiasts: specifically those interested in documentary forms.

Research team and project participants: Involvement in the filmmaking process gives participants a means of communicating what is important to them, and an insight into making a professional film. We aim to build capacity for future collaboration with academic research in the community CIs and fieldworkers.

How we will initiate change:
+ Perceptual shift through sharing narratives that are voiced through the research process: why particular places are used in certain ways, what difficult situations are perceived and worked through, how safety and sociability are experienced by different individuals and groups. (Aims 1, 2, 5)
+ Deepen understanding of how marginalised groups benefit from spending time outdoors, what problems are commonly faced, and what strategies are used to overcome these. (Aims 3, 4, 5)
+ Encourage NGOs to engage with the potential of using local outdoor space to achieve their aims (i.e. for their client group), to be realistic about barriers and opportunities, and to inform their own policies and practices. (Aims 2, 3, 4)
+ Co-produce (between participants and relevant organisations listed above) a shared analysis of the impact of controls on public space and processes that sanitise and stigmatise users of public open space. Scope to impact community policing policy and practice. (Aim 4)
+ Inform design and policy practice of gathering places in neighbourhood localities, challenge agendas of 'sanitisation', provide material for government planning panels and community design processes (local and national impact). (Aims 1, 2)
+ Demonstrate potential of research/community/arts collaborations in documentary filmmaking (Aim 5).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>85932</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Alone Together, 4 minute edit focusing on the Nepali community of Woolwich.</gtr:description><gtr:id>94FF4ECE-E161-451A-A1C9-A92426923CE9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of the 4 minute edit I made of 'Alone Together' for NOWNESS, Esther Johnson has been asked to submit ideas for new works for NOWNESS.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c85464591ff5.26557244</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Alone Together, 4 minute edit focusing on the Nepali community of Woolwich - featured on NOWNESS</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.nowness.com/story/alone-together-the-social-life-of-park-benches-esther-johnson</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>lone Together, the Social Life of Benches illuminates the thoughts and memories of frequent users of two public spaces in London: General Gordon Square, Woolwich and St Helier Open Space, Sutton.

Revolving around the micro-space of the humble bench, the experiential capacity of film is used to highlight themes such as the feeling of being in a space, the rhythm and flow of visitors to a place, and the importance of design for everyday street furniture.

The film acts like a stranger who joins you on a bench to 'watch the world go by', and to break the ice by starting a conversation with their fellow bench user.

At the local scale, in Greenwich the deeper knowledge of the Nepali community and establishment of good links between these residents and Greenwich Inclusion Project has led to better informed discussions with regard to housing and benefits. In Sutton the work has stimulated discussion on access specifically with groups of older people. 
The specific finding of the importance of being able to sit outside for supporting wellbeing and inclusion for people marginalised from eduction, work and paid-for leisure facilities has led to developing new programmes for developing impact with refugees. In particular, new funding has been found to develop impact between refugee support services and public open space organisations.
The making of the Alone Together film has been important in bridging professional silos with regard to the arts and narratives of wellbeing, and has been important in developing discussion on film and oral history, representation on documentary film of 'lived experience' and interactions between ethnography and film.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CEFC7236-DD14-42BE-A4CC-BCF777F7A822</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddef20a3a0e2.40118028</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Benches are valued as public, egalitarian and free.
 
Bench-space allows people to loosely belong within the flow of city life, to see and be seen. Solitude and conversation are equally acceptable.
 
Sitting on benches supports healthy everyday routines by enabling people to spend longer outside. These opportunities to rest can be restorative for mental health and support local walking when personal mobility is limited.
 
Benches function as a social resource - they are flexible places to spend time at no cost. This is appreciated by many, and especially vital for people who are largely marginalised from other collective environments such as work, cafes, educational or leisure facilities. They are contrasted positively with crowded, lonely or boring home situations.
 
Design of benches and of sittable public space is important. Comfort and accessibility are basic requirements. Clustering of benches and co-location with a range of facilities provides interest and gives legitimacy to hanging out. The ability to gather in larger groups is valued by many.
 
People need to feel safe. Frequently used, visible spaces with a choice of where to sit can support this. A mix of short and long stay bench users supports informal safety in numbers. Quality of materials, attractive planting, and cleanliness of public space seems to increase individual tolerance for the proximity of strangers and diverse ways of enjoying public space.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Making Benches Better: Points for Action

Benches should be recognised and promoted as a social good, core to supporting mental health and active lifestyles policies. Local strategies should address inequality in quantity and quality of benches in urban locations, and these should reflect the access and wellbeing requirements of different users of benches.

Formal and incidental public space should be maximised as a local social resource by clustering of benches and co-location with leisure facilities and local services.

Design of public spaces should increase the quantity and diversity of non-commercial seating, and introduce natural elements and planting wherever possible. The traditional two-seater bench may have had its day: longer benches and larger seating structures are more adaptable in supporting fluid social networks.

Benches need to be comfortable as well as robust. 'Hostile architecture' approaches have led to a reduction of bench provision and the specification of deliberately uncomfortable seating in some places. Thermal comfort, height, backs and arms of benches need to be human friendly. Research and innovation in product design and landscape architecture are needed.

Management of public spaces should ensure hanging out is legitimised as a non-criminal activity: balancing safety agendas with a meaningful inclusivity of diverse people and activities. In busy urban places the role of uniformed wardens is largely welcomed in maintaining acceptable communal behaviour as long as this is exercised with a light touch.

Minimise potential conflict to reduce reliance on explicit security measures. 'Anti-social behaviour' is often simply differently-social. While violent or hate crime should be actively addressed, this should not be at the expense of bench provision or the quality of the public space. People should be encouraged to use benches through integrated planning, design and management. Key aims should be to support high pedestrian movement through open space networks, maintain good visibility, zone quieter and noisier areas and give options of where to sit.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>49AB3AF9-E8FD-4064-9765-35A93E8D8339</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c64235ea6275.94343444</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://the-bench-project.weebly.com/research.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>39FE6E56-E99D-4609-901D-EBD19BC937B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sitting outside: conviviality, self-care and the design of benches in urban public space</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/08c43252f51bdfc827bb6ef167ced793"><gtr:id>08c43252f51bdfc827bb6ef167ced793</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rishbeth C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc510cc1829.54662138</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E5760DAA-A44F-4B4D-9D22-1EA9745E3378</gtr:id><gtr:title>Benches for Everyone.
