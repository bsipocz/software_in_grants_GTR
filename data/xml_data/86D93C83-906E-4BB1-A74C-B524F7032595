The fire resistance of composite structures has therefore become of major concern to designers. In the most recent design codes, notably Eurocodes 1, 3 and 4, fire is treated as one of the basic design limit states for structures, which is in itself a major step forward in philosophy from the previous emphasis on prescriptive requirements for fire protection. A range of design procedures at different levels of complexity and conservatism allows designers to move away from prescriptive requirements towards appropriate performance-based concepts. Fire resistance of structural elements is defined according to up to three criteria: (1) Structural Stability; (2) Integrity; (3) Insulation. Failure occurs when any one of these is violated. The first of these applies to all types of elements; the other two apply only to separating elements such as floor slabs and walls. Over the past decade a significant amount of research has developed numerical models of the structural behaviour of composite slabs in fire conditions. These are all based on a continuum approach in which local concrete failure is represented by smeared cracking. These models can predict the global behaviour of concrete slabs subject to large deflection with reasonable accuracy, at least until fracture begins to dominate. However, they cannot predict localized failures due to individual large cracks through the slab thickness. It is clear that when this type of crack forms the criterion of structural integrity is violated, although stability may still be maintained. It is therefore important to develop a robust numerical procedure with which both structural stability and integrity can be assessed, so that a meaningful failure definition can be identified by the analysis. Performance-based designs may therefore currently have to rely on arbitrary and inappropriate limiting deflection criteria, such as the span/30 , span/20 and limiting deflection rate criteria used in Eurocode 1 Part 1-2 and BS476 to control furnace testing. These deflection criteria have very little scientific basis, and are generally assumed to have been developed empirically to protect short-span furnaces under standard fire conditions. This arbitrary element significantly undermines the power of the performance-based design method. It is the objective of the proposed research to tackle this important and difficult issue. The direct aim of the project is to develop a practical and robust numerical procedure to model localized fracture of reinforced concrete slabs at high temperatures. The layered reinforced concrete slab elements will consist of three components, representing the plain concrete slabs, reinforcing steel bars and the bond characteristics between concrete and reinforcement. The model should have the ability to assess both the structural stability and the integrity of floor slabs, in order to identify meaningful fire resistance failure points, and should be suitable for direct employment in structural fire engineering design of composite and concrete buildings. For the first time this procedure will enable designers to assess fire resistance of a building directly on the basis of both the structural stability and integrity criteria. This would dramatically change structural fire engineering design practice, in which arbitrary limiting deflections, of either span/30 or span/20, are currently used by consulting engineers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposed research addresses the main problem of predicting localised failure (full-depth cracking) when modeling composite floors in fire. The area is a strong focus of research for a number of researchers and is a major topic of discussion at international workshops and forums. In terms of practical application the use of the current models in performance-based fire engineering is being significantly hindered by the current inability to predict failure with any confidence. The proposed research project aims to develop a computational method to model localized fracture in composite floors under fire conditions. The novelty of this research is that the developed model can be used to assess, for the first time, both the structural stability and integrity of floor slabs. The significance of this project is that it may dramatically change structural fire engineering design practice, in which arbitrary limiting deflections are used by consulting engineers and fire authorities. If successful this project will lead the way in this research field and contribute significantly to the UK's research standing. It has been known for some time that the modelling of composite steel buildings under fire conditions is limited due to the lack of accurately modelling localised integrity fracture. The proposed research is fundamental to provide the confidence and 'step-change' within the fire community to allow wide-spread use of performance-based design approaches. The most immediate pay-back from this research will be to the group of UK consulting engineers who have pioneered the use of a performance-based modelling approach to the fire-resistance design of steel and composite framed buildings and, immediately downstream, to UK fabricators and the constructional steel industry. The project will have a direct impact on the practice of performance-based structural fire engineering design, and will consolidate considerably the lead that the UK has in its practical use in the design of major construction projects. For the first time this advance will allow designers to use rational definitions of failure of both structural stability and integrity in thermo-structural modelling, and will enable the development of detailing arrangements at support beams and core interfaces which resist integrity failure due to localisation of cracking. The improved facility for predicting compartment failure associated with fracture of the concrete accompanied by loss of reinforcement bond will also be usable by checking authorities, by using computational analysis of structural subframes. The proposed research will lead to the training of a Research Associate within a very important area of structural fire engineering. In addition the research work will also feed into the training of a number of research students within the well established fire research group at Sheffield. Implementation of the procedures will also help researchers to investigate the fundamental local and global behaviour of composite buildings in fire much more effectively than the current smeared-cracking approaches. The proposed research will therefore make a large contribution to future design code development, with the public at large eventually benefiting from significantly more secure and soundly-based design methods, since it will lead to the design of more economical and safer buildings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>290201</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Steel-framed structures, particularly of composite construction, are widely used in the UK for multi-storey buildings. The fire resistance of composite structures has therefore become of major concern to designers. Fire resistance of structural elements is defined according to up to three criteria: (1) Structural Stability; (2) Integrity; (3) Insulation. The currently available models of performing non-linear analysis of the behaviour of large-scale floor systems in fire treats concrete as a homogeneous material, and treats cracking as being &amp;quot;smeared&amp;quot;, both horizontally and through the layer system used in the slab model. This is practical but fallacious. Being a brittle material, concrete does not smear cracks and several large localised cracks would be created when the floor slabs are subjected to larger deflection under fire conditions. Therefore, the currently available models cannot predict localized failures due to individual large cracks through the slab thickness. The realistic failure (fire resistance) of a composite structure, based on structural integrity criterion cannot be evaluated. 
This research addressed the main problem of predicting localised failure (full-depth cracking) when modelling composite floors in fire. The area is a strong focus of research for a number of researchers and is a major topic of discussion at international workshops and forums. This research tackled the following difficult numerical problems: (1) the treatment of crack propagation and the resulting displacement discontinuity over the depth of floor slabs; (2) the occurrence of multiple spurious cracks within an incremental solution procedure, depending on the step size; (3) tracing the nonlinear equilibrium paths of reinforced concrete structures, accounting for material softening due to cracking and nonlinear bond slip. The novelty of this research is that the developed models can be used to assess, for the first time, both the structural stability and integrity of reinforced concrete beams and floor slabs. The significance of this research is that it may dramatically change structural fire engineering design practice, in which arbitrary limiting deflections are used by consulting engineers and fire authorities.

The main achieved objectives of this project are: 
(1) Developed the mesh-independent procedures to model localised crack initiation and growth in plain concrete beams and slabs at elevated temperatures, and to integrate the plain concrete beam and slab elements with existing reinforcing steel bar and bond-link elements for modelling of reinforced concrete beams and floor slabs in fire. 
(2) Performed detailed studies on the influence of support conditions, bond characteristics, and reinforcement details such as cover to bars, their sizing and ductility specification, requirements for anchorage and continuity across supporting beams, on localized failure of reinforced concrete beams and slabs at high deflection. 
(3) Investigated in detail the localized integrity failure patterns of the highly deflected composite floors. 
(4) Postulated an initial set of design recommendations for composite buildings for a performance-based structural fire engineering philosophy, based on maintaining both integrity and stability of fire compartments in fire conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The most immediate pay-back from this research will be to the group of UK consulting engineers who have pioneered the use of a performance-based modelling approach to the fire resistance design of concrete and composite framed buildings.
