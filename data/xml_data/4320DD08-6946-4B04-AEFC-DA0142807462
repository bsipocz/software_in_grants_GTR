If two objects look similar, then a first guess is that they might have similar functions. Likewise, comparison of the biological molecules DNA, RNA and proteins from different individuals or species is central to understanding what each molecule does. DNA, RNA and protein molecules can be represented as sequences of letters and it is these sequences that are compared by computer programs. For example, comparison of a protein sequence from a plant disease-causing bacterium with that from the plant may suggest ways to design a treatment to kill the bacterium and not the plant. Ideally, more than two sequences are compared at the same time as this makes it easier to spot common features. This process is called 'multiple sequence alignment' and is one of the most powerful techniques available in modern biology. Easy-to-use but feature-rich interactive computer programs are essential to visualise and enable the most information to be extracted from multiple sequence alignments. Jalview, is generally agreed to be the most widely used program for visualising sequence alignments and editing them. It is installed on over 16,000 computers world-wide, on millions of web pages, and in daily use by thousands of scientists and students. Although other programs exist to visualise and edit multiple alignments, Jalview not only allows alignments to be viewed coloured and edited, but also exploits the internet to connect to over 70 sources of sequences and complex annotations on those sequences. In addition, Jalview exploits state-of-the-art internet technology to connect to computer servers that can perform large calculations on the sequences and return these to the user in a few seconds or minutes. In this way the program puts a mass of human knowledge at the fingertips of the scientist and so saves them a huge amount of time in exploring the function of their favourite protein, DNA or RNA molecule. Some databases of sequence alignments contain alignments with over 70,000 sequences. New technology in DNA sequencing is enabling sequences to be determined faster than ever, so the total volume of sequence data available is doubling approximately once a year. However, sophisticated computer programs like Jalview require maintenance to fix bugs and to introduce new features as new techniques and data sources are developed world-wide. Core funding for Jalview development ended in 2007, so in order to ensure that Jalview can meet the needs of its large community in the face of the data onslaught, we are requesting support for staff and training to maintain and develop the Jalview Resource. The principal aims of the resource will be: 1. To provide core support and maintenance. 2. To continue to drive Jalview development to meet the needs of new research techniques and data types through close interactions with the research groups at Dundee and elsewhere, and to add new features to Jalview to support visualisation and data analysis for services developed in the UK and rest of the World. 3. To facilitate the open development of Jalview as a community project by coordinating Jalview development by software developers in the community with needs for specific new features. 4. To provide extensive web-based user-documentation and programming guides for Jalview as well as regular training workshops both for end-users of Jalview and for developers who wish to add Jalview to their resources, or develop new features. 5. To seek out funding opportunities for new developments to Jalview above and beyond those possible with the resources requested in this application. The applications of the jalview resource are many fold, from a teaching tool, though a figure-for-publication-making tool and expert analysts' workbench, to a neat way to display sequence alignments on a web page. The applications of Jalview span all areas of biology and so the benefits of the resource are legion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The analysis of sequences is carried out by all scientists interested in the functions of genes and proteins, and relies on techniques for sequence alignment. Working with alignments requires powerful, but easy-to-use interactive tools. The Jalview Resource is based on the Jalview open-source, GPL-licenced multiple sequence alignment editor and analysis workbench. Jalview (2.4) is installed on over 16,000 computers world-wide, and according to Google, is mentioned on millions of web pages. In applet form, Jalview is exploited by major databases such as Pfam and the EBI services. In addition to sophisticated multiple alignment editing functions for DNA, RNA and Protein sequences, that include multiple levels of 'undo', multiple 'views' and the ability to 'hide' sequences and columns of an alignment, Jalview provides linked views of trees, DNA and Protein sequences, and protein three-dimensional structures. It communicates with webservices via SOAP for CPU intensive analyses on remote servers, with three standard multiple alignment algorithms and the JPred secondary structure prediction server currently available at Dundee. Jalview also reads and displays annotations from more than 70 DAS servers available world-wide, as well as locally installed servers. Thus, Jalview is a net-centred application that puts distributed data and compute resources at the fingertips of its users. Our aim is to provide core, co-ordinating support for Jalview and its growing user community. Funding will help us to encourage and integrate voluntary code contributions from the Jalview community, and further develop the resource through user and developer workshops and on-line documentation. Support from BBSRC will ensure the existing BBSRC investment in Jalview is maintained and that Jalview development can continue to respond to the needs of its significant user base in the biological research community.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>542923</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, San Francisco</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization and Informatics</gtr:department><gtr:description>UCSF Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization and Informatics</gtr:description><gtr:id>10D84E31-FA8C-4628-BB11-F00DDA442656</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New functionality for the Jalview software platform to control UCSF Chimera.

Jalview is free software for protein and nucleic acid sequence alignment generation, visualisation and analysis. It includes sophisticated editing options and provides a range of analysis tools to investigate the structure and function of macromolecules through a multiple window interface. For example, Jalview supports 8 popular methods for multiple sequence alignment, prediction of protein secondary structure by JPred and disorder prediction by four methods. Jalview also has options to generate phylogenetic trees, and assess consensus and conservation across sequence families. Sequences, alignments and additional annotation can be accessed directly from public databases and journal-quality figures generated for publication.

The course involves of a mixture of talks and hands-on exercises.

Day 1 is an introduction to protein multiple sequence alignment editing and analysis with Jalview.

Day 2 focuses on using Jalview for RNA sequence analysis, and also integrating cDNA and protein analysis and covers more advanced applications after lunch.

Day 3 concentrates on protein secondary structure prediction with JPred version 4 as well as protein sub-family analysis to identify functionally important residues.

There will be opportunities for attendees to get advice on analysis of their own sequence families.

Multiple Sequence Alignment and Analysis with Jalview

This workshop course employs talks and hands-on exercises to help students start using the versatile protein and nucleic acid alignment and visualisation software Jalview (developed within the School of Life Sciences). Over two sessions, we will cover launching Jalview, accessing sequence, alignment and 3D structure databases, creating, editing and analysing alignments, phylogenetic trees, visualisation of 3D structure data, and preparation of figures for presentation and publication.

Wednesday afternoons 13.00 to 17.00 on 3rd and 10th February, Dalhousie 1G16 ITS 3

 

Protein Sequence Analysis

The aim of this workshop is to give an understanding of how best to use computational methods to &amp;quot;make sense&amp;quot; of the structure and function of your favourite protein. The workshop will introduce the principles of sequence analysis and its relationship to protein structure and function. It will highlight common methods and tools for protein sequence analysis and multiple sequence alignment will be explained. The workshop will include hands-on examples of methods that exploit evolutionary information to predict structural features from sequence and to identify functionally important residues by sub-family analysis.

Prerequisites: 'Multiple Sequence Alignment and Analysis with Jalview'. If you can, please bring a well-specified laptop with you to the session and make sure it runs Jalview.

It is used by scientists to compare the sequences of molecules from different species in order to understand their function. Jalview also allows information from thousands of different databases to be combined and visualised in a convenient way on the sequences. Jalview is used by scientists in Academia and Industry from almost all areas of biological science and its application. During the course of this grant 14 new releases (versions) of the software were developed and made available for free use by anyone. In addition, 20 training courses were run in order to introduce the software to new users and to explain the more advanced features. The web site (www.jalview.org) was substantially updated to provide rich new information about the software. As a result of these developments, the number of people using Jalview grew from around 32,000 to over 55,000. This growth is reflected in the 2,500 citations that the 2009 publication about Jalview has so far received and the wide range of biological research that has been facilitated by the software.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Jalview is a tool that is widely used by the biological research community. The new developments to Jalview, the training courses and materials that were made possible by this grant have already enabled many other scientists to advance their research.
