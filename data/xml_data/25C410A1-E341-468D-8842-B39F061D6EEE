Recent research suggests that the amygdala is important for processing emotional cues. Both an under and over-reactive amygdala could make an individual more likely to engage in antisocial and aggressive behaviour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We already know that the amygdala of children with callous-unemotional traits is under-active when they view pictures of other people looking fearful. This could mean that instead of their amygdala signaling that they are causing distress to someone else, it is 'telling' them nothing at all. Alternatively, it may mean that children with callous-unemotional traits are just not paying attention to relevant information in fearful faces, such as the eye region. It has also been speculated that children who engage in 'hot-headed' antisocial behaviour, but have the capacity to empathise, could suffer from an over-active amygdala that makes them vulnerable to react aggressively to anything they see as a threat. None of these speculations had been formally evaluated previously.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project investigated these issues and provided more information about the emotion processing profiles associated with different subtypes of children with antisocial behaviour.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>400793</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What are children with conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits made of?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>13AC67B0-1B8C-41C9-A134-338B6AAA6280</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Psychopathy is an adult diagnosis comprised of both callous-unemotional personality traits (lack of empathy and guilt) and overt antisocial behaviour.

Researchers are becoming increasingly aware of different pathways to similar problem behaviours. Children with callous-unemotional traits lack empathy and display low responsiveness to other people's distress. Their conduct problems are often severe, premeditated and persistent. These trait and behavioural characteristics are similar in some ways to hose seen in adult psychopaths.

We can employ different methodologies to investigate the vulnerabilities that characterize children with high levels of callous-unemotional traits. Research from our on lab and that of other researchers has, for example, examined cognitive-affective, biological and environmental vulnerabilities. Children with conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits have reduced sensitivity to visual or vocal displays of distress emotions and poor modulation of behavior in response to punishment. Recent neuroimaging work has begun to elucidate the pattern of neural vulnerabilities associated with high levels of callous-unemotional traits, including low amygdala activity to other people's distress. Genetically informative studies suggest that callous-unemotional traits (and conduct problems in the presence of these traits) are highly heritable. High heritability does not, however, denote immutability and callous-unemtotional traits can change over time. The challenge is to understand how biological and cognitive vulnerabilities to callous-unemotional traits can be moderated by environmental factors, such as parenting and structured therapeutic intervention.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1100919769.23953722b18dd1c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Donders Centre for Cognition lectures, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>785F3F52-7380-415F-ABD7-6DC29854411B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk; Conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits in children</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cdd382312ee4.55582384</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conduct Problems and Callous-Unemotional Traits: Genetic and Brain Imaging Findings</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>2DB345B5-C204-4C56-918E-4895DE04332A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Psychopathy is an adult diagnosis comprised of both callous-unemotional personality traits (lack of empathy and guilt) and overt antisocial behaviour.

One can also find children who exhibit callous-unemotional subtype of antisocial behaviour and who are at an increased risk for developing psychopathy. Research from our lab and others has documented that callous-unemotional traits are heritable. More interestingly, when we study subgroups of antisocial children with/without callous-unemotional traits, we find strong genetic influence on antisocial behaviour in the former group, but not in the latter. Our finding supports the view that children at risk for psychopathy form a distinct subgroup with a genetic vulnerability to antisocial behaviour and I will present some preliminary genome-wide association data relating to this group of children. 



Genetic vulnerability may underlie neurocognitive &amp;quot;abnormalities&amp;quot; associated with psychopathic traits. I will provide a brief overview of data from our and other labs investigating neurocognitive correlates of callous-unemotional traits. Our on-going research combines behaviour genetic and brain imaging methodologies and these efforts will be discussed at the end of the talk.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4142960369.72008662b18afe0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Joseph Lister Award Lecture: Why Do Some People Become Psychopaths?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>7551555D-3304-4B7A-9D85-8870D60B9B14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Psychopaths have callous and unemotional personality traits, and often engage in criminal and antisocial activities.
