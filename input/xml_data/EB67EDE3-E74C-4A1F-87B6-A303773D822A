The cost of generating energy from offshore wind farms in the UK is currently too high to make it truly cost competitive with traditional fossil fuel energy generation techniques. The aim of the research outlined in this proposal is to determine if a novel offshore wind energy concept can reduce the cost of generating offshore wind energy by up to 30%, making offshore wind energy in the UK truly cost competitive with traditional fossil fuel generation.

This novel wind turbine, known as the X-Rotor, is a multi-megawatt wind turbine concept aimed at large-scale offshore commercial deployment. Early analyses have suggested that the X-Rotor has the potential to reduce offshore wind turbine capital costs by up to 20%, O&amp;amp;M costs by up to 40% and also offer savings in wind farm balance of plant costs. The novel X-Rotor concept was an awardee of the Royal Academy of Engineering ERA Award in 2016. Further analysis must be completed on aerodynamic, structural and control aspects of the X-Rotor design to determine if it is feasible for adoption and full development by an existing or new offshore wind turbine manufacturer. O&amp;amp;M cost modelling must also be completed to confirm the significant offshore O&amp;amp;M savings. 
 
The team completing the feasibility study have existing relationships with key executives in all of the major wind turbine manufacturers who will be consulted throughout this feasibility study. In particular, interaction is expected with Vestas (one of the largest wind turbine manufacturers in the world) who's &amp;quot;Innovation and Concept&amp;quot; department has already been consulted on the development of the X-Rotor and who are eager to hear more about the concept upon completion of the feasibility study.

If the proposed feasibility study for X-Rotor concept proves it to be a feasible technology the potential for significant impact exists due to the applicants close relationship with all of the major wind turbine manufacturers and those manufacturers desire for a step change in the cost of generating electricity from offshore wind.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The academic beneficiaries and impact of this research has been discussed in the &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; of this application. This section will outline the beneficiaries and impact of this research outside of academia. If this research proves the X-Rotor to be feasible and commercial development follows the X-Rotor has potential to benefit:
- Electricity End Users. The X-Rotor has the potential to reduce the cost of generating electricity from offshore wind by up to 30%. If this 30% cost saving was passed to the electricity end user they would eventually benefit from this research. The continued growth of offshore wind energy within the UK's energy mix will see this 30% saving in cost have a greater impact as a growing number of offshore wind turbines are installed.
- Offshore Wind Farm Developers. The cost of the wind turbine is one of the major costs for offshore wind farm developers. If this research proves feasible the developer could see a saving of up to 20% in turbine cost.
- Offshore Wind Farm Operators. The cost of operating and maintaining wind farms offshore is greater than onshore due to the requirement for costly maintenance vessel. The X-Rotor has potential to operate without the most expensive Jack-up vessel. Along with a predicted lower failure rate than conventional turbine it is expected that Offshore wind farm operators could see a maintenance cost saving of up to 40% in comparison to existing offshore wind turbines.
- Offshore Wind Turbine Manufacturers. Like the wind turbine developers, the manufacturers of offshore wind turbine will see a great impact on their overall costs if they can manufacture the X-Rotor for 20% less cost than their existing offshore wind turbines.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>117991</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R001472/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
