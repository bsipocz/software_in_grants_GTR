Working closely with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and world-leading research institutions in North America and mainland Europe, the project will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Synthesise existing evidence on barriers and enablers affecting the implementation of Animal Health and Welfare (AHW) best practice&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Identify and examine successful examples of best practice co-production, communication and adoption (including state-sponsored advice, private advisory agencies and extension services) focussing on transferrable lessons from other sectors, international case studies and specific examples from individual livestock sectors in the UK&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Undertake a programme of empirical work to 'follow' the chain of best practice from the issuer of guidance/regulation (public, private or third sector organisation), via key actors in the information supply chain, to individual on-farm practice. Bovine tuberculosis will be used as the focus for the research&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Communicate the findings to a wide range of stakeholders in government and the farming industry, informing policy and practical interventions to enhance AHW management.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The direct beneficiaries of the research will be the Animal and Plant Health Evidence and Analysis (APHEA) team and bovine tuberculosis (bTB) policy team within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Additional indirect benefits will accrue for Defra as a whole in the sharing of best practice between departments and the provision of training in innovative social science research methods for both social researchers and policy teams. Key stakeholder organisations will also be interested and potentially benefit from the empirical phases of the research; in particular, through the deployment of social network analysis in identifying key nodes and routes for knowledge exchange. 

APHEA and bTB policy: This FRL fellowship will feed directly into the evidence and analysis-base for bovine tuberculosis, integrating social research understandings and methodologies into the policy-making process. The policy and evidence teams will benefit from understanding the social practices inherent in farmer decision-making and the translation of 'best practice' into 'farm practice'; it will provide critical evidence on communication strategies and effective use of knowledge 'brokers', leading to the development of new and improved communication tools, and the barriers and enablers to adopting certain practices/regulations on-farm. The applicant's knowledge of the policy context and previous experience of close working with these evidence and policy teams means that the benefits will start to accrue immediately; arguably, the translation of research into policy and practice will be more effective and more immediate than 'external' academic recommendations. Anticipated long-term impacts include an increase in the understanding and use of more diverse and innovative social research methodologies within Defra's evidence and analysis (internally and in commissioning academic research). This will be achieved via the provision of a number of co-training opportunities, organised by the applicant. Specifically, social network analysis has been employed within the Department of Justice and the Home Office, but has been largely absent from Defra's evidence and analysis. 

Government agencies: Those agencies employed to provide predominantly natural science evidence (e.g. FERA and AHVLA) will benefit from receiving presentations and summary documents on project findings. Specifically, the FRL fellowship has the indirect benefit of embedding understandings of what social science is, the methodologies that are available and the questions that can be asked and answered to generate socially-informed research to respond to complex sustainability challenges. Natural science colleagues within government agencies (where social science is largely absent) and within academic institutions will benefit through a greater ability to cultivate more informed and 'successful' interdisciplinary research collaborations based upon greater understandings of social science approaches and methodologies. 

Industry: Industry organisations, including the NFU, breed societies and veterinary practices will benefit from a greater understanding of knowledge transfer and their role in that process. For example, the NFU have recently re-established their network of 'county advisors' to reengage with the needs of their membership; an understanding of social practices and the social networks via which information is transferred and adopted would be very valuable in their assessment and approach to this 'reengagement'. There is also the potential for further work to demonstrate the utility of social network analysis in industry information campaigns and in agri-business decision-making and the generation of market intelligence. The applicant proposes to assess the potential for translating social network analysis into industry and business applications, leading to the preparation of a 'follow-on' fund application in the final year of the fellowship.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>248106</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tesco Plc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Antimicrobial resistance</gtr:description><gtr:id>FDF77B14-BA3A-464F-9F39-AFB164A97682</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Application (unsuccessful) to ESRC Tackling antimicrobial resistance: behaviour within and beyond the healthcare setting funding call

The PI developed a review of social scientific research on understanding and influencing farmer behaviour for the Animal Health and Welfare directorate within Defra. This work is being considered as a potentially case study by the Policy Profession within Defra as a model for integrated academic research from the social sciences into practical policy making outcomes. The outputs have already been used to inform policy on how to engage with the Private Veterinary Profession and has created the basis for designing interventions on biosecurity interventions, currently being developed with the Behavioural Insights Team. A workshop was also convened bringing together policy makers, industry stakeholders and academics to set social science research priorities for enhancing animal health and welfare outcomes and an interactive policy workshop is being convened in March 2017 to embed learnings from the social sciences into animal health and welfare policy development. The PI also provided the research and wrote a report that underpinned a government-industry owned TB Biosecurity Action Plan. To maximise the ongoing benefits accruing from the fellowship, the PI has taken forward a number of complementary actions from the Action Plan, including preparing a summary of the evidence underpinning the TB biosecurity 5 Point Plan (used widely within industry and published on the government-industry website (www.tbhub.co.uk) and developing a new TB biosecurity innovation plan, which challenged farmers, industry and academia to create solutions to on-farm biosecurity issues (via 'biosecurity 'hacks').

Theoretical and methodological development:
Previous social scientific research on animal health and welfare (and specifically bovine tuberculosis) has tended to focus on the attitudes and behaviours of individual farmers and animal keepers. Whilst useful, this approach does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the wider influences on disease management on farms. This research has contributed to broadening the research and policy focus through providing an understanding of the role that wider biophysical (e.g. the constraints of existing farm buildings and infrastructure) and social (e.g. skills, knowledges, norms, policies) factors play in guiding efforts to improve animal health and welfare. In addition to helping policy makers and practitioners understand the importance of recognising and addressing these wider issues, the research has sought to proactively identify and generate solutions to these challenges. This culminated in a series of on-farm biosecurity events ('hacks') which brought together farmers, vets, policy makers, engineers and designers to co-design practical processes and prototype products that would be workable and effective in an on-farm environment. Policy makers and practitioners (mainly farmers and vets) have been involved at each stage of the research, ensuring that they benefited from research activities and findings throughout the duration of the project. 

Notable policy developments include:
1. Development of a bovine TB Biosecurity Action Plan: The PI designed and lead-facilitated a workshop (in collaboration with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) for 45 stakeholders in May 2014 to explore the factors influencing the implementation of biosecurity measures. The workshop report, authored by the PI, formed the basis of discussions to develop the joint Defra and industry Biosecurity Action Plan for Improving Herd Resilience to bovine TB, published 18th December 2014. During the course of the fellowship, the PI has contributed to the delivery of a number of complementary actions from the Action Plan, including preparing a summary of the evidence underpinning the TB biosecurity 5 Point Plan (used widely within industry and published on the government-industry website (www.tbhub.co.uk) and developing a new TB biosecurity innovation plan, which challenged farmers, industry, policy makers, designers, engineers and academia to create solutions to on-farm biosecurity issues (via biosecurity 'hacks').
2. 
Improved use of social science research in policy development: A series of slide packs (co-designed with policy leads in Defra's Animal Health and Welfare Directorate) have been developed to provide an accessible resource for policy-makers and industry stakeholders, summarising the key learnings from social science research on Animal Health and Welfare. The resources cut across the cattle, sheep, pig, poultry and equine sectors and provide 'top level findings' as well as an accompanying resource detailing the evidence sources. The project has received cross-directorate interest within Defra and is being considered as a template for the policy profession in bringing academics and policy makers together to create better evidence-based policy. The packs have been shared with and used by government agencies (e.g. the Animal and Plant Health Agency, Natural England, The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science) and key stakeholder organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The slide packs developed for policy will provide a resource for both policy makers and academics. They provide an accessible summary of the research which helps to overcome the challenges of poor institutional memory and establishes research priorities that can inform future developments in animal health and welfare. 

The set of challenges and potential solutions identified as part of the research and during the on-farm biosecurity events ('hacks') will help to inform future policy and research priorities. These challenges will be included in Defra's research and development call for financial year 2017/18.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0B0B0587-F32A-430C-B65F-8676A6A1338F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df15538c7683.29287106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Workshop report as basis for TB Biosecurity Action Plan Development</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C9F1A95-03DB-41B2-B07B-140C22799F1C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546df91e4ee721.58100788</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cattle-biosecurity-action-plan-for-improving-herd-resilience-to-bovine-tb</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of Defra project board for the development of new Strategy to Achieve Officially TB Free Status for England (released April 2014).</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EDE5C78-2725-45F5-808A-849608A93243</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved the strategic direction of the policy.

The aim is to overcome issues of difficulties in retaining institutional memory.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2E596C29-F3AC-4744-98A3-8C7B28AA2B10</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project has received cross-directorate interest within Defra and is being considered as a template for the policy profession in bringing academics and policy makers together to create better evidence-based policy. The packs have been shared with government agencies (e.g. the Animal and Plant Health Agency, Natural England, The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science) and key stakeholder organisations across the livestock sectors.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca501174c161.98444483</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Slide packs for policy</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6AF07186-67E8-4916-8814-5D7D65043CA1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Developing a risk-based trading scheme for cattle in England: farmer perspectives on managing trading risk for bovine tuberculosis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Veterinary record</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7a310aa38fc07d1ed3ca2c795e1a9f84"><gtr:id>7a310aa38fc07d1ed3ca2c795e1a9f84</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Little R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0042-4900</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c8ec3c1c3278.57010779</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1EA9F980-AB45-42EB-B2BD-F270DC383136</gtr:id><gtr:title>The 'Good Farmer': Farmer Identities and the Control of Exotic Livestock Disease in England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociologia Ruralis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4cf8a023f095a6f249463737e490c239"><gtr:id>4cf8a023f095a6f249463737e490c239</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Naylor R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c95d9009e619.78832328</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>27F2B542-F6B5-4062-93A1-56F5D8891D47</gtr:id><gtr:title>Doing more with less</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Britain in 2016 (Magazine published by UK Economic &amp;
