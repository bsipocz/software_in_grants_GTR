In this project, we will work together in eight diverse and overlapping AHRC Connected Communities - academic networks, civil society organizations, online communities, and groups rooted in physical neighbourhoods - to co-develop creative ways of identifying, evaluating and enhancing intangible, values-related aspects of project legacies. The question of legacy is closely connected to the values of different stakeholders, yet these values are rarely discussed openly, and many are not considered measurable in tangible ways. As a result, traditional evaluations tend to reflect the values of donors or governments, and what can be easily measured, rather than considering what project partners may be striving to achieve. 

This project is innovative in bringing out unheard voices and legacies and giving them authority, by bringing together three emerging strands of interdisciplinary research. One is the co-development of creative and arts-based research methodologies which can enable different knowledges and 'ways of knowing' to be understood (e.g. visual, theatrical). Another is the use of a values lens for the local elicitation of appropriate indicators, frameworks or entire evaluation systems that allow locally important, 'intangible' outcomes to be clarified and effectively communicated. The third is an exploration of new forms of authority that are not derived from static laws or structures, but from sources of creativity. A careful, critical and reflective synthesis of these three strands will enable us to co-map less tangible legacies and pathways of influence for CC projects, making them 'quasi-objective' rather than subjective, and granting them legitimacy and authority in wider political and policy arenas. In so doing, we will be developing an approach that may provide the same, much needed, service in several other arenas such as sustainability, civil society and values based management.

The research will use a structure of five collaborative events, building an iterative and reflective cycle into the research process. We are a consortium of academic and community partners with extensive combined experience in co-design, critical approaches to participatory research, and innovative research methodologies. We will develop locally relevant and rigorous evaluation approaches to explore, crystallise and articulate self-defined 'intangible legacies' through workshops for some, and a retreat for others. We will draw on different arts and humanities scholarship, exploring, for instance, the importance of material expressions of authority, and the transformative and informative role of co-created visual arts. In such ways, we will build up shared understandings of what is important to us, and in the process making it more locally measurable. This will enhance our ability to communicate our deeply-held priorities, focus future work effectively, build on the legacy of recent projects, and influence wider arenas of policy and practice. Our approach will contribute to enhancing CC legacies rather than merely documenting them, in that increased awareness of the identified valued legacies will cause them to be supported further. It will also support the creation of new networks and enable and empower participants in these projects to themselves become co-designers of values-based evaluation systems.

Our community co-investigators will lead on developing and embedding similar evaluative approaches in at least six other Connected Communities projects, both in order to test the generalizability of the new approaches, and to facilitate project partners to become (vernacular) designers of values-focused evaluation systems. We will share our findings with the wider Connected Communities programme and achieve wide dissemination through information packs, multimedia production and a public showcase event.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While the initial impetus for the co-development of this bid came from the AHRC-CC Workshop held in Edinburgh in July 2013, the proposed research strongly responds to the felt needs of participating community organizations. Community co-investigators, separately and prior to this bid, had already been reflecting on ways of evaluating some of the less tangible legacies associated with completed and ongoing CC projects. In particular, aspects such as the nature of relationships between academic and community partners were felt to be beyond the realm of conventional evaluation - even if they were experienced as one of the most distinctive and rewarding aspects of CC work. 

In this respect, the proposed research will generate a substantial and lasting impact at individual, interpersonal and collective levels within the specific organizations (and networks) whose senior managers are participating as Co-Investigators. At the individual level, it will move beyond a 'training' or 'capacity building' approach to one that seeks actively to empower the participating CCIs as vernacular designers of values-based, context-appropriate monitoring and evaluation systems for completed and ongoing CC projects. (This will result not only in enhanced participation in co-design, but also in meta-design, i.e. sustainable infrastructuring of appropriate values-based monitoring and evaluation systems within the participating organizations.) At the interpersonal level, we anticipate improved group dynamics and a strengthening of professional relationships both within and between organizations. We further expect that CCIs, acting in the capacity of chief executives / directors of the respective organizations, will actively use the learning from the project to make changes in organizational policy, strategic decision-making and practice. These collective-level changes, arising from an increased understanding of which intangible outcomes are important to CCIs and to other key stakeholders, will contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the respective organizations in relation to localized values-based criteria. 

Beyond this initial circle of direct participants (primary arena of influence), the research - like the CC projects it seeks to evaluate - will generate a 'ripple effect' across multiple arenas. One such arena is represented by wider communities of interest, locality and practice that have already been involved with the CC programme, and thus have much to gain from understanding the intangible legacies of the programme (especially in relation to values) and their implications for policy and practice. In the case of Scaling Up Co-Design, for example, these include community centres and activist groups in London where The Glass House has tested and used the `Design by Consensus' methodology; a group of formerly marginalised young people who have been trained and empowered as community journalists and film-makers by Silent Cities in Sheffield; and online communities of people with disabilities, and of women working in information and communication technologies (Blackwood Foundation and Fossbox respectively). 

The flexible and highly collaborative structure of this research is intended to create opportunities for networking and direct collaborations between wider-arena beneficiaries and the core project steering group. Most of these connections will be emergent rather than predesigned; but as a specific example, we have committed resources to sub-contract the Silent Cities community journalists to produce a short documentary film highlighting some of the intangible legacies identified during the project. The film will form part of the final 'showcase' event in February 2015; yet the processes of making it may be as important as the output itself, contributing to self-esteem, income-generation, and skill development through practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>110013</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An audio podcast was created by Julian Brigstocke from recordings of 'walk and talk' activities at an August 2014 retreat for participants in two AHRC-funded projects (Immanent Authority and the Making of Community and Community Authority, Performance and Knowledge in Participatory Practice), all of whom were members of the Authority Research Network.</gtr:description><gtr:id>07936502-A20B-4F2E-86C2-DA50CFFA45A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No impacts yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddff520fd3a0.51783999</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Audio podcast - Authority Research Network</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>MindGenius mind-maps with attached evidence, such as photographs and audio files, have been produced to document the values and legacies of some of the Scaling-Up community partner organisations (Silent Cities, the Blackwood Foundation) and the Authority Research Network.

Participants gained a better understanding of what matters to them within the project and how their values are 'lived out' in practice. This revealed important aspects of the project that had previously been overlooked. Using the values-based indicators developed through the 'Starting from Values' project helped participants to realise the importance of intangible dimensions such as being able to laugh and have fun together, which are not usually evaluated but without which they would find it very difficult to work together and make progress.

In evaluation, the 'outcomes' of a project tend to be described from only one viewpoint, rather than taking different people's perspectives into account. Thus, a project report will usually include a list or description of outcomes that is presented as if it were a simple statement of facts. We have discovered through this research, however, that project outcomes are valued differently by the different project participants, according to their personal and professional values and goals. Thus, an outcome that is of enormous significance to a university partner - such as a publication in a high-impact academic journal, which is later cited by many other researchers - may be of no relevance at all to a community partner. 

In the same way, there is often a bias in the evaluation and reporting of collaborative research projects, in favour of outcomes that are of strategic importance to funders. In effect, the values and priorities of the funders are given authority over those of other project stakeholders. What this means is that outcomes that are crucially important to community partners and other less powerful stakeholders, such as project beneficiaries, may be overlooked in traditional evaluations: their voices, and their distinctive understandings of what the project has brought them, go unreported. The legacy of a funded research project, from the perspective of a specific participant, can be understood as those outcomes and outputs which that particular person finds meaningful, worthwhile or valuable. Thus, just as there can never be a universal definition of what is meaningful, there is also no way of defining the legacies of a project without taking a 'multi-subjective' approach - exploring the issue from different viewpoints.

In this project, we recognised from the start that some aspects of project legacies are harder to capture and document than others. We characterised these initially as 'intangible legacies'. However, another important finding of the project was that legacies can have both tangible and intangible dimensions - e.g. a tangible output such as a book might be the result of a collaborative research process in which deep and genuine friendships were created, resulting in a climate of mutual trust that gave people the courage to share their more creative or 'risky' ideas, leading in turn to new ways of thinking. 

It includes the recognition that `legacy' is not a concept that only has a single, objective definition (unlike `impact', `outcomes', etc.) but rather a multi-subjective one that relates to participants' values. This implies, in turn, a new approach to evaluation that explicitly acknowledges the differing values of multiple stakeholders (e.g. project donors, implementers, beneficiaries and wider society) and recognises that these lead to different understandings of project legacies. In parallel with this advance in the theoretical understanding, we have developed a wide range of methods for eliciting the values of different stakeholders and mapping or tracking the associated legacies of funded collaborative research across a variety of different arenas.

*Note, however, that one of these participants felt that the Starting from Values project had interrupted an existing process of reflection on their work, i.e. the change was a negative one. The other three were very positive and stated that the project had helped them to reflect in new ways.

The theme of presenting our work differently highlighted how the Starting from Values project had changed the ways in which participants communicate their work to wider audiences, engage with the public, or recruit new clients. This was expressed not only in terms of outcomes (changes to websites, new publications, or new approaches to conference presentations) but also the processes of communication. Participants reported, for example, that the project had helped them to make their work useful to other people and apply it to new arenas; that it had made them more conscious of presenting their work in a beautiful way, or trying to create beauty; and, in the case of two community co-investigators, that it had taught them how to present their work in terms of values.

The theme of new ideas, projects and/or activities also included a number of sub-themes within it. At the most tangible level, for Fossbox the SfV work has already led to a formal collaboration on a new funded project (a multi-stakeholder values-focused evaluation of The Exchange, a collaborative research initiative for ECRs and creatives funded by Arts Council England and HEFCE). For other partners, it has led to new activities within a recently launched project: the Empowering Design Practices project (led by two of the academic Co-Is from Starting from Values, Katerina Alexiou and Theo Zamenopoulos) has been designed to incorporate values activities systematically from the start, with follow-up reflection on a regular basis. Other participants are at different stages on this journey: from new ways of thinking, to initial ideas for projects, to emergent or completed proposals for new research (in the case of academic Co-Is) or concrete plans to undertake a specific activity (in the case of community Co-Is). 

Beyond the direct use of project findings, our analysis also highlighted several themes relating to 'intangible dimensions of legacies', or what might be termed 'areas of influence', from the project. These were seeing our work differently; responding to external pressures; personal transformation; new understandings of legacies; new understandings of [our] values; and new understandings of values-based approaches and methodologies. 

- The theme of seeing our work differently had numerous sub-themes. One community Co-I expressed on several different occasions that the project had enabled them to see her work in broader, more holistic and more integrated ways, and to see new relationships between different areas of work. Two community Co-Is, two advisers and one ARN member also felt that the project had led them to reflect on how they work, what they're actually doing (or want to do), who they are as designers, researchers or practitioners, why they are doing what they are (or in the ways that they are), and where their organization is going. Two participants said that they valued their work more, and two others said that the SfV project helped to expose unaddressed issues and challenges - providing insights into why some aspects of previous projects had 'worked' and others had not, in one case, and enabling potential communication difficulties to be exposed and addressed at the pilot stage of a project rather than waiting for them to get worse, in the other. Other comments made by individuals that were grouped under the seeing our work differently theme were having a clearer sense of vision and identity, and seeing important things that had been 'lost' in the way that people worked (e.g. due to the pressures of time).
- On a similar note, the theme of responding to external pressures also emerged as important for several participants, from two contrasting perspectives. Some participants (notably in the Authority Research Network) stated that the project had served as a reminder of what was important to them, e.g. friendship, 'slow thinking' or a process focus, and helped them not to compromise these values when under pressure to produce outputs. They also referred to creating spaces to think, connect, care for each other, and support each other through difficult times. From the opposite perspective, some participants felt that SfV's focus on positive values and creativity had contributed to a depoliticisation of the 'legacy' landscape, i.e. responding to external pressures with a mind-set of ignoring or even denying wider political and economic contexts. The legacy discourse could also be seen as buying into a market-led culture, or acceding to market-driven demands for communication of 'success' and 'impact'. Likewise, the drive to 'make the intangible tangible' might serve to bring ever more domains of human experience into the realm of quantification and depersonalisation and reinforce entrenched power dynamics. 

- Comments under the theme of personal transformation were made by eight participants altogether: three of the four Community Co-Is, two project advisers, two research assistants and an ARN member. All but one of these related to positive affect outcomes (feeling energised, empowered, intrigued, inspired, affirmed or reassured); competencies (building up experience, knowledge and confidence, taking on new roles e.g. as a facilitator, or rethinking a career path); and social outcomes (new friendships and a 'reminder to be friendly'). By contrast, one participant felt that SfV had a negative effect on certain relationships and had undermined trust.

- New understandings of legacies was divided into three overarching sub-themes, namely (a) participants recognising new forms, types or dimensions of legacy that they had not previously thought about; (b) participants finding new ways of relating to their project legacies in a general sense; and (c) participants identifying specific new project legacies that they had not previously recognised, some of which (e.g. energy and creativity) overlapped with the `personal transformation' legacies of the SfV project itself. The contributions in each of these sub-themes are listed below:

o New forms, types or dimensions of legacy: cascading legacies; intangible legacies; legacies that are not immediate, or would not be picked up by an end-of-project evaluation; legacies that are not captured in project outputs, such as publications or reports; deeply personal legacies; and legacies that were previously unspoken, or simply 'had not occurred to people' as legacies.

o New ways of relating to project legacies: recognising, exploring and articulating legacies; valuing or valorising legacies, or seeing specific legacies as essential to the project, going forward; building on legacies in other contexts.

o Specific legacies identified through the SfV project: confidence, 'cross-pollination / cross-fertilisation' (i.e. exchange of methods and tools between projects or organisations), creativity, credibility, energy and vitality, empowerment, experimentation, exploration of ideas with beneficiaries in a safe space, friendship, joy, new languages for articulating values, making time for people, strengthening of networks, challenging power dynamics, ownership and creative commons, rebalancing life and work, reciprocity, relationship-building, slow thinking, trust; also new knowledge, ways of thinking, partnerships, products, tools and ways of teaching.

- New understandings of values encompasses the sub-themes of articulating, exploring and clarifying values at the individual, project and organisational levels; reinforcing a project's driving values; developing values frameworks and using them for planning and evaluation; revising organisational values statements or creating new ones; recognising where values are shared between partners in a project, or not; giving people more confidence to talk about their values or what's important to them; and talking about differences in values within a project team or organisation. We note the emergence of two contrasting trends: one leading towards consensus, often in the form of a material artefact like a mutually agreed values framework, and the other towards dissensus (not necessarily negative) and a recognition of intra-organisational / intra-project diversity in values.

- New understandings of values-focused based approaches encompasses three main sub-themes: (a) recognising the potential usefulness of values-based approaches (as practiced in this project), and/or developing new approaches, for new contexts; (b) identifying challenges with values-based approaches, and (c) gaining practical experience in how to facilitate and deliver values-based approaches. In the first category, there was a recognition that values-based approaches could be useful not only for articulating and capturing a range of legacies, and for more formal evaluation processes and communications with funders, but also at the design and planning stages of projects. Participants suggested that values-based approaches could be helpful for catalysing new kind of dialogue about partners' interests and priorities; freeing up new ways of thinking and acting (e.g. not restricting themselves to partners working on similar thematic areas); bringing people together and building relationships on the basis of shared values; building a shared vision and identity within a group; and/or moving beyond tensions and frustrations to focus on what people collectively found important. There were also some suggestions that values-based approaches could be useful for challenging power dynamics and advocating for a new form of politics. In the second category, however, it was noted that values-based approaches often run the risk of reinforcing existing power dynamics and can have a depoliticising effect, sometimes serving to marginalise concerns about the wider political or economic environment and its effects on the partner organisations. Finally, in the third category, an important impact of the project was the capacity building of some partners as facilitators of values-based workshops in their own right.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- Project design and strategic thinking (including identifying and mitigating potential values conflicts at early stages of project design)
