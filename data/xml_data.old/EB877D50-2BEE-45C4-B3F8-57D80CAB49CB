The functionality of a traditional photonic device is usually realized by reshaping the wavefront of the light that relies on gradual phase changes along the optical paths, which are accomplished by either controlling the surface topography or varying the spatial profile of the refractive index. The thickness of photonic devices usually remains comparable to the wavelength of the light. However, further reduction in the thickness of the corresponding element is hindered by the design theory since it is based on phase accumulation along the optical path. Metamaterials can usually be engineered to exhibit electromagnetic properties that may not be found in nature or its constituent components, thus providing an unconventional alternative to optical design. Metasurfaces, the emerging field of metamaterials, which consist of a single layer of artificial &amp;quot;atoms&amp;quot;, have recently captured the attention of the scientific community since they do not require complicated three-dimensional nano-fabrication techniques but can control light propagation in equally dramatic ways. Unlike the phase change by the accumulated optical path in traditional optical elements, the abrupt phase change takes place at the metasurfaces, meaning that a new freedom for controlling light propagation is introduced. Metasurfaces promise a whole variety of amazing applications, e.g. ultrathin metalens, spin-hall effect of light and spin controlled photonics. Recently, the PI and his collaborators have experimentally observed several new interesting phenomena connected with the phase discontinuities occurring at the metasurfaces: i) 3D optical holography ii) broadband vortex beam generator iii) dual-polarity ultrathin metalenses and iv) polarization dependent unidirectional surface plasmon polariton excitation. These findings are still under investigation and promise new exciting applications: such as simultaneous multiplane imaging, 3D optical holography with switchable reconstructed images and a waveguide based optical switch. 

The proposal aims to expand our initial findings into a research programme based on my current competitive advantage in exploration of phase discontinuities at metasurfaces. I will design and fabricate plasmonic nanoantennas and elucidate phase discontinuities on the metasurfaces. The main focus of this research will be 1) to design and construct a state-of-the-art optical measurement system to characterize metasurface devices, 2) to elucidate the nature of phase discontinuities and tailor metaurfaces with unusual functionalities, 3) to engineer and fabricate plasmonic metasurfaces and 4) to experimentally demonstrate the prototype devices for simultaneous multiplane imaging, 3D optical holography with switchable reconstructed images and waveguide based optical switch. I plan not only to fabricate new plasmonic metasurfaces and study their extraordinary optical properties but also to assess their applications, which I believe are the most promising and within my expertise. It is the PI's expertise in nanofabrication, plasmonic metasurface and proof-of-concept demonstration which forms the basis of this proposal. It represents a timely and challenging adventure as this proposal is a synergetic integration of fundamental science, nano material/structure design, and prototype device development, which will impact a wide range of fields such as imaging, communication, encryption, information handling and data storage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The technology output from this research could develop beyond and extend across a wide range of areas: from physics to engineering. Outcomes from the programme outlined here will considerably impact plasmonics, nanophotonics, information optics and optical communications and serve to further integrate them. This wide spectrum of interest highlights the importance of the work proposed here. My results will be important first and foremost for the academic community. The theory of the phase discontinuities at the plasmonic metasurfaces will be useful for nanooptics and photonics. The new metamaterials based on nanoantennas will be stimulating and important for metamaterial community. Moreover, the phase discontinuity based plasmonic devices could useful for optoelectronics. We hope to widen understanding of the relevant physics, clarify the mechanisms of the studied effects and to check them by direct experiments. 

To date the majority of metamaterial research has been conducted from a fundamental science perspective, but it is now at the crucial point where the knowledge accumulated over last decade has reached the critical mass that would generate a host of future high-impact technological applications. Successful completion of this research project would lead to the invention and development of exciting new ultrathin devices with novel functionalities which will be interesting for industry and technology. One of the important areas that this project can impact is biomedicine. The metadevices for simultaneous multiplane imaging is able to image simultaneously several layers within an object field, which is desirable for biomedical imaging. By collaborating with Prof. A.H. Greenaway from the Institute of Biological chemistry, Biophysics &amp;amp; Bioengineering, this unique imaging technique can attract the attention of biomedical companies. Also, a new freedom, circular polarization is introduced to realize the switchable reconstructed images, which can have an immediate impact in security and anti-counterfeiting. Prof. M.R. Taghizadeh (diffractive optics) has established links with industry on optical holographic techniques, any progress in this work will attract the attention of these companies through collaboration. Finally, the waveguide based optical switch is very useful for optical communications. In principle, the suggested research can result in more compact optical system due to high-level integration. By working closely with Research and Enterprise Services in Heriot-Watt University, research findings will be evaluated for commercialization potential. The economic and societal impact will be apparent within 10 years.

Plasmonic metasurface is a multidisciplinary research area, which can lead to training highly qualified scientific workforce and future researchers who will preserve and enhance UK's international technological competitiveness. The broader impact of this project goes far beyond what we can envisage today, which will surely benefit UK on a variety of fields such as imaging, communication, encryption, information handling and data storage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>87051</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Renishaw plc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Renishaw</gtr:description><gtr:id>579A3674-78C4-40C0-A55A-EB9D3A376C3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has led to one paper published in Advanced Optical Materials

Here, we would like to highlight our achievements in image-switchable hologram and superposition of twisted light beams in multiple channels.

Image-switchable metasurface hologram: With the rapid development in nanotechnology and the unprecedented capabilities of manipulating light in a desirable manner by using man-made nanostructures, the conventional concept of what constitutes an optical hologram continues to evolve. To date, all the demonstrated polarization-controlled nanostructure holograms suffer from either low efficiency or poor image quality. The experimental demonstration of visible frequency nanostructure holograms with broadband optical response has been a significant challenge due to the high plasmonic loss and difficulties in high-uniformity nanofabrication. An image-switchable nanostructure hologram capable of achieving high image quality and high efficiency has been experimentally demonstrated in the broadband (visible and near infrared). The designed nanostructure hologram features the combination of two sets of hologram patterns operating with opposite circular polarizations. A 16level phase hologram in the reflection mode is realized by patterning sub-wavelength metallic nanorods with spatially varying orientations on the SiO2 interlayer and the ground silver plane. The hologram is designed to display two symmetrically distributed off-axis images with high fidelity and a field of view of 64.7 degrees. The images are interchangeable by controlling the polarization of the input light.

Superposition of twisted light beams in multiple channels: Light can be twisted like a corkscrew around its axis of travel. This corkscrew of light is called an optical vortex with a dark hole at the center. Based on how many twists the light does in one wavelength, the vortex is given a number, called the topological charge. The number can be a positive or negative integer, depending on the direction of the twist. The higher the number of the twist, the faster the light is spinning around the axis. When two twisted light beams meet, they affect each other, which is called superposition of twisted light beams. Currently there are fundamental or technical challenges for current techniques to manipulate superposition of twisted light beams. For example, the currently available experimental system is very complex and bulky, and the aberrations in the system and the misalignment of the optical elements greatly decrease the system performance. To tackle the current challenges, for the first time, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an efficient approach to generate multiple twisted light beams and arbitrarily control their superpositions in different channels.

Although the metasurface devices we developed here are sensitive to polarization states of the incident light, it is worth mentioning that these devices are not reconfigurable metasurface devices.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work has the potential to not only redefine the state of the art in this specific topic, but also trigger the interest of the general public in the science and technology enabled by metamaterials and metasurfaces. The image-switchable hologram paves the way for future practical devices with switchable functionalities that may lead to advances in a wide range of fields such as microscopy, display, security, data storage, and information processing. A new freedom, circular polarization is introduced to realize the polarization multiplexed functionalities, which can have an immediate impact in security and anti-counterfeiting. With the rapid development of hologram technologies, traditional security holograms are not secure any more since they can be easily forged by replicating from a master hologram. The invention of this brand new device will possess a unique advantage over traditional security holograms due to its helicity multiplexed functionalities. The performance of the developed device on the multichannel superposition of twisted light beams in subwavelength resolution, broad spectral band, and compactness renders this technology very attractive for diverse applications in both classical physics and quantum sciences.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>16DB1DEF-5D32-4CF9-8D23-72619FD997B2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d45313556f15.50218686</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information
