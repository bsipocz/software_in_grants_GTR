The aim is find the simplest viable description of the typical large scale behaviour of such systems. For example, there are huge number of air molecules in a room, so that, microscopically, the behaviour of the air in the room is described by all of the positions and velocities of those molecules. This is a vast amount of information. In the large, however, what effectively describes the air is a few parameters, such as the temperature and the pressure, that are specified by averages of particles over small regions of space (that nonetheless contain very many particles). In the rigorous theory of statistical mechanics, we choose a suitable mathematical model of a physical system, and prove how the behaviour of such macroscopic quantities as temperature and pressure arises from the microscopic structure of the system.In this proposal, I am undertaking three related research projects, each of which reflects in some way this theme:I. Phase boundary fluctuation. If oil is injected into still water, it forms into a droplet that makes the total surface tension at the boundary as small as possible. On a finer scale, however, the boundary between the two substances may be random. In a recent series of papers, I have investigated, for a natural mathematical model of two such substances, the geometry of this random boundary. I am proposing to investigate what is universal about this random fluctuation: that is, which elements of this behaviour are shared with a diverse range of other systems. II. Trapping in disordered media.If a charged particle in an electric field moves in an environment populated by occasional obstacles, its progress is liable to be frustrated by traps formed by the obstacles. What is the geometry of the traps that waylay the particle, and to what degree do these traps slow down the walk? Alexander Fribergh and I are carrying out an extensive investigation of a mathematical model of this problem, in which a walker jumps generally in a preferred direction, but makes other random moves as well, on a grid in which some edges are impassible.III. Spatial random permutations.At very low temperatures, helium condenses into a remarkable substance that flows with extreme ease. A mathematical model of repelling random particles is naturally associated to such low-temperature gases. I am planning to investigate how these particles behave in a fashion that, while random, has large scale order, and how this order is related to the special properties of very cool gases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research programme will advance understanding in very challenging problems in probability theory and statistical mechanics. A deeper rigorous understanding of trapping in disordered systems will give insight into the susceptibility of materials to stress. Such an understanding of phase transitions in low-temperature gases may yield a more precise understanding of the temperature at which superfluids form, ultimately benefiting in such fields as materials' technology. I aim to make progress on some of the most challenging of those problems in probability that lie at the interface with condensed matter physics. As such, there will be impact in the development of new tools for tackling these technically demanding problems. The impact of these techniques will be felt in both mathematics and physics, where researchers will have new techniques at their disposal to tackle other major unsolved problems. These aims will entail developing a group of researchers, including several graduate students, to undertake them. Members of the group will become acquainted with a diverse range of mathematical skills and will help to develop these new tools in statistical physics. Students graduating from the vibrant research group that I aim to construct might continue to become experts at the boundary of probability theory and physics, or might work in the financial industry, inventing techniques in stochastic analysis to analyse market fluctuations, or in internet search, developing algorithms that exploit an understanding of the random structure of large-scale systems. I seek to further the collaborative aims of the proposal by expanding a graduate seminar series on spatial random permutations, that I have begun to organise in Oxford with James Martin, and by beginning another on critical two-dimensional random systems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>547739</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>New results on self-avoiding walk and KPZ universality.
KPZ universality concerns universal aspects of local random growth, such as the fluctuation behaviour witnessed at the edge of a growing unstable region in a liquid crystal which is disturbed at an initial time by the firing of a laser pulse. The theory has been classically pursued by the use of exactly solvable models, via such techniques as asymptotically analysis of determinantal formulas for correlation functions of systems such as mutually avoiding collections of Brownian bridges. With Ivan Corwin, I developed during the lifetime of the award, in papers concerning the Airy line ensemble and a cousin, the KPZ line ensemble, a probabilistic perspective on KPZ universality, in which exactly solvable features are reinterpreted as probabilistic tools. I have continued to work extensively with these tools since the award ended in an effort to broaden KPZ horizons via probabilistic means. The fruits of my more recent efforts may be found at the end of my webpage, which is indicated elsewhere in these notes.

Self-avoiding walk is a demanding statistical mechanical model of a long chain of monomers in a good solvent, introduced originally by chemists Flory and Orr. Rigorous mathematical results have been rare. I profited from the award by working with Hugo Duminil-Copin and postdoctoral researchers at the University of Geneva, proving new results about this model, such as its sub-ballisticity, or the rarity of the event that the walk ends at or very close to the origin. 

Overall the award was extremely valuable for my professional life, enabling a very strong focus on research at a key time. I would encourage EPSRC to continue supporting five-year grants. In my view, it is better to be open-minded about which field of mathematics may be funded, rather than favouring a particular discipline. And I say this despite probability being so favoured recently. In my view, there is enough excellent research in contemporary probability that strong proposals in this field should attract funding, without it being officially declared that proposals in Statistics and Applied Probability should have priority. This comment applies to other fields as well: it is probably better simply to permit an open competition for grants.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Flexible probabilistic tools in KPZ
