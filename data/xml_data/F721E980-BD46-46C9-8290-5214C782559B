Market: The Magnetometer Immunoassay (MIA) technology developed by the University of the West of England (UWE) promises to be a disruptive diagnostic platform in a broad range of market segments. At the end of the project a robust, cost-effective, flexible and portable platform for testing a range of animal diseases and zoonoses will be brought to the market by Clarity Biosolutions Ltd (CBL) or a licensee.

Society: The outcomes of this project will have significant impact on health and wellbeing by providing a cost-effective, portable platform for testing for foodborne pathogens that will increase monitoring and consequently reduce cases of foodborne illnesses.

Economic: In the short term there will be economic benefits in terms of growth of CBL and investment in new employees. In addition, the economic benefit may be extremely wide as a result of the reduction of UK healthcare burden and cost of foodborne illnesses.

Commercial: A significant by-product of this project will be wider commercial impact through the development and commercialization of a technology for measurement of antibodies and other products based on the MIA platform technology.

Research and Technological: The project will target the development of new assay systems for the Magneto Immunoassay (MIA) technology. This will help to enhance UK's importance in the field of bio-sensing systems. Importantly, it will provide a high-impact demonstration of the technology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>293338</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Clarity BioSolutions</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Clarity Zoonoses Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>B8DAA924-43F1-4849-B88E-5FCF6A48F470</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs include a new prototype technology for detecting diseases in pigs, economic growth of the company and the scientific understanding for development of diagnostic systems for field use.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e2e9a510983.51405117-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Clarity provided input to the design of the consumable particular focusing on ensuring design is appropriate for commercial manufacture</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The research team at UWE has provided the scientific underpinning development of the magnetometer device and the assay system for detection of animal diseases and zoonoses.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bristol Girl Geeks</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F9E02195-9138-4E59-A657-1CE9E199F2B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation aimed at female high tech professionals and academics to raise awareness of new technologies for monitoring animal health.

Measurements have shown that the system is capable of detecting required targets at relevant levels within samples. The aim is for the device to be used in the food and veterinary industries and the technique is unique providing a robust, portable and cost effective system. The partner company is currently progressing the technology towards commercial product and successful implementation will enable early detection of infection and reduce both the risk of infection to humans and the cost burden associated with detection later in the processing pathway. 
The technology developed is a platform that can potential be used in a range of other agri-food applications but also in other fields including healthcare and environmental monitoring.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The aim is to develop a technology that can detect animal disease and zoonoses. The target users for the technology are veterinarians and farmers, although it potentially it could be used others who have an interest in ensuring the health of an animal. The project was focus on 3 key porcine diseases. However the technology could be relatively easily adapted to other animal disease. In the longer term it may be adaptable for home use for pets.
The technology is adaptable to other application areas and the learning within this project can help to accelerate development of the technology for other application areas.
Measurements have been carried out on real samples and although not published currently because of commercial sensitivity. In due course it is intended to make this data available widely available to provide greater understanding of animal diseases and zoonoses.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>507C68DF-C304-4535-8523-2E43E741F291</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545e206d6ac290.93331327</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>MIATech Biosolutions Limited</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>Research and development of products for food safety testing</gtr:description><gtr:id>9099E420-B87E-4344-9233-7DE686B10632</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Better understanding of commercial environment by members of the team who were founders and then for period acted as CEO and CTO of the company.
