A distinguished class of such functions are known as Lipschitz functions. Points where a Lipschitz function fails to behave as an ordinary, differentiable function, form an exceptional &amp;quot;small set&amp;quot; whose nature, though elusive, holds a key to crucial properties of the whole class of Lipschitz functions on a given space. In recent years, these exceptional sets have begun to be extensively studied, but many fundamental questions remain open. The proposed project aims to attack such questions, especially those that concern their geometric properties. For example, a small set may have dimension which is not an integer, which is a common feature of fractals. And indeed, one of the direcions in the proposed research is to capitalize on the most recent advances concerning fractal sets and possibly ergodic theory, and instead of relying on the well-known Hausdorff dimension, find the minimal possible dimension functions which gauge the size of the set in a precise way. The research will also lay the foundations of the geometric theory of curve porous sets, expected to be the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; class of small sets for Lipschitz functions of two or more variables, and obtain precise results on typical differentiability type of Lipschitz functions on a null set in a Euclidean space.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The desire to understand the nature of space, time and motion has always been a driving force behind the development of mathematical analysis. This important branch of mathematics grew out of the ideas of limit and continuity, which date back to Zeno's famous paradoxes, and differentiation, which was invented and applied in physics by Newton. These concepts have made their way, via physics, into science and technology, and their applications continue to have a colossal impact on everyday life and to play a key role in wealth creation and societal progress. To sustain this influence on society and economy, future applications must be fed by new theoretical research conducted today to extend the boundaries of the known. 

The present project is intended to be at the frontier of this research. A central theme of the proposed theoretical research is an investigation of objects called exceptional sets, or small sets, which provide a rigorous mathematical description of anomalies in the behaviour of Lipschitz functions. So, the most immediate impact which the present project is expected to make will be upon an area of mathematical analysis: the advancement of the research which began with the discovery of the small sets, and shedding light on the key questions about these sets which have been open for more than 15 years. 

The project will also have wider impact within mathematics. Indeed, we intend to explore the connection between small sets and fractals, leading to applications within geometry. Another avenue of intradisciplinary impact is via metric measure spaces, which provide a mathematical model of a space with distorted distances and volumes. Also, the theory of small sets has been linked to Baire category theory, hence the project will lead to new concrete examples related to meagre and residual sets. 

At this stage, it is already possible to name several sectors, beyond mathematics, where the research conducted under this project is expected to have a longer-term impact. Lipschitz functions and the chain rule of the differentiation form part of the theoretical base of the study of partial differential equations (PDE) which is crucial for much of the modern physics. In addition, the findings of the project will influence the modern theory of optimal control. This theory has already found numerous applications in engineering, and currently provides mathematical underpinnings of cutting edge technology such as unmanned spacecraft and driverless cars, to say nothing of more day-to-day uses. Furthermore, as is demonstrated in this proposal, differentiability questions motivate new mathematical techniques of working with fractal sets, for example measuring dimensions. Fractal sets are finding new applications: for example, they serve as a mathematical model of tissues, and dimension measurement is important in medical research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>254110</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Warwick</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Physics</gtr:department><gtr:description>University of Warwick</gtr:description><gtr:id>06017ADE-88AF-4DFB-83A7-8FB3BCF5C9F0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results are currently only available as a pre-print.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c667e02684b4.47170086-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The expertise of my collaborator in differentiability along directions from a given cone of directions and intellectual input made it possible a successful collaboration to solve an open question and to generalise results obtained previously by a number of mathematicians.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>My expertise in the Universal differentiability sets and intellectual input made it possible a successful collaboration to solve an open question and to generalise results obtained previously by a number of mathematicians.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N027531/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
