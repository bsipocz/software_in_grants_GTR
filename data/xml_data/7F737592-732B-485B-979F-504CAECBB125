In doing so it examines how printed books and related publications were sites of polemical exchange. The core of the project involves an analysis of 'wonder books', which were produced in great numbers and helped to shape contemporary religious anxieties and debates. These books collated and explained an extraordinary range of natural and supernatural phenomena (earthquakes, 'monstrous' births, terrible signs in the sky, diabolical creatures), and framed them in moralising and often deeply polemical terms. Most significantly, they were tools for Protestants and Catholics to use the astonishing properties of the world around them to create polemical narratives about religious conflict. These books appeared at the same time as other encyclopedic works, including cosmographies and travelogues with information on non-European lands, and demonological treatises on the activities of witches and devils. Wonder books were also closely connected to cheaper broadsheets that reported wondrous and terrifying events as part of a proto-journalistic news culture. 

The project will provide the first substantial analysis of how Protestants and Catholics recycled this sort of printed material across German-, French- and Dutch-speaking Europe - as well as across different religious communities - and in doing so used print in vigorous new ways. In thematic terms this study will explore, for the first time, how these publications collectively reveal increasing anxieties about the devil, witchcraft, and 'heathen' religions beyond Europe's borders, and the ways in which these anxieties shaped European's approaches to religious conflicts on their own doorsteps. Reports of magical but also diabolical practices and objects in Asia, India, the Americas and elsewhere began to appear in European printed publications in the wake of European trade-based and missionary expansion in the sixteenth century. This material intersected with new debates and reports of diabolical witchcraft in Europe, and the whole was set in a broader framework of the extraordinary yet terrifying manifestations of the natural world. In examining this material, the project will provide a new reading of the print culture of wonder books, and their tangible role in constructing and shaping different forms of religious identity in the early modern world. It will explore the extent to which this anxiety about 'others' (witches, demons, and idolatrous heathens) was partly a means of giving polemical voice to religious conflict within Europe. 

Research during the fellowship period will lead to innovative publications in the form of a book-length study as well as an article, and it will form the foundations for a collaborative exhibition project in early 2016 at the John Rylands Library, Manchester. The John Rylands Library is rich in printed and manuscript materials that reflect early modern cultural, intellectual and social preoccupations with magic, the supernatural, and the extraordinary properties of the physical world of Europe and beyond. This exhibition, with associated public events that will engage wide audiences and community groups, will explore how new ideas and experiences in early modern Europe prompted intensive debates about magical, diabolical and supernatural events, and about how to deal with them as individuals and societies. Religious conflicts, scientific developments, legal changes, and encounters with distant lands and peoples led to new ways of reporting, representing and debating magic and related phenomena. The exhibition will explore how beliefs in the power of magic, witchcraft, and associated phenomena persisted and adapted to changes in the early modern world. It will be supported and extended by a publication, an academic symposium, and a range of events for and by the wider public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is structured as a sequence of activities and outcomes designed to cumulatively generate impact. A book and an article aimed primarily at academic audiences will lay the essential preparatory groundwork for an exhibition ('Magic and the Expanding Early Modern World') that will then reach much broader sections of the community. It will have an accompanying publication and a range of public activities intended to actively engage visitors and community groups to generate longer-term benefits. The thematic scope of the exhibition will more broadly generate interest in and debates about the representation and (literal) demonisation of religious groups and practices in the early modern world. Through an accessible but also challenging series of examples, the project will generate particularly useful material for school groups to comparatively discuss religion and cultural difference, thereby creating opportunities to connect the early modern and modern eras in tangible ways. Visitors will also have the opportunity to connect the broader geographical parameters of the exhibition to local events such as the case of the 1612 Lancashire witchcraft trial, as well as John Dee, the occult Renaissance figure associated in significant ways with Manchester. The project will make tangible links between the wider early modern collections held in the city and the history of the region, creating opportunities for local audiences to feel a stronger sense of ownership and for visitors to engage with the cultural resources of the city in new ways. The project is timed to connect with the 2016 Manchester Histories Festival.

Workshops and visitor tours will draw upon new support materials prepared specifically by the exhibition curators, especially Spinks, and this material will form a substantial ongoing resource after the exhibition has closed. A cornerstone of community engagement will be a series of workshops involving 16 to 25 year olds, who will be mentored by Spinks and her colleagues to create a youth-curated online record, hosted by the John Rylands Library, of texts and artworks responding to the themes and objects in the exhibition. Participants will include sixth-form students from inner-city schools and young adults identified through local community youth projects. This aspect of the project will connect the themes of the exhibition with the practical processes of working in a professional or volunteer capacity with early modern print collections, and do so in a way that is relevant to local communities and especially young people. The project will lead to the creation of resources which will help professional and volunteer staff in the collection to work more closely with these aspects of the collections well beyond the life of the exhibition, with the capacity to generate practical and cultural changes that will see these materials engaged with in new ways over the longer term. 

The impact activities will involve close collaboration with a range of professional staff in the John Rylands Library and also additional Manchester collections including Chetham's Library and the Whitworth Art Gallery. This will have ongoing benefits in further developing collaborative models between academics and professional and volunteer staff in cultural collections. The academic symposium at the conclusion of the exhibition will be connected to public lectures by historians during the preceding months. The symposium will include speakers from cultural collections in Manchester, and it will include a session on the ways in which community involvement unfolded during the exhibition, with the aim of further developing reflective approaches to impact activities in future academic activities. The project will therefore benefit and engage a range of groups within the broader community: school children and young adults; wider community audiences; and professional and volunteer staff already working with Manchester's rich cultural resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>126896</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School workshops for exhibition Magic, Witches and Devils in the Early Modern World</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D29B17A9-2446-4500-AF81-C78292E3C359</gtr:id><gtr:impact>c. 55 A-level and GCSE pupils attended 2-hours workshops accompanying the exhibition Magic, Witches and Devils in the Early Modern World.

Between 21 January 2016 and Tuesday 1 March 2016, visitor numbers indicate that it has been seen by 26,503 members of the public, and it is therefore well one track to be seen by over 100,000 people while it is open. 3,000 copies of the accompanying booklet were produced and ran out in the first month; reprinting is currently under discussion. There has been online engagement with wider audiences through blogging, twitter, and several interviews. Social media has been particularly rich, with members of public describing their own and family members' reactions, and retweeting the visual and textual materials prepared to support the exhibition. One mother, for example, described how her young son wanted to read a manuscript on display - the Shahnama, or Persian Book of Kings - and that she planned to locate modern editions for him in several languages. Workshops for A-level and GCSE students has provided another avenue of engagement, with the students enthusiastically discussed key ideas about supernatural beliefs, religious difference, and European encounters with the non-European world.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5C653D4E-4F1D-4179-B241-A0D2445C775F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56db02e610f645.56402034</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The AHRC Early Career Fellowship is still in progress.
