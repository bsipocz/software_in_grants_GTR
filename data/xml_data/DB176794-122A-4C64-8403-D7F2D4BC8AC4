These are algorithms that use random bits to make decisions during their execution. The problems that we propose examining are at the intersection of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, with some connections to statistical physics.Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a particular type of randomized algorithms, and can be used to sample from, and count the number of, some combinatorial structures. One such combinatorial structure that we propose examining are stable matchings, and in particular matchings that arise from the marriage problem, which can be stated as follows: Suppose that we have a set of n men and n women. We assume that each man has a strict preference ordering for the women, and similarly each woman has one for the men. As one would expect, a marriage is a pairing of the men and women so that each is paired with a member of the opposite sex. The marriage is said to be stable if there does not exists a man M and a woman W who prefer each other over their current partners (if this were the case, then M and W would drop their current partners for each other).The stable marriage problem was introduced in 1962 by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley. They demonstrated that any set of preference lists for the men and women admits at least one stable marriage and gave an algorithm for finding one. The stable marriage problem, and variations of it, have been the subject of over 100 academic papers and at least three books. These stable matching problems are important for studying auctions, polygamous versions are used to assign medical residents to hospitals and university students to projects proposed by lecturers, and there is an algorithm for finding a stable roommate assignment (which is similar to the marriage problem, but in this case a stable matching need not always exist). Mathematicians, computer scientists, economists, game theorists, and even physicists have studied these stable matching problems.The UK is already a world leader in research on stable matching algorithms. We wish to bring together experts here in the UK together with our expertise on MCMC methods. To date almost no research has been performed on the problem of sampling a random stable matching (for the marriage problem or its many variations) or in counting the number of matchings for a given pair of preference lists. Preliminary investigations have been performed by researchers in the US, but we wish to greatly expand this work and unite experts in the combinatorial structure of stable matchings (such as Dr. Rob Irving and Dr. David Manlove at the University of Glasgow) with our expertise on random sampling using MCMC methods. Establishing collaboration between these parties of experts is one of the significant aspects of the research proposed in this grant.Another problem we propose studying has links with statistical physics. Among other things, physicists study the structure of matter, and tilings are used to model crystals, quasicrystals, and other molecular structures. Research has been performed for domino tilings of regions of the square lattice and lozenge tilings of the hexagonal lattice. We propose examining the class of rhombic tilings of a regular polygon (with an even number of sides). These tilings have connections to other combinatorial structures, but outside of the case of a 6-sided figure, there have only been numerical results given. We wish to obtain rigorous theoretical bounds on the mixing time of Markov chains for sampling this types of tilings.We also propose finding bounds on the mixing time for Markov chains used to sample euler tours in eulerian graphs with bounded degree. A graph is eulerian if there is a closed circuit that traverses each edge exactly once. The only known published results on this problem contain an error, and, hence, the problem is completely open at this time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183312</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I don't know of any particular impact of this work beyond the academic world.</gtr:description><gtr:id>31907EE3-646A-4983-9E87-E46DA1FDBEDD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5464a88dce47b1.64366136</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main developments were to examine the computational limits of some mathematical problems, i.e. what can be efficiently computed. There are a large number of counting problems which are difficult to answer with exact solutions in an efficiently computable manner (even with substantial improvements in technology, they are inherently mathematically difficult tasks to perform). We examined some specialized versions of counting problems related to the so-called &amp;quot;stable matching&amp;quot; problem, showing even restricted versions of these problems are computationally equivalent to other problems (which are believed to be difficult to solve exactly).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main impact will be academic in nature, for other computer scientists and mathematicians to use.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>933B3E90-3521-474A-B622-0EAAD77A7410</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464a982cd8cb1.76183770</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66553E6B-2914-4161-B204-DC77E8111D4D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The complexity of approximately counting stable matchings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theoretical Computer Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/29c8c795b6275455f53cd23d381639b6"><gtr:id>29c8c795b6275455f53cd23d381639b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chebolu P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d00c00c9176625</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>118CE1EF-C7B6-4D5E-81E6-1FF5A96F2CA4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exact counting of Euler tours for generalized series-parallel graphs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Discrete Algorithms</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/29c8c795b6275455f53cd23d381639b6"><gtr:id>29c8c795b6275455f53cd23d381639b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chebolu P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cff9ff9874487e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>88CB8494-6F84-426C-80A9-CBFC5A350005</gtr:id><gtr:title>The complexity of approximately counting stable roommate assignments</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Computer and System Sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/29c8c795b6275455f53cd23d381639b6"><gtr:id>29c8c795b6275455f53cd23d381639b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chebolu P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f95b95be28643f</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F020651/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
