However, the success of interventions that provide information is often varied.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of this research is to improve understanding of the process by which information changes emotional responses. Three studies employ repeated sequences of learning, intervention, and test stages, to examine the influence of verbal information on an emotional response.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Study 1 will establish optimal parameters for the following two studies. Studies 2 and 3 will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine neural correlates in the brain between working memory, which maintains the information that is given as part of an intervention, and emotional response systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our objectives are to test three hypotheses&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>information can generate emotions, and emotions so generated will resemble ?natural? emotions that are acquired through experience &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>information can enhance and attenuate emotions&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>emotional responses result from predictions that the brain makes about the impact of an event on a person?s goals.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>An improved understanding of the processes involved in successful interventions and behaviour change will be critical to a number of social objectives, particularly those related to health and well being.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>265477</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Division of Infection, Immunity &amp; Respiratory Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Berzuini</gtr:description><gtr:id>280C5F4F-4D77-4000-BA3E-FE04C85FEC59</gtr:id><gtr:impact>submitted paper, 2 rejected grants (ARUK, MRC)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9403a8ee6a4.79588455-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Carlo modelled the data Hoskin and I have collected.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Began a collaboration with Prof. Carlo Berzuini.

We have overall carried out 14 different studies in the course of this award. 

Experiment 2

We have piloted tasks related to the objectives set out for experiment 2 in a series of 8 experiments. Data from the first 6 experiments was not usable for reasons to do with equipment (see below). Data from experiment 7 showed that the analysis plan was not appropriate because of problems with the software provided by our collaborator (see below). This suggested that the experimental design delineated in the proposal was not appropriate for either ERP studies or fMRI studies. Through collaborations we now located a neuroimaging technique that we CAN use to achieve the original objective, an EEG technique called 'steady state visual evoked potentials'. We are currently working on a version of this experiment using that technique. 

This work helped me reach a situation where I have a working laboratory using pain delivery apparatus, skin conductance response apparatus, and a data collection and analysis protocol for both of these. However, the challenges I faced meant that the grant work therefore focused on the objectives set out for Experiment 3. 

The learning and expertise developed in the course of this work meant that I was able to support a student who was interested in using psychophysiological measurements in research on climate change, a project which resulted in a research publication and impact (Maehr et al. 2015). Similarly, the expertise I built with using pain suggested that more work was needed in order to properly formalise the effect of expectations on pain perception. We found that there is a large individual difference in how sensitive people are to the effect of pain expectations. This work generated ideas for a new project, a PhD studentship and a grant application in collaboration with my ESRC grant mentor and others, on pain expectations. The grant was recently submitted to the MRC for funding and now written up for ARUK. 

Experiment 3

We have carried out 5 studies - 3 behavioural and 2 fMRI - to achieve the objective set out for Experiment 3 in the grant proposal. 

Prior to collecting any experimental data I engaged with a collaborator to develop a principled framework for modelling the interaction between negative and positive experiences. This draws on advanced models in economics and findings in decision neuroscience (Talmi and Pine, 2012). I wrote an ERC Starter grant on the basis of this review paper, which has been shortlisted by the ERC. I am now collaborating with a professor of Economics to obtain funding for this project. 

The 4 studies we carried out were designed to optimise the task prior to scanning with fMRI (as per Experiment 1 in the grant proposal). The results from the behavioural experiments show that reward does not attenuate the threat participants associate with stimuli that predict pain. They also show that reward reduces the dislike participants express for stimuli that predict pain, but the effect is additive - it does not attenuate the impact of pain on liking. Finally, they show that reward does not reduce the level of pain participants experience. 

In the behavioural studies we measured skin conductance responses to index physiological arousal. Our findings suggest that reward does not diminish skin conductance responses evoked in anticipation of punishment. 

The preliminary fMRI results from the first fMRI study are being written up now. We found that in the context of threat of pain reward responses no longer resemble those that are observed in experiments where participants are offered reward without pain. We found that the promise of reward does not diminish neural correlates of the fear response. Instead, a stimulus associated with both reward and pain triggers a robust and unique activation pattern. This finding is likely to contribute to our understanding of how reward can be used as an intervention to help people regulate fear responses and negative emotion in general.

The thinking that went into realising this work suggested that we need to know more about the neural signature of emotional valence. The conceptual framework in economics suggest that the two cancel each other out; this matches the thinking in decision neuroscience where neurobiological signals for reward are thought to have the opposite sign to those associated with punishment. I have taken up a subsidiary project in order to study this issue, using Event Related Potentials. We found that the Event-Related Potential (ERP) called the 'feedback related negativity' appears to respond similarly to positive and negative experiences, and therefore may signal salience rather than emotional valence. Specifically, signal is more positive to delivered reward AND for delivered punishment, instead of reward and punishment cancelling each other out (Talmi, Atkinson and El-Deredy, 2013). This challenges the dominant theory in the field and helps shed light on our unexpected fMRI results. We have now replicated these results using reward and punishment stimuli that are better matched to each other, a paper currently written for publication (Hird et al., in preparation). 

Additional experiments
The work we've done on the grant suggested that we need a better handle of self report of pain. The trouble we've been having in confirming our hypotheses suggested that multiple factors are at play which the experiment design is not accounting for. We have therefore embarked on work to describe the factors that underline pain reports, with a focus on situations where people are given some information about upcoming pain (as in our experiments) and need to report how much pain they felt. This project has developed substantially into a statistical Bayesian model of self report. The model allows us to classify individuals to those more and less sensitive to aspects of their own pain expectations. we believe this work can have clinical relevance, and have been pursuing additional funding (2 rejected grants, currently have one grant under review, an internal MRC confidence in concept grant).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Currently the impact is mainly on academic audience. 

Decision neuroscientists could benefit from the proposed computational approach to cost-benefit analysis (Talmi &amp;amp; Pine 2012). This is work I am pursuing in a current grant application. Similarly, EEG researchers working on EEG signals of emotional valence have already benefitted from our findings, which challenge the dominant theory in the field. I have convened a symposium to discuss this. Our work motivated a key figure in the field to begin an experiment that has now been submitted for publication; a number of other papers are now citing our work as inspirational. The paper already has 49 citations. 

Policy makers and planners involved with decision on onshore windfarm location may benefit from the findings described in Maehr et al. (2015) where we suggested novel ways to assess the reaction of the public to the visual impact of turbines. 

My main objective was to shed light on the neural mechanism underlying emotion regulation. Our current findings are preliminary, but striking - reward appear to do nothing to mitigate fear responses. The impact of this work will only be realised later once the findings are published, but the aim is to assess their influence in educational settings where people face challenges in order to gain long-term reward.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6036CC42-9856-4280-A7F0-5C45ABB92E71</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5465de9b580777.91166394</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EC9EF17F-7F53-44EA-9246-BECDC614A969</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sensitivity to Pain Expectations: A Bayesian Model of Individual Differences</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/79962d0979ddc2fc697e6b144d48d77a"><gtr:id>79962d0979ddc2fc697e6b144d48d77a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hoskin R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58c93eef3419b9.45215701</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BE530C52-F78C-4371-921E-76F7BB30B858</gtr:id><gtr:title>The feedback-related negativity signals salience prediction errors, not reward prediction errors.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b4abb9549b44eb00e449820b05c28372"><gtr:id>b4abb9549b44eb00e449820b05c28372</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Talmi D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0270-6474</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5465dfd59f3735.59149018</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7980FBE9-CB7B-4F9D-A651-DF6570597C74</gtr:id><gtr:title>How costs influence decision values for mixed outcomes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b4abb9549b44eb00e449820b05c28372"><gtr:id>b4abb9549b44eb00e449820b05c28372</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Talmi D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1662-453X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5465dfb5e2cbc7.92864843</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7ED3CB1E-506B-4F12-9BEF-0F2DD1B2F97D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Emotional response to images of wind turbines: A psychophysiological study of their visual impact on the landscape.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Landscape and urban planning</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/73c7ff1ff6a321a4cfbfadab85c7ce6f"><gtr:id>73c7ff1ff6a321a4cfbfadab85c7ce6f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Maehr AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56406f9788a5c2.44376481</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I010424/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-061-25-0512</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
