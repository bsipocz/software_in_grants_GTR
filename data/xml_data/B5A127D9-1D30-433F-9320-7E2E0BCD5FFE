There are different ways of formulating the issue. The most traditional one asks how our belief that anyone who does something on a particular occasion could usually have done something else instead (that they 'could have done otherwise') is to be rendered consistent with the idea that everything that happens in the universe is necessitated by a set of antecedent circumstances, necessitated in their turn by a further set ... and so on, back until the dawn of time (determinism). My answer is that these things cannot be rendered consistent, and so, in the terminology of the literature, I am an incompatibllist with respect to the traditional question. But there are two reasons why the traditional question does not really get to the heart of the matter. The first is that hardly anybody believes any longer that the universe is deterministic, which robs the traditional question of much of its interest. But the second, and much more important reason, is that it has long been recognised that indeterminism seems to present problems for freedom that are arguably just as great, or perhaps even greater, than those posed by determinism. For if a given event is not necessitated by antecedent circumstances, must it not just be a matter of chance whether or not it occurs? And how, it is asked, can the injection of merely chance happenings into the causal order help us to see how WA can have true control over the course of events? The work I am proposing to do addresses this question. I accept that the injection of merely
random happenings into a physical reality conceived of as merely a huge network of events cannot help us see how agency is possible. The challenge is then to see whether a variety of indeterminism can be developed which does not merely consist in the injection of random happenings into the causal order; and which is also non-obfuscatory and mysterious, not reliant on peculiar or supernatural conceptions of persons.

My aim in this research is to make progress with the development of this conception of indeterminism. I believe that the provision of a satisfactory answer to questions in this area of philosophy requires a new (or perhaps rather a return to old, Aristotelian) ways of thinking about the world around us 
one which replaces the image of the unified homogeneous universe with which the 17th century scientific revolution has left us, with a more knobbly, heterogeneous one which properly respects the causal autonomy of complex entities- and in particular, of animals.

The research will, I hope, make an important and distinctive contribution to the free will literature. With one or two important exceptions, most recent literature on the free will issue has adopted a compatibilist line. The attractions of compatibilist are, I think, bolstered by the conviction on the part of many of its adherents that since it is just as hard (or harder) to see how indeterminism can be rendered compatible with freedom; we may as well persevere with compatibilist strategies. I hope to strike a significant blow for the other side and to show that there are indeed ways in which one can prevent the denial of determinism turning into merely the embrace of randomness.

It is never easy to explicate the applications and benefits of philosophical work which are by their nature rather intangible. But I would say that the successful development of the conception of causal reality which I wish to try to defend would be a very significant contribution to the solution of one of the most intriguing and important philosophical questions there is.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21151</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D501628/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D3297D2-A1F7-4EE8-A676-CD04BB9D7689</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metaphysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>143EF6F8-CF59-4D04-9EA7-40D70FC41177</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Mind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
