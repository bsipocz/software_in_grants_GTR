The aim was to provide outcomes which concentrated upon the issue of public benefit. For example, collections will normally be transferred to other museums in order to protect them for the benefit of future generations and to increase accessibility and engagement amongst current members of the public. A further aim was to investigate the circumstances when a sale would be appropriate, and to detail the steps which should be taken to ensure that a sale was carried out with proper care and in a professional manner.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research relied partly upon an examination of legislation, reported cases and articles. It also involved knowledge exchange, whereby the researcher advised staff working in&amp;nbsp; the Museums Association of the application of legal principles and these staff discussed how ethical principles would apply to sales. The research therefore involved creating an understanding of the interaction of law and museum practice.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The outcomes have included a book chapter and an article together with a draft set of ?Due Diligence Guidelines? for the museum sector relating to sales of items. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research project is concerned with changing attitudes to deaccessioning of objects from public collections, which has been reflected in changes to the Museum Association's Code of Ethics for Museums in 2007. It will deal with issues of resilience and sustainability in response to a changing economic and social environment. 

The issue of how best to protect cultural objects for the benefit of future generations is contentious. It needs to be addressed with an awareness of domestic law and also the UK's international obligations including those imposed by the United Nations Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property 1970. The objective is to support museums by providing guidance in relation to the management of assets, with particular reference to sales and conditional sales. 

The research needs to be carried out with confidential stakeholder consultation and participation. Direct beneficiaries of outcomes, such as policy statements, will include museums such as the Manchester Museum, the National Gallery, the Fitzwilliam Museum, the Royal Cornwall Museum and the Imperial War Museum, together with other relevant public bodies such as the Art Fund and the Collections Trust. However, there will be other bodies, such as the Charities Commission, which may also benefit. Museums and public bodies in other countries, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the International Council of Museums, would also appreciate and benefit from the guidance produced, which could be made publicly available on the Museum Association's web-site. 

The beneficiaries also include the commercial sector. The share of the global market which a particular country enjoys will vary according to a large number of factors, including its system of regulation and taxation and the state of its economy. If there are clear and considered policies in place relating to deaccessioning and disposal, this will support a thriving art market. Auction houses in particular will indirectly benefit because there will be increased confidence in dealing with and purchasing objects from museums. 

Experienced lawyers involved in this sector, such as Farrer &amp;amp; Co, will derive indirect benefit from a fresh initiative. The guidance provided will also be useful for probate solicitors, advising clients in relation to gifts to museums in their wills. In a climate of uncertainty, people may become reluctant to donate to museums. If a scheme is in place which provides a rational structure and establishes best practice in terms of consistency, transparency and new understandings of relations between ethics and law relation to deaccessioning and disposal, this should provide the right environment for gift giving. 

By publishing articles and providing conference presentations during the year and afterwards, this research should be beneficial to the scholarly community both now and in the future.
 
The research is intended to encourage careful decision making. The current financial climate is a difficult and challenging one and the need for responsible management has never been stronger. By disseminating the outcomes of this research in a variety of forms, including articles, conferences, and by publication on the Museums Association's web-site, it is hoped that this research will foster responsible management of our cultural heritage in this country and abroad for the benefit of future generations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51067</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arts Council England</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sales and Curatorially motivated disposals: Arts Council England</gtr:description><gtr:id>AB75061F-1B28-40B8-8A80-4F7FC785A3C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have produced a 57 page pdf guidance booklet on the legal and ethical aspects of curatorially motivated disposals.

It is freely available to download from the Museums Association's website.

I produced a book chapter (The Sale of Items in Museum Collections' chapter 11 in N. Hopkins (ed), Modern Studies in Property Law, Volume 7 (2013, Oxford: Hart Publishing), 217-241) and an article (&amp;quot;Dealing with UK Museum Collections: Law, Ethics and the Public/Private Divide&amp;quot; International Journal of Cultural Property Issue 2-3 / August 2015, pp 177-204) which include discussion of local authority collections. I recommended that local authority collections should have charitable status. This issue was discussed by the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cultural Heritage on 8 February 2017 and it was agreed to discuss it further later this year.

I provided Scott Furlong and Isabel Wilson of ACE with a draft of . &amp;quot;The Museums Association's Code of Ethics 2015&amp;quot; which was published in (2016) XXI (2) Art Antiquity and Law 143 - 156. Isabel made some comments (in relation to accreditation) and I adjusted my article accordingly. 

Scott and Isabel were also supplied with my article on &amp;quot;Frozen in Time: Orphans and Uncollected Objects in Museum Collections&amp;quot; International Journal of Cultural Property (2017) 24, 1-28 and it has formed the basis for discussion of law reform relating to acquisition of title.

I have had several lengthy meetings at the London offices of Arts Council England with Scott Furlong, Director of Collections and Cultural Property, early on in my AHRC Leadership Fellowship, to discuss what needed to be included in the pdf guidance for the museum sector. We have kept in touch since then by e-mail, telephone and by conversations at conferences. 
I have supplied Scott Furlong and Isabel Wilson with a number of articles which I have written and which we have discussed. On the basis of these publications, we have discussed legislation in two areas in particular:
(1) altering the status of local authority museum collections so that their status is charitable to ensure that any sales are well considered and acceptable to the sector. This recommendation is linked to my ESRC 50% Placement Fellowship (Ethical and Legal Aspects of Sales from Museum Collections)
(2) enabling accredited museums to acquire legal title to objects in their collections where there is uncertainty over ownership (orphan collections, deposited objects, and uncollected loans). This recommendation is linked to my AHRC Award (the Status of Museum Collections).
I am currently discussing both law proposals with the DCMS and the English and Scottish Law Commissions

Isabel Wilson from ACE and I are part of a team engaged in drafting ethical and legal guidance which will be published in May 2017 which will assist the governing bodies of museums facing closure. This further project is based upon research carried out as part of my AHRC Award (the Status of Museum Collections).

If the disposal of an object is by way of a transfer to another museum, there is usually no difficulty. However, if there is a proposal by a museum to sell an object it may become highly controversial, taking up the time of various public bodies (such as the Arts Council England and the Art and Antiques Unit of the Metropolitan Police).

The role of the Museums Association was to give me a grounding in museum professional ethics and practice. I worked at their offices as much as I could (I could only take up the Fellowship at 50%). The Association hosted meetings of the Ethics Committee at its offices which I attended. The Association hosted meetings with Arts Council England at which we discussed the drafting of the guidelines on financially motivated sales. These meetings with the Arts Council were important because a museum risks losing its accreditation from the Arts Council if it carries out a financially motivated sale in a reckless and irresponsible fashion. 
The Museums Association runs a website with a discussion page and they gave me the opportunity to discuss my first draft guidelines with museum professionals online. I then revised the guidelines in the light of the comments received.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Placement Fellowship involved Knowledge Exchange. I knew relatively little about museum professional ethics and practice. However, the people working at the Museums Association knew little about the law, whereas my knowledge is extensive. I explained the law to them when it was relevant to do so (such as where a museum had contacted the Association and wanted to obtain an outline of the law). I gave presentations and engaged with museum professionals at various conferences and workshops organised by the Museums Association and other public bodies. I also used the Museums Association's discussion page on its website. I gathered as much information as I could about attitudes to financially motivated disposals to help me prepare guidance to help the museum sector.

I have recently put forward a proposal for law reform, which would state that local authority collections should enjoy charitable status. If this proposal became law, local authorities would need to seek the permission of the Charity Commission if they wished to sell a cultural object from their collections. This restriction would help to prevent reckless sales.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Charity Commission for England and Wales</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Curatorially motivated disposals: Charity Commission</gtr:description><gtr:id>CC9689DB-622C-4076-BB9D-74EF67E3AA70</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Charity Commission has made it clear that they appreciated having someone to represent the museum sector when they were revising their guidance on trusteeship.

I had a particularly interesting discussion after the presentation of the paper regarding university collections. One member of the audience was a trustee and was taken aback to find that guidelines would be published in relation to any proposed sales. My impression from this conversation was that a trustee of a university collection will be primarily concerned with the university's aims and objectives and its internal regulations rather than first looking to professional guidance within the museum sector.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544eb66ccf5091.86363554</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation: Art Crime: Sketching Boundaries and Mapping Prevalence.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7CF3B2EA-CCAC-4B8D-A420-A76094A4FDE5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented a paper on &amp;quot;Analysing Art Crime&amp;quot; at a conference/workshop on Art Crime: Sketching Boundaries and Mapping Prevalence.

It is a worldwide problem and everyone is concerned to prevent ill-considered sales which deprive future generations of the opportunity to engage with culturally important works of art and antiquities.

The discussion reinforced my thinking that the right approach would be to build a series of stages in to my guidance, so that governing bodies of museums were pressed to reflect upon their plans.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544e66c1bab4c6.68676059</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/pdf/Disposal_Toolkit_Appendix_4.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Member of an expert panel discussing. &quot;Museum Closure&quot; at the Museums Association's annual conference in Glasgow.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E4A1B181-A535-4BB3-B90E-F070D11D6422</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was one of three members of an expert panel discussing. &amp;quot;Museum Closure&amp;quot; at the Museums Association's annual conference.

The focus of this session was on curatorially motivated disposal where there is little or no information about an object's provenance.

This was a particularly valuable session because of the discussion which followed. Up until this point, it had not occurred to me that museums would expect guidance on situations where an object had been deposited on loan and had not been collected at the end of the loan.

In the discussion itself, there was one museum worker who seemed quite oblivious to any risks associated with disposing of objects which might have been smuggled into the country in the past. I made a note that I must make sure that this was highlighted in the checklist in my guidance. At lunch, I was interested to talk to someone at lunch from a local authority who told me that her boss was nervous of disposing of anything. This is important information because one could easily assume from media coverage that museums were too keen to dispose.

It is vital that the guidance which I was acceptable to the museum sector, which is made up of a very diverse group of people. This sort of activity is essential for learning about what people do not know and do not understand and what issues concern them.

The participants discussed ways in which local authorities could be prevented from acting in a reckless way to strip museum collections of their most valuable objects (both culturally and financially). As the sale of the Sekhemka statue demonstrated, an object could be taken from a collection and sold to a private buyer; it could be exported overseas so that it was lost to the British viewing public forever. 
Although various ideas were discussed, the group agreed with my suggestion that local authority collections should be given charitable status. This would mean that, before an object was sold, the local authority would need to obtain permission from the Charity Commission.
The organiser of the workshop, Dr. Alice Stevenson, then raised my proposal with the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cultural Heritage in the autumn of 2016. The Group agreed to discuss it at the next meeting on 8 February 2017 but we ran out of time.

The workshop was organised by UCL in response to demands from members of two &amp;quot;action groups&amp;quot; who had worked to challenge local authority decisions to sell objects from their museums' collections. The action groups consisted of ordinary members of the public, who were concerned to challenge Northampton Borough Council's sale of the Sekhemka statue and Croydon Council's sale of ceramics. These action groups were keen to have an interdisciplinary workshop where the law and ethics and other matters could be discussed because they had felt that public bodies, such as the Arts Council, should have done more to prevent these sales. A representative from the Arts Council was present to provide that organisation's view and I was involved to help these people understand the law. 
During 2014 and 2015, I had helped the Sekhemka action group by explaining legal terms to them so that they could understand the process. Even so, I was careful to remain impartial in the same way as the Arts Council and the Museums Association. It was important to remain neutral in a complex situation where local residents were in conflict with their local authority. In the end, Northampton Borough Council's museums were stripped of their accreditation by the Arts Council due to the sale of the Sekhemka statue: the sale was declared unethical and in breach of the Museums Association's Code of Ethics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9e40807f0a9.12319943</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;The Legal and Ethical Status of Museum Collections.&quot; Museum of London workshop.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C69C19E4-DFA9-4CBF-A9CB-D87DD45CCA8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;The Legal and Ethical Status of Museum Collections.&amp;quot; Museum of London Development Skills plus training. 11 November 2015.

The Scottish Law Commission found my book chapter on 'The Sale of Items from Museum Collections' very useful in preparing their Report on Prescription and Title to Moveable Property (Scot Law Com No 228, 2012) 
I discussed the guidelines with Scott Furlong of Arts Council England on 6 August 2014 because he was preparing a presentation on this subject for an international audience to be held in Canada. It is pleasing to think that the UK can offer leadership in this field and to help other countries which may also need guidance on this issue. 
If a museum engages in a reckless disposal in breach of the Museum Association's Code of Ethics, the Arts Council England can withdraw accreditation from the museum, which means that it is no longer eligible to apply for grants for a period of time (usually five years). There was a danger, before I produced these guidelines, that the loss of accreditation could be challenged by way of judicial review on the basis that there was insufficient guidance in the Code of Ethics. Now that the guidance has been published, I would anticipate that this is no longer possible. Removing this risk is significant: a local authority run museum lost its accreditation recently but the local authority could not challenge this decision because it was clearly in breach of the ethical principles. 

My findings have been used as a basis for discussion between the Arts Council, the Museums Association and myself regarding whether local authorities should be restricted by law in relation to their freedom to sell objects from museum collections. These public bodies are now discussing law reform with the DCMS; I have discussed it with the DCMS and Law Commission.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B8302F5C-79D4-4110-AF4C-B554BB26276D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544fbf879a3c11.20793042</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My guidelines on financially motivated disposals (normally meaning sales by auction of objects in museum collections) have been a great achievement. They are to be found in Appendix 4 to the Disposal Toolkit and can be downloaded from the Museums Association's website. 
In drawing up these guidelines, I scrutinised museum ethics and then weave thosed principles, along with legal principles, into a step by step procedure for museums professionals and their governing bodies. 
At each stage, the guidelines direct the reader to consider certain specified legal and ethical issues and to take certain steps, such as consulting other professionals in the sector. Readers are also instructed regarding when they should consult professional bodies (the Museums Association and Arts Council England) and what information would need to be supplied. 
Museums are diverse (national, local government, charitable, private and independent, etc.). A great deal of research was required in relation to the law. However, the guidelines eventually produced help every museum: they provide a clear structure and are comprehensive.
The guidance clarified some principles of law. Until I was awarded the Placement Fellowship, museum professionals always assumed that they would need to obtain the best price if they decided to sell an object. However, as a commercial lawyer, I knew that this legal principle had evolved in a commercial context involving businesses. I thought that there was a strong argument to be made that it did not apply where a public body such as a museum sold to another museum in order to keep a cultural object in the public domain and to maximise the benefit to the public: when I liaised with the Charity Commission, it was accepted that this was the case for charitable museums. I was therefore able to incorporate this point into the guidelines.

I did produce two other publications and one of these, a book chapter entitled 'The Sale of Items from Museum Collections' could also be considered as an excellent achievement, as it was cited in a Report by the Scottish Law Commission.
The Placement Fellowship was part-time and the guidelines were the main objective; the objective was therefore satisfied.
However, I achieved more than the objective set because I managed to find far more information than expected and I acted as a catalyst in helping the Museums Association work with the Arts Council. As mentioned, I also produced other publications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I have become far more conscious of how private law may need to be modified to accommodate the notion of 'public benefit.' It means that I have insights which, apart from assisting museums, may be used in different contexts. For example, my views were cited frequently by the Law Commission in its analysis of Responses to 'Social Investment by Charities' in 2014:
http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/docs/cp216_charities_social_investment_recommendations_responses.pdf
The Placement Fellowship encouraged me to reach out to public bodies which may have had no links with each other. Once bridges are built, it is then easier for one public body (such as the Museums Association) to contact another (such as the Charity Commission). 

The controversy generated by the sale of the Sekhemka statue by Northampton BC has led to calls for reform of the law. I have suggested new legislation which would provide that local authorities should hold museum collections on charitable trusts
This proposal was discussed at a meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cultural Heritage at Westminster on 8 February 2017. There will be further discussion at a meeting later this year. In the meantime, the Law Commission is waiting to see if the DCMS wishes to instruct it to carry out more wide-ranging research on local government legislation and how it applies to cultural property.. I am helping the Law Commission by supplying my publications and providing feedback from conference presentations on proposed changes to the law.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1C338857-32FD-45C7-A1FC-9408D4BBC98E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544fc47d9a7388.76504358</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/pdf/Disposal_Toolkit_Appendix_4.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in discussions of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cultural Heritage at the Palace of Westminster</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5862AD8-85B5-4128-9B38-BF160A3C5A81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have been attending the meetings of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cultural Heritage since 2016.

This new legislation would be based upon my research (AHRC Fellowship relating to the Status of Museum Collections) plus research carried out by the Scottish Law Commission. A representative from the DCMS was present and we discussed the proposal further at the end of the meeting.
We also briefly discussed another proposal relating to the ethical and legal aspects of sales from museum collections (which was the subject of my ESRC/AHRC Placement Fellowship). I have proposed that local authority collections should be held on charitable trusts. It was agreed that this topic should be discussed in more detail later this year.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c66abbdc0fa5.20981841</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation by the Scottish Law Commission in its Report on Prescription and Title to Moveable Property (Scot Law Com No 228, 2012) in its Report on Prescription and Title to Moveable Property (Scot Law Com No 228, 2012) at [1.10], [3.4], [4.09].</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E88E193-EBD2-49B5-8ECD-35C7ADD947D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Scottish Law Commission put forward proposals to alter the law so that stale claims by an original owner could be ignored after a stipulated period of time had elapsed. The original owner would be deprived of his/her property as a consequence.
My draft chapter proved particularly useful in helping the Commission understand how their proposed changes might significantly assist the museum sector in Scotland (see para. 4.09 in particular on this point). 
The Commission's legislative proposals were discussed in the Scottish Parliament but were not taken forward. I assume that this was because they were too wide-ranging. In other words, if the proposals had been confined to museum collections, there should have been no difficulty. But their Report covered every type of moveable property and consequently any proposed legislation might have caused deep controversy. The Report remains valuable (including my assistance) in case a more limited reform is proposed in the future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544f8269308e83.65227550</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/law-reform-projects/completed-projects/prescription-and-title-to-moveable-property/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08BF91B9-2C9C-45E2-8B2D-45A43EE6345B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Appendix 4 of the Disposal Toolkit</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/89aa87f33835706a84240a72fd643f11"><gtr:id>89aa87f33835706a84240a72fd643f11</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ulph, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5448d4d23d1001.28801072</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9124A477-4AE3-420E-BF89-3A23B798EE55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Should We Put a Monetary Value on Collections?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Museums Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/89aa87f33835706a84240a72fd643f11"><gtr:id>89aa87f33835706a84240a72fd643f11</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ulph, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5448d6437c4043.43564854</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>74EF7DEF-077D-4E84-BDA0-5638BF8EB64F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Book review: &amp;quot;Museum Law&amp;quot;</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Museum &amp; Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/89aa87f33835706a84240a72fd643f11"><gtr:id>89aa87f33835706a84240a72fd643f11</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ulph, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e05d9c187218.14048322</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DB86480E-C5F0-48B3-A6CB-FB59186432A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>THE LEGAL AND ETHICAL STATUS OF MUSEUM COLLECTIONS - Curatorially Motivated Disposals</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/89aa87f33835706a84240a72fd643f11"><gtr:id>89aa87f33835706a84240a72fd643f11</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ulph, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d9d083d4c788.05508155</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J011371/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6F2E89E-46FA-4084-B88C-26D28FC989C6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Common Law inc.
