In plants this variation in form is obvious in the many different leaf shapes we see when eating a salad or walking in a park. For example, spinach has simple leaves whereas parsley has complex, subdivided leaves. Leaves are also interesting to study because they play a key role in the food chain being the main photosynthetic organs of land plants and thus responsible for CO2 fixation in terrestrial ecosystems. For these reasons, understanding how diversity in leaf form is generated is of considerable interest to scientists. To study this problem we work with the hairy bittercress (Cardamine hirsuta), which is a plant that has complex leaves subdivided into leaflets. The presence of leaflets makes this plant very different to its close relative the thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), which has simple, undivided leaves. We already know a lot about how a simple leaf shape is produced in thale cress because it is easy to do experiments with. Hairy bittercress is also very easy to work with in the lab, so we use it to understand how leaflets are produced and ultimately why this plant makes leaflets whereas its relative the thale cress does not. One important problem with such comparisons is that while we can identify individual proteins that might be responsible for generating the different leaf shapes of these two plants it is very difficult to understand by what 'rules' the 'sum' of all the possible processes that regulate shape is 'created' in plants and how this 'sum' influences the timing, position and direction of cellular growth to direct formation of different leaf shapes. To resolve this problem we will collaborate with computer scientists who by considering when and where particular proteins that influence bitter cress development are expressed, produce models that can help clarify what might be these fundamental 'rules' that govern leaflet formation and determine final shape. Additionally, we will improve our knowledge of how exactly hairy bittercress leaflets grow and this will involve two methods. Firstly, we will use a laser based visualization methodology that will allow us to capture images of leaves while they are growing without destroying them, and produce time lapse movies of their growth, not unlike those seen in David Attenborough movies except the structures we will be observing will be tiny. Secondly to directly observe the hairy bitter cress cells that divide to produce leaflets we will use a method that renders the tissue 'see-through' and will hence allow us to obtain three-dimensional images of the developing leaflets when they are still very small and inaccessible to dissection. This method, which is similar in its logic to medical tomography will allow us to directly visualize dividing cells and hopefully pinpoint the locations of cell division at successive stages of development. Information obtained from these two methods will be used to producer more accurate models of how leaves of different species end up having different shapes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We aim to understand how species-specific differences in action of key developmental genes are translated into natural variation in leaf form. To this end we developed C.hirsuta, a dissected-leafed plant related to the simple-leafed model organism A.thaliana into a powerful genetic system, and we wish to understand why C.hirsuta unlike A.thaliana produces leaflets. Understanding how development of these two closely related species differs is challenging because initiating leaf primordia appear identical, but the two species attain very different final leaf shapes due to poorly understood differences in the location, timing and direction of cellular growth after leaf initiation. To address this problem we will develop an interdisciplinary research direction where computational modelling and leading-edge imaging technologies will be deployed in C.hirsuta to enrich developmental genetics approaches, thus allowing us to define the mechanisms underlying leaflet formation and hence species-specific elaboration of leaf geometry. Our recent data suggest firstly that only marginal cellular lineages contribute to leaflet formation and secondly that the small indolic hormone auxin and KNOTTED1 homedomain transcription factors promote leaflet formation by acting in a negative feedback loop. Together with P. Prusinkiewicz we propose to examine whether formalized computational models based on these data can produce leaflet patterns such as those observed in C.hirsuta. We also propose to exploit Optical Projection Tomography and live Confocal Microscopy methodologies to directly study leaf growth pattern and gene expression dynamics and thus further enrich models that conceptualize the fundamental principles that distinguish leaf growth of the two species.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>291864</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>300000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>An Interdisciplinary approach to study development and diversity of leaves</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>4C7DD382-4C18-48E3-946C-FCF67D8D2118</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-353064313.8597387068819d6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>HFSP highlighted our Bilsborough et al paper on their website as outreach</gtr:description><gtr:id>1822A488-62EC-4876-BFD2-EEB0C4722CF2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddca942ddff0.94823685</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main aim of this fellowship was to develop a research direction in computational modelling of development in collaboration with the Prusinkiewicz group in Calgary. Aided by several research visits and Skype sessions we undertook joint work that produced models of leaf development based on either boundary propagation or abstraction of the leaf in two dimensions. These models were based on consideration of activities of the following biological components as suggested by visualization of gene expression and genetic interactions: the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) transcription factor which is expressed at the leaf margin, the small indolic hormone auxin, the auxin efflux transporter PINFORMED1 (PIN1) and homedomain transcription factors of the KNOTTED1 class. An important advance in modelling was development of the aforementioned boundary propagation methodology that simplifies the leaf to its growing edge. Biological justification for this methodology was provided by tissue specific complementation experiments showing that a PIN1 fusion protein expressed from the epidermal ATML1 promoter was sufficient to suppress leaf margin defects of pin1 mutants in both C. hirsuta and and A. thaliana. This work emphasizes the key role of patterning occurring at the epidermal margin for leaf morphogenesis and led to a publication in PNAS (1). 



In parallel with this leaf modelling work we developed methodologies for time lapse of C. hirsuta leaf development. Finally the know-how we developed in modelling allowed us to explore organization of the genetic regulatory network influencing differentiation in the A. thaliana root and this was an additional and unexpected benefit of the fellowship.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The publications produced with funding from the fellowship provide fundamental insight on how leaves and roots grow and thus are of considerable benefit to the field. Examples of their impact are the following 

i. Both the Dello Ioio et al and Bilsborough et al publications received Faculty 1000 listings. ii. Dello Ioio et al was highlighted with a &amp;quot;Dispatch&amp;quot; commentary piece when published (Bishopp, A., Ursache, R., Helariutta, Y. Plant development: How long is a root? (2012) Current Biology, 22 (21), pp. R919-R921). iii Bilsborough et al has been cited 28 times since publication and was highlighted in a broad interest write up on morphogenesis in the &amp;quot;New Scientist&amp;quot; (Kwok R., New Scientist Vol. 215, 38-41). It is not unlikely that the work we have done will have bearing on how biomass of these tissues is regulated and can be modified. We are currently investigating these possibilities and are designing projects to test implications of our work for crop growth. Thus our work provides a good example of how fundamental research can lead to important advances in the field but also open up possibilities for more translational work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>146F28A4-8F89-43CE-9D49-DF59110D7477</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-775554776.9140031774a1a48</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F0B043F-54D9-4221-8CF0-6D038DED138C</gtr:id><gtr:title>A common developmental program can produce diverse leaf shapes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The New phytologist</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/01fbf780bf73371e03c4aadaeaf03815"><gtr:id>01fbf780bf73371e03c4aadaeaf03815</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Runions A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-646X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcefb6841a9.49933556</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A4C0440-7ADB-444C-860F-05B572E1B17C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cardamine hirsuta: a versatile genetic system for comparative studies.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4d30c78a1b2fc5692f8636686fd3a889"><gtr:id>4d30c78a1b2fc5692f8636686fd3a889</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hay AS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0960-7412</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>542834727cbdb1.23315611</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>48CB2924-5F31-4C29-8C8E-0B152FF7A7A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>A PHABULOSA/cytokinin feedback loop controls root growth in Arabidopsis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current biology : CB</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6b0fb8429cb58776387453bd36298789"><gtr:id>6b0fb8429cb58776387453bd36298789</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dello Ioio R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0960-9822</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675d7739e58c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G023905/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
