Once associated with civic activism and political mobilisation, theatre is now allied to public engagement and to the leisure and creative industries. Theatre for children is thriving, recognising that children are profitable cultural consumers. Government policies that promote creative learning aim to produce a flexible workforce in a post-industrial economy, and the creative industries have become instrumental to urban regeneration. Disused factories have been turned into arts centres, galleries, museums and theatres, promoted as cultural assets in the expectation of attracting entrepreneurial investment. Furthermore, in areas of economic deprivation, participating in the arts is seen as a powerful way to heal social division. As funding has increased for education and public engagement programmes, theatre-makers have responded to this economic and social climate by developing new ways to contribute to formal education and community learning. \n\nThis study is the first to investigate the effects of a newly globalised economy and re-branded creative industries on twenty-first century theatre education. Theatre education has always been often complexly poised between different agendas, negotiating the policies of the government of the day and the social, educational and artistic aspirations of theatre-makers and educators. This remains the case in the twenty-first century, where the rapid pace of technological and social change is impacting on both education and cultural policies. Within this climate, however, significant new sources of funding for creative learning have enabled theatre practitioners to work in ways that are not only artistically innovative, but also encourage new forms of social imagining. \n\nThis is the first study to bring together educational theatre, theatre for children and the performative pedagogies associated with social regeneration. Case-studies from different parts of the world will provide examples of education and public engagement programmes that take place in theatres, in the education and cultural sectors, in the leisure, tourist and creative industries. The research will, therefore, investigate the boundaries between leisure and learning, entertainment and education. The study unites these different practices around three conceptual themes, drawn from cultural geography, of place, space and mobilities. These act as central political metaphors for our time, asking fundamental questions about the role of theatre as a creative space, as a place of learning and as theatre-making as a transgressive act of displacement. The research, which brings together the voices of participants and theatre-makers with new ways of thinking about the arts, will impact on practitioners, policy-makers and educationalists as well as theatre academics. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-05-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36451</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Geographies of Amateur Creativity</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A624B41-54EE-417F-8633-5F0B63BC6CF5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an well-attended panel and the Royal Geographical Society Conference curated by doctoral student Cara Gray (with supervisor Helen Nicholson). Debates about the ways in which amateur creativity is place-based, and related to enthusiasm and life-long commitment generated new ways of thinking about amateur creativity as a geographical practice. There have been new meetings between researchers in geography as a result.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c90fe81f0ea1.02988511</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/6EF825AC-0B48-472F-B0DA-A491481DB116/0/AC2015ProgrammeBooklowerres.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings for this research have been used by theatre educationalists in Eastern Europe (parts of the book have been translated into Hungarian), Italy, USA, New Zealand and Singapore. The critique on the relationship between the creative economy and creative learning prompted revision of policies in theatres in globalised economies. This has now been extended to policy work at Tate, particularly focussing on Tate Exchange where I am a member of the steering committee. The book has informed the ways in which Tate has developed their creative learning programmes. The research has also been instrumental in informing my contribution to Paul Hamlyn's ArtWorks programme on training artists in participatory settings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C123AC7D-3B71-437B-9F2D-E7474EE36610</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>541d3d56b77248.64871256</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There were three main findings:
