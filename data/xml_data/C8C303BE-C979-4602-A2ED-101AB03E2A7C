It relates the science of photography to its construction as art and explores the ways in which optical and photographic technologies reconfigure our sense of the world.

My previous research has explored the physical surface of the photographic artwork, combining elements of Painting, Photography, Sculpture and Electronic Imaging. Early work used the saturated colour and high gloss surface of photographic print media to present a reflected world, both familiar and bizarre, real and imagined, random, yet highly ordered. Much of this work has been concerned with the very process of looking, perceiving and interpreting. Later, with the advent of digital printing, I experimented with presenting photographic images as paintings. I printed images on canvas and art paper as if paintings and drawings. The challenge to the viewer was to
decode this surface, questioning their notions of what is photography, what is painting. What relationship do these media have to notions of 'truth'? This research project takes this methodology in a new direction, re-investigating the three dimensional element of my work. I intend to take this challenge beyond the exploration of surface, directly to the visual cortex by creating a range of contemporary versions of Charles Wheatstone's' Mirror Stereoscope (1838). I will make the stereoscopes in such a manner as to be both scientific instrument and aesthetic object. Using these as a visual conduit, I will produce a complex series of narrative images. These images will investigate particular forms of visual phenomena and perceptual problems whilst referring throughout in various ways to the ephemeral nature of their own existence.

The project will investigate themes around areas as diverse as history, portraiture, identity, belief as well as photography and visual psychology. It will also explore an analogy between the invention of the stereoscopic viewer in 1838, and the development of the digital camera, and the digital image, in the contemporary period. Both of these technologies have presented difficulties in terms of the way the image is configured. The stereoscope presented an image 'without a surface' in the late 1830s, and the digital image offered a 'virtual' world in the late twentieth century. This project will explore the problematic use of technological innovation that profoundly disrupts our sense of the concrete image through a creative exploration of these parallel, if historically distanced, developments.

The project is experimental and interdisciplinary; it involves creative challenges and links into scientific endeavours as well as psychological theory. In this event it will include studio based visual research, broader discussions with interested parties (art historians, historians of science, optical scientists, and psychologists), and discussions beyond the exhibition stage that will involve other interested parties (scholars, students and the general public). The outcome will be the exhibition itself, a multi-media event incorporating images, historical artifacts, and interactive encounters with the materials. The whole will offer scholars and the public the opportunity to re-evaluate the experience of seeing and visualising, while further exploring the changes in knowing and understanding offered by new technologies so that a wider debate about the nature of representation can be joined between those who practice art and those who analyse it.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18361</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E506054/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8BB67751-1AD5-4EE8-9104-089D5F236DDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Digital Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1BF93D24-EF76-46A8-848B-CCD6008D74BC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Photography HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
