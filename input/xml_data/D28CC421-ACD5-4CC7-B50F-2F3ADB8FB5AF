The proposed activity will investigate if this system has commercial potential and will evaluate the next steps necessary to maximise the contribution this invention can make to UK competitiveness. This will include an evaluation of the market for the low-cost UAV technology; clarification of the regulatory restrictions of UAV operations for civilian applications; a review of patents and opportunities for protection of the idea; and evaluating possible partners and initiating contacts with them. The system includes a vehicle with at least 1000km range that can carry 2kg of sensors, a launcher that enables take off without a runway (e.g. from a research ship), a command and control station, an autopilot (so that the aircraft flies itself under computer control), and electronics for managing sensors. The UAV can be programmed to fly to a series of positions using GPS (satellite) positioning. Whilst commercial UAV systems exist, they are either expensive (the most suitable system costs ~$300k), or could not operate from remote locations (e.g. from a research ship). The unique selling point of this UAV system is its high performance at low cost. Low cost has been built into all flight systems resulting in a vehicle that is at least ten times cheaper than the current commercial systems. The UAV is designed to land on water, or to skid land on a hard surface. With this in mind the fuselage is extremely rugged, and will survive a crash landing at sea. This means that it will float and protect the valuable avionics, sensors, and electronic systems. If the landing is hard (a soft landing is possible) the wings and tail will break, but these are designed to be cheap and replaceable. Together these design decisions mean that the system is much cheaper to operate in hostile conditions. With over 1000km of range, and a large sensor payload the UAV can also cover a lot of ground / ice / ocean before a landing is necessary and can therefore return a lot of data. Civilian applications for low-cost UAV technology could include (amongst numerous others): oceanographic study in support of, or augmenting, a research vessel, search for rescue missions, forest fire/flood/disaster assessment, pipeline assessment and policing duties. Clarification of the current and future regulatory controls for such missions is critical in defining the market size and this is integral to the proposed study.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8216</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>That at the time of this market survey, regulation was the key block to low-cost oceanographic UAV deployment and hence markets.
