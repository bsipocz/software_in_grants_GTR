African drylands</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/I003673/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>BEST addresses the research issue that African drylands are fast approaching a tipping point of range enclosure, with associated loss of wild and domestic grazer mobility, and attendant loss of ecosystem services and of poor people's livelihoods. The shift to an enclosed (or conversely back to an open) state is driven by the interplay of changing policies on land tenure and natural resource management. The effects of these policies, which are integrated at the level of household tradeoff decisions and subsequent land use choices, are expressed in environmental and social sustainability implications. BEST asks the research question: How do different policy and economic drivers shape household decisions on land use choices, and with what ecosystem services and poverty implications? BEST's objectives are therefore: (1) to develop a conceptually innovative approach focusing on the intersection of changing land tenure and NRM policies and their impact on tipping drylands from open, resilient rangelands with mobile domestic and wild animals and often cash-poor but relatively secure and resilient pastoral livelihoods, into a closed, impoverished state (2) to leverage existing datasets (biophysical and socioeconomic), extract maximum analytical power and develop policy relevant lessons from cross-border comparative analyses of Kenya/ Ethiopia Boran and Kenya/Tanzania Maasai systems (3) to model household-level decisions on drylands resource use choices in different policy and economic contexts, integrating biophysical and socioeconomic dimensions, maintaining a disaggregated level of analysis across household types and conditions, and exploring policy and economic incentives fostering conservation-compatible choices (4) to develop policy scenario evaluations to support better ecosystem management, making more visible and comprehensible poor people's resource use choices, and enhancing their livelihoods (5) to build on local knowledge, engaging stakeholders at all levels, through networking, field consultation, workshops, and media outputs, from concept to beyond project end. BEST will also share knowledge and build capacity across the whole partnership and beyond, through collaborative working, stakeholder engagement and a wide range of outputs pitched at policy as well as scientific audiences - to build capacity across the collaboration and beyond, - to ensure maximum impact, leveraging dissemination through non-funded project partners, research and practitioner networks alongside the stakeholder engagement activities BEST research design, methods and materials use conceptually innovative modelling, alongside major extant datasets, and a cross-border comparative analysis encompassing three of the poorest African countries, to develop understanding of household decisions over land use. The BEST partnership combines in depth experience of the biophysical and socioecological dimensions of the ecosystems studied, advanced modelling capabilities, and outstanding experience in communications and engagement, with significant research, policymaker and practitioner networks. UK and non-UK members of the BEST partnership already manage major datasets necessary for the work. Together with non-funded partners ASARECA, STEPS and TAWIRI, and the involvement of BEST research partners with current research collaborations, the BEST partnership aims not only to deliver findings that will help evaluate policy scenarios, giving credible and relevant insight into the ecosystem services and poverty implications of different land tenure and NRM policies, but also to ensure those findings and tools are embedded into policymaking and practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>224479</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Poverty Conservation Learning Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Poverty Conservation Learning Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>34F25439-F4CE-475B-B508-696556767590</gtr:id><gtr:impact>information, dissemination and critical feedback network of user groups at the conservation/development interface</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b9dbab78b9dbab96-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>PCLG provides a network of considerable international and multilevel reach which is active in disseminating findings and garnering feedback from user groups. they are performing this role for the present PIMA project but also for subsequent ESPA_funded work (IMPACTS project: PI Emily Woodhouse)</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>KH joined the Poverty Conservation Learning Group http://povertyandconservation.info/.

Practitioners from government agencies to NGOs need the findings to improve the performance of PWC interventions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation. Donors need the findings and approach in order to evaluate which interventions have been effective and to what extent, where, how and why, making optimal allocation of scarce resources possible.

In-depth stakeholder engagement, from pre-project through to project completion, alongside rigorous, differentiated analyses, have delivered robust findings which are being checked against local knowledge at grassroots, national and regional levels. Incorporating and building on that feedback, findings are being communicated at every level, from local community meetings to media outputs (web, radio, print) to policymaker, practitioner and community representative meetings, through to scientific reports and peer-reviewed papers. Local summaries and media outputs are produced in English, Maa and Swahili. Co-investigators are all active across wide networks of scientific activity, with findings being disseminated through their attendance at and presentations to international meeting, and through their contributions as expert members of panels and boards formulating new research agendas, reviewing funding applications and refereeing subsequent publications., as well as through the new research programmes they themselves initiate and lead.

Through the outputs described in preceding sections we expect this work to have significant impact on practice in Kenya and Tanzania, and more broadly across Africa . we also expect significant impact on donor and international agendas, national policymaking, and on the state of scientific knowledge.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>57B115C7-5CBA-4846-BAC0-50DDB8A886D1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-5255957325.227519de277f38</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>East African rangelands represent a hotspot of both biodiversity and pastoralist production. While pastoralism underpins livelihoods and national GDP, most pastoralists remain in poverty. Although savanna wildlife draws tourist revenues important to the national economy, wildlife populations are in sharp decline. This research asks how policy and economic incentives may be used to encourage more environmentally and socially sustainable land use and livelihoods choices. Building on past ethnographic and ecological work in East African rangelands, BEST used economic games, choice experiments, and modeling to explore pastoralist household decision-making in Kenya and Tanzania Maasailand. Key findings reveal the relative values placed on livestock, crops, cash investments and income from conservation set-aside. They show the ways that land use and livelihoods choices shift with changing levels of payment for wildlife conservation, with household wealth, and with land tenure policies. They reveal unanticipated links between conservation set-aside, illegal grazing and household wealth, and an unexpected shift back from cattle to small stock with dwindling communal grazing land. Men and women's preferences diverge in unexpected ways with respect to species herded (women prefer cattle, which yield milk for the household food system, where men see market profit in shifting to small stock) and with respect to men's cash earnings (to which women have little or no access).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>BES findings have been disseminated and incorporated into national and international policy guidelines and advisory bodies as listed elsewhere on Researchfish

Following consultation with policymakers, practitioners, community leaders and tourism entrepreneurs, the following applications of the BEST approach and findings are still being considered: 

? local language summaries illustrated by a local artist 

? video showing how different scenarios or economic games develop through time, with for example land areas shrinking, herds growing or declining, etc

? app for mobile phones or a simple computer version of the games for use as a learning tool among pastoralists, helping to demonstrate the value of appropriate herd management decisions

? radio broadcasts in the vernacular 

? further field visits using local learning networks (eg via elders, traditional leaders such as Maasai Ilaigwenan, etc) 

? more participatory exercises around additional variants of the games
 Project findings have been presented to policymakers, practitioners and communities as well as other researchers, through a series of in-country workshop and field-based meetings and documents. The team are now preparing policy briefings and parliamentary concept notes for use at this key policy moment, with respective governments preparing to implement Kenya's Vision 2030 and Tanzania's Vision 2025. In-country project team members (ILRI, ATPS) have key roles in these policy processes. The team is also exploring further media outputs, including local language outputs for wider public dissemination, alongside scientific publications.



In addition to these routes to exploitation of the results, BEST findings and approach form the basis for a further ESPA-funded research programme 2013-2106, exploring the social and environmental outcomes of wildlife management areas in Tanzania.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>374AA22F-C271-417F-A910-DFF694BC6A0B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1672261750.02033047758e3f2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/best/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>National Policy for sustainable development of northern Kenya and other arid lands</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0FF15F3D-7CA5-4906-9455-268BE6BA2A05</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mohammed Said was involved in the review of the ASAL and Environmental policies in Kenya.
