A critical function of the epithelial lining is to form a barrier separating airways containing everything a person will inhale with the underlying lung tissue and by extension the rest of their body. This cell barrier is regulated by apical junctional complexes, which are connections between cells. They act as gates to control the access of a wide variety of substances from entry into the lung tissue below. One component of these junctions is the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR). CAR is the primary receptor and therefore entry point for most Adenovirus serotypes in many different cell types and is predominantly found to the baso-lateral surface of polarised epithelium, essentially the area of the cells that is least in contact with the airway. Our recent studies suggest that CAR additionally plays a role in regulating how cells link with one another and also convey messages within individual cells. Disruption of cell junctions and increased epithelial permeability are features of asthma. We hypothesise that epithelial cell junction maintenance is regulated by CAR and another protein (E-cadherin, which we have shown to interact with CAR) within cell membranes and that disruption of junctions in asthma promotes viral infection and inflammation through CAR-mediated intracellular signalling. We propose to address this hypothesis by comprehensively analysing the role of CAR in cell junction formation, stability and signalling to E-cadherin in human bronchial epithelial cells. We will then assess the effect of biologically relevant challenges on CAR and E-cadherin dynamics at junctions and extend key observations from these studies to epithelial cells taken directly from normal volunteers and patients with asthma. Finally, we will use an organotypic model to evaluate CAR responses to different challenges. This model is useful as it essentially creates an artificial airway by growing epithelial cells on a matrix that mimics the conditions found within lung tissue. It thereby ensures that investigations can be undertaken in a more physiologically relevant environment. The results obtained from this research will contribute to our understanding of the pathways regulating dynamics of cell junction formation and disruption in normal and asthmatic airway epithelium. Such information is vital when considering treatments for asthma and inflammation in the lung as it offers alternative targets for drug therapy in asthma. Importantly there is also significant crossover with other disease processes within the lung, as disruption in the cell junctions is relevant to all forms of infection as well as metastasis in cancers.
This work will be undertaken in the Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology department at Guy's hospital. This department has a long and productive history in studying asthma and will therefore provide an outstanding environment in which to study this complex field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The study sets out to identify how Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) functions in bronchial epithelial cells in order to create tight junctions and then focus on how this plays a role in patients with asthma. In order to address this question, bronchial epithelial cell lines have been developed that either over or under express CAR. These will then be challenged by biologically relevant cytokines (including IL 5 &amp;amp; 13) to determine the importance of CAR in their response. This will be undertaken by several methods, including western blotting and a variety of imaging techniques. Importantly a more physiologically relevant model will be incorporated into the project to provide additional insights. An organotypic model will be used as this will grow the epithelial cells in a three dimensional structure to mimic to some degree the natural environment found in airways. The study will also create phosphorylation specific antibodies and test with further imaging and biochemistry techniques for the integrins and structural proteins activated and controlled by CAR localised to junctions. Finally primary cell culture and histological staining of normal and asthmatic patients bronchial samples will determine whether our greater understanding of changes in CAR function are playing a key role in the biology of asthma. These advances will have a broad range of benefits for other scientists as a greater understanding of the importance of CAR in tight junctions will advance all work in the complicated biology of epithelial cell interaction. Given that defects in this epithelial interaction, in particular tight junction formation, have been shown to be relevant to many disease processes such as asthma and cancer biology there are also opportunities for identifying new targets for medical treatments.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The study will provide significant detail regarding the role of Coxsackie and Adenoviral Receptor (CAR) in tight junction formation and with it epithelial cell interaction. The association with the disruption of tight junctions and asthma has been clearly demonstrated. Therefore a greater understanding how CAR is involved in the process will provide the pathways and molecular targets necessary for work to provide alternative drug classes in the management of asthma. This is vital as asthma is heterogeneous disease entity and as such a wide spectrum of treatment options are required to control its symptoms in many people.
The disruption of CAR in tight junctions is not an issue confined to asthma alone. For example the expression levels of CAR have connected tumour metastasis. Therefore by showing how CAR functions and is regulated in cell junctions it would identify targets to control tumour spread.
By undertaking the project Dr Hicks will personally gain significant research competence. This will include practical laboratory skills, including advanced microscopy knowledge. This will be augmented by more esoteric but equally valuable expertise in project design and management. This will place him in a strong position to apply for a NIHR postdoctoral post such as an Academic Clinical Lectureship and eventually form his own research group.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>137213</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A04C52DB-F0B9-4E4A-97C2-1CA9602FDE23</gtr:id><gtr:title>TNFa promotes CAR-dependent migration of leukocytes across epithelial monolayers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9dfcca1ceb3e2ca61bd5a510dbdc8eb3"><gtr:id>9dfcca1ceb3e2ca61bd5a510dbdc8eb3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morton PE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b7eb7cd567c5.39308784</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CC5C591B-4FC7-4D15-9B17-EF7CD68D6863</gtr:id><gtr:title>CAR regulates epithelial cell junction stability through control of E-cadherin trafficking.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9dfcca1ceb3e2ca61bd5a510dbdc8eb3"><gtr:id>9dfcca1ceb3e2ca61bd5a510dbdc8eb3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morton PE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_22875__srep02889</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB9C31E4-7863-4C58-9C01-34954529A522</gtr:id><gtr:title>ALK rearrangements in EBUS-derived transbronchial needle aspiration cytology in lung cancer.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cytopathology : official journal of the British Society for Clinical Cytology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/682afdef0bd446c9e21198b0a0eb8f34"><gtr:id>682afdef0bd446c9e21198b0a0eb8f34</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Neat MJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0956-5507</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_22875_25_23551582</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K002597/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>E3CED108-9B11-45C4-A81B-3730D641CA68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Respiratory</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
