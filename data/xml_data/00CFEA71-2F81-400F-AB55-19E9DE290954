Alvin Roth spoke on the topic 'Who gets what? The new economics of matchmaking and market design'; and showed that markets do not always, and in fact sometimes are not allowed to, involve money. In these matching markets, one cannot only choose, but has to be chosen, and they involve some of the most important transitions in life: Who gets places at schools, universities, jobs, or a scarce organ transplant? An increased public awareness of these insights is not directly measurable, but Roth's excellent presentation was received with outstanding enthusiasm by the audience.
In terms of academic impact, some of the contacts made at these workshops have led to invitations at other universities to seminars and conferences, and increased collaboration. For example, the last workshop on algorithmic game theory (which had also a larger number of speakers than the others) can be seen as a constituent first meeting which should have follow-ups. The existing research ties in this community will strengthen further.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>76994D73-BCDD-4F44-9CAD-6E12B602713A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54bf9a8f303d29.51750773</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Game theory provides mathematical concepts for the study of competition and cooperation. It has proved fruitful in economics, political science, biology, and other disciplines, and lately received considerable attention in studies of interactions on the internet. In this project, ESRC sponsored five short workshops in the UK on a different specific topic of game theory. At each workshop, internationally renowned scholars as well as more junior researchers for the UK, including research students, met, usually for a day, for presentations and discussions around a theme of current interest.

The workshops demonstrated the breadth of applications of game theory. They took place with scholars of the highest international standing, including Nobel Prize winner Alvin Roth at a workshop in February 2013 at LSE on &amp;quot;Matching under preferences&amp;quot;. Roth showed that markets can be designed even where money cannot be used, such as an exchange of partners for kidney donation to find compatible pair of donors and recipients of kidneys. This public talk attracted enormous interest also to the lay public.

We mention two other workshops that took place with pioneers on the topic: &amp;quot;Correlation and coordination in games&amp;quot; (June 2011 at LSE) treated strategic information transmission where an &amp;quot;agent&amp;quot; (such as franchise operator of a large company) has more information than the &amp;quot;principal&amp;quot; he works for, but only the latter can take action (such as investing in the franchise). It can be quantified the agent gives the more information the more his interests are aligned with the principal. Another workshop on &amp;quot;Algorithmic Game Theory&amp;quot; (October 2013 at LSE) dealt with questions concerning the optimal design of economic transactions on the internet, for example how Google should price advertisements alongside its search results. The best way to do this is via auctions that are automatically determined for each search. The game-theoretic analysis has shown how to maximize revenue, which is the main income for Google with tens of billions of dollars per year.

The key findings and goals were to inform UK-based researchers of recent developments in Game Theory; to facilitate the generation of new ideas and new research projects that advance the frontier of our knowledge in Game Theory and its applications; to expose junior academics based in the UK to the work that is being done at the frontier of these rapidly expanding fields; and to foster links between junior researchers in the UK and major researchers outside the UK. These goals were fully achieved, as the enthusiastic response of the participants testified.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The matching theory presented in the February 2016 workshop of &amp;quot;Matching under Preferences&amp;quot; has important applications in healthcare, where kidney patient-donor pairs that are medically incompatible can nevertheless take part in &amp;quot;chains&amp;quot; of exchanges where alternative donors are used that are compatible, to the benefit of all involved. In the UK, these chains have so far been short and limited to two or three pairs of patients and donors. The presented research, in particular by Professor Alvin Roth, shows from experiences in the US that much longer chains are possible, in particular if there is a &amp;quot;single&amp;quot; donor (deceased or alive) who does not have a matching recipient, so that the operations do not have to take simultaneously but can be performed sequentially.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DF828611-297F-404B-BD7B-8E4FA02171AD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545d5491c61ef3.02727710</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/ESRC_Game_Theory_Workshop.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I002936/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>3F6E94B4-4294-4337-B039-59BD3F491C91</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/I002936/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>18293.68</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>00CFEA71-2F81-400F-AB55-19E9DE290954</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/I002936/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>13422.35</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-10-29</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
