Stem cells hold the promise of rejuvenating tissues to treat human disease but achieving this will be difficult unless more is known about their regulation. In recent years a significant body of work has begun to characterise the skin epidermal cells (keratinocytes), which have an enormous proliferative potential under optimum in vitro conditions and recent work has shown that somatic stem cells do undergo ageing in vivo as well as senescence in vitro. Therefore, understanding the regulation of somatic stem cells sufficiently to rejuvenate or expand them in situ by transient pharmaceutical intervention has longer term appeal, provided that at least some stem cells remain in the tissue. However, increasing stem cell numbers without increasing the risk of cancer is very difficult as many of the pathways known to increase stem cell number and function also promote neoplasia. The enzyme telomerase is a large protein complex composed of whose established (canonical) function is to maintain the TTAGGG repeats at the ends of human chromosomes (telomeres) and prevent the chromosome ends being recognised as DNA double strand breaks. This function of telomerase prevents one mechanism of ageing but provokes an increased risk of cancer. In addition there is now good evidence that telomerase has other (non-canonical) functions. In particular, recent work has suggested that telomerase can promote stem cell self-renewal and functional maintenance without an increased risk of cancer, thereby identifying the non-canonical functions of telomerase as a target for drugs that increase stem cell numbers and function. However, it is very unclear how telomerase activates keratinocyte stem cells. To address this we have used a human keratinocyte in vitro model system and a variant of telomerase that possesses only the non-canonical functions of the enzyme. We have shown that the non-canonical function of telomerase may increase keratinocyte survival when the cells are denied attachment to the epidermal basement membrane and this could contribute to the ability of stem cells to survive outside the stem cell environment (the niche). Our proposal seeks to investigate the molecular mechanism by which telomerase blocks death by anchorage deprivation (anoikis) by using two distinct approaches. Firstly, we will systematically probe the known pathways involved in keratinocyte anoikis to identify the precise point at in the extracellular matrix survival signalling mechanism where telomerase interferes with the process. As telomerase has been reported to regulate some extracellular matrix receptors (integrins), we will test whether any of the ones whose expression is altered by telomerase are modified by the non-canonical functions of telomerase. If any are up regulated we will seek to obtain proof of their functional involvement by either blocking or enhancing their function. If the integrins are not altered by telomerase, we will proceed to investigate the known downstream effectors of integrin-mediated survival, to test whether their expression or function is enhanced by telomerase and whether interfering with their function rescues anoikis in cells expressing telomerase.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Telomerase is a large protein complex composed of at least two essential components, the reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit, hTERT and the RNA component, hTERC, which acts as a template for the synthesis of TTAGGG repeats by hTERT (the canonical function). In addition there is now good evidence that telomerase has non-canonical functions, which include the stimulation of keratinocyte stem cell division, migration and self renewal. We have shown that a variant telomerase (TERT-HA), which lacks the canonical function, can block suspension-induced apoptosis (anoikis) in HaCaT cells without lengthening telomeres but the molecular mechanism is unclear. We will test whether ectopic TERT-HA leads to the inappropriately sustained expression and function of the keratinocyte integrins, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 6, alpha v, beta1, beta 4, beta 5 and beta 6. Candidate integrins will be investigated further by blocking antibodies, RNA interference (RNAi) or alpha v/null human keratinocytes to test whether their up regulated function is essential for the effects of TERT-HA on anoikis. If the integrins are not the primary target of TERT-HA expression, we will test for the reduced activation of candidate caspases using fluorescence and Western blot-based protein cleavage assays. We will also test for increased activation or expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Akt and PI3 kinase by using Western blotting and antibodies specific for the total and phosphorylated forms of the proteins. Intervention will depend on the initial results but will involve well established pharmaceutical intervention, RNAi or dominant-negative mutant approaches. These experiments will establish a preliminary description of the point at which TERT interferes with anoikis. Interesting results from the HaCaT system will be extended to normal keratinocyte stem cells isolated by their rapid adhesion to collagen type IV.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>286782</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0B93D887-A6A5-44FC-810A-CDE34E88A899</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented at the International Telomerase and Telomeres Conference at Cold Spring Harbor New York</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5c88773f992.93714119</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>120000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Dunhill Medical Trust</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Dunhill Medical Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>R452/1115</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>65BB9DDD-7118-49AF-B22E-343A205BD1DA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d835e0d558e4.06486965</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>? Telomerase increases the expression of TAp63 . 

? These phenotypes are independent of the telomere lengthening or catalytic functions of telomerase.

? The increase in TAp63 was evident at the transcriptional level.

? The high levels of TAp63 were not due to a shift towards a population of keratinocytes expressing high amounts of the protein but instead were due to an average increase in the whole population.

? There was no evidence of increased Wnt signalling.

? These results are significant because TAp63 is a keratinocyte stem cell marker and can promote senescence and apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, deletion of the full length TAp63 together with DeltaNp63 in vivo accelerates epidermal ageing in vivo.

? Preliminary data also showed that physiological levels of telomerase may affect HaCaT keratinocyte migration in the in vitro scratch assay that simulates wounding.

There was no evidence on further investigation that telomerase affects sensitivity to TGF Beta or anoikis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Increased TAp63 may have potential as a biomarker of the action of certain drugs.

As such are unlikely to act as dominant-negative mutants as previously suggested but may be a way of reducing the total amount of available functional TERT in situations such as wound repair and development.
