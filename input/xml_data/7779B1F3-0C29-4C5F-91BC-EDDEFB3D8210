These proteins adopt complicated, often beautiful three-dimensional structures that enable them to orchestrate an enormous range of processes in every one of the 37 trillion (or so) cells in our bodies - from defending us against life-threatening microbes and ensuring that healthy cells do not become cancerous, to carrying oxygen around our blood and digesting our food. Proteins keep us alive and enable us to see, hear, feel, smell and taste. They do more for us than we even know about yet. And the instructions for making them are in our genes.

Because our genes play this important role, copies of them are passed on to the daughter cells every time our cells divide. This means almost all of those trillions of cells in our bodies have copies of all our genes - around 20,000 at the last count, encoding 20,000 different proteins. But if all of the cells in our body have identical genes, why aren't eye cells the same as heart cells, or skin cells, or nerve cells, or blood cells? Clearly there needs to be some way of controlling which cells make which proteins - in other words, which genes are 'switched on' and which are 'switched off'. How this happens is investigated in a field of research called 'epigenetics'. To use an analogy - our genes are the notes on the page of a musical score that give instructions on how to play a tune. A group of musicians could play those notes in all sorts of different ways - epigenetics describes the way in which the notes are played i.e. how our genes are 'expressed'.

Recently, a new network of proteins (proteins again, since another job performed by proteins is to regulate which other proteins get made) that switches certain genes off has been discovered by researchers in Cambridge. They named the network the 'human silencing hub', or 'HUSH complex' for short. My project aims to discover how and why the HUSH complex works.

To do this, I aim to discover what the proteins that make up the HUSH complex look like in three dimensions, how they move and interact with one another. As described above, proteins adopt very specific shapes in order to perform their particular functions in a cell, so identifying their shape can be important in understanding how they work. This is known as 'structural biology'. 

In partnership with the group that discovered the HUSH complex, I aim to understand how the HUSH complex silences specific genes, and its relevance to human health and development. It is thought that it could be important in cells that are threatened with viral infection, for example HIV. Using structural biology, we hope to better understand how proteins work together to stop our DNA from being 'read' at particular points i.e. stop particular genes from being 'expressed'. This will advance our understanding of human biology and epigenetics. Furthermore, it may be possible to use that knowledge to develop tools and therapies that can interfere with the HUSH complex, that would be useful treatments for diseases that occur if the complex malfunctions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Heterochromatin, a variety of chromatin in which the DNA is more tightly packaged, is associated with repression of genes and its regulation is linked to the histone code, for example tri-methylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9me3). The positioning of a gene into heterochromatin may result in epigenetic silencing of that gene: this effect is also known as position-effect variegation (PEV). By using forward genetic screens analogous to those used in Drosophila melanogaster to search for genes involved in PEV in human cells, Lehner and co-workers have recently identified, characterized and reported a novel complex involved in transcriptional silencing at new sites of retroviral integration: the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex. The chromodomain of one HUSH complex member, MPP8, can bind to H3K9me3, but other details of the assembly, mechanism and regulation of the multi-protein complex at the molecular level are not understood. In particular, the 1670-amino acid, hitherto uncharacterized protein TASOR (transgene activation suppressor) appears to be a critical component of the HUSH complex. This project will establish a collaboration between the laboratories of Professor Yorgo Modis and Professor Paul Lehner in the University of Cambridge Department of Medicine to provide a deep mechanistic understanding of the role of TASOR in transcriptional repression by the HUSH complex using structural, biophysical and chemical biology approaches.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The exposure of this research will extend beyond my immediate academic network and wider academic beneficiaries via publication in top-tier peer-reviewed journals. Epigenetics is a fascinating and fast-moving area of the biological sciences and this project, if communicated properly, will engage and inspire the wider general public. The UK is a world leader in this field and we will benefit as a society from continuing to push the boundaries of what is known about healthy growth and development, of which epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are clearly a vital part. The project will be a small part of a wider effort to ensure that the UK biomedical research community remains competitive and groundbreaking in what is a truly international field. Furthermore, epigenetics is an active area of drug development, and projects such as this, examining a new system of transcriptional silencing, will immediately benefit those in pharmaceutical and related industries. The results could also benefit patients (albeit beyond the timescale of the fellowship), since it is likely that (mal)function of the HUSH complex, which silences transcription at sites of retroviral integration, will have important implications in human health and disease. Basic research into the mechanism of the HUSH complex will be vital to understanding any translational research further down the line. Therefore, the proposed project has the potential to benefit both the nation's wealth and health in the long term, reinforcing the notion that funding such projects represents excellent value for the taxpayer.
