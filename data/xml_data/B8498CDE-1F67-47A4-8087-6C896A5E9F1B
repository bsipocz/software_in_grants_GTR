Whilst in most patients the liver remains unharmed, a significant number of patients progress to inflammation and scarring, which can ultimately lead to liver failure and liver cancer. At present, there is no way to predict who may develop inflammation and scarring, nor any effective treatment.

My own recent work has suggested a theory that genes controlling scarring can be modified during our lifetime to influence the rate at which liver disease will progress.

My proposal aims to extend my initial results; I will use liver samples from animals and patients to determine whether the modifications in genes change over the course of disease or whether they were present before advanced disease developed. I will assess where these gene changes arise in the liver, which other genes may be subject to this gene modification and whether it occurs in other cells in the body, specifically the blood.

The results from this proposal are important and relevant to the patient; they will present opportunities to advance our understanding why some patients with fatty liver form scars, to predict those patients and to potentially treat liver scarring.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum encompassing steatosis, steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is the commonest cause of liver dysfunction worldwide; the fastest rising in the UK. Whilst the majority of patients with the metabolic syndrome develop steatosis, only a minority go on to develop cirrhosis. Therefore, advances in understanding the pathogenesis and risk factors of progressive disease are urgently needed.

I recently reported data suggesting an association between epigenetic remodelling of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARg) by DNA Methylation and disease progression in human NAFLD. I now aim to determine the mechanism by which epigenetic remodelling may influence disease progression.

Methods
Pyrosequencing for quantitative DNA Methylation analysis:-
Tissue from animals with dietary induced NAFLD, &amp;gt;100 serial liver biopsies of patients with steatosis or progressive NAFLD, and laser dissection microscopy to assess whether DNA Methylation of PPARg is pre-set before disease, whether it changes as a consequence of disease progression and in which other genes and liver cells it occurs. I will assess whether these changes are seen in blood.

Scientific/Medical opportunities
This project is clinically relevant because it will further our understanding of the molecular events that lead to disease progression in NAFLD. Greater understanding of the nature of epigenetic gene changes may in the future outwith this project help to identify novel markers of NAFLD disease progression risk that could be used as part of stratified medicine to individualise patient assessment for importance of lifestyle modification, need for follow up and future anti-fibrotic drug development and trial enrichment.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal tests a hypothesis, which if correct, would reveal a previously unknown regulatory pathway in disease progression in Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the commonest cause of liver dysfunction in the Western World.

Besides the academic beneficiaries of the work, the ultimate beneficiaries will of course be patients with NAFLD. They are unlikely to benefit directly from the research; the work is intended to improve our understanding of disease progression in NALFD, such that patients can benefit indirectly in the following ways:

-Development of pharmacological therapies.

The identification of a novel mechanism for regulation of disease progression in NAFLD could lead to the identification of drug targets, which in turn might lead to a widely effective antifibrotic therapy, which currently does not exist. This would likely take several years before human trials could be conducted. 

-Improved understanding.

The mechanisms uncovered in this research should lead to better understanding of the disease process. This would stimulate multiple avenues of subsequent new research as detailed in the academic beneficiaries; ultimately this new knowledge would be used to inform new treatment.

-Prediction of disease progression
 
Currently doctors do not have tools to predict who will develop severe liver disease in NAFLD. The proposed work will assess whether the mechanisms uncovered can also be demonstrated in the blood; this could lead to more research into predictive blood markers of severe liver disease and spare patients the risks of liver biopsy, currently the gold standard for assessing disease progression. This new predictive information would allow better designing of drug trials for new antifibrotic therapies.


Additionally, all chronic liver diseases share fibrosis as the final common pathway in disease progression. Therefore, the proposed research by uncovering a novel mechanism in NAFLD disease fibrosis progression may benefit patients with all subtypes of chronic liver disease, not just NAFLD.

Disease progression in other organs such as the lung, kidney and skin also share fibrosis as the final common pathway, therefore patients with fibrotic lung, kidney and skin disease may benefit from the proposed research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>193370</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School Visit to Hospital</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E421147-0A6E-493F-963C-F6B63BB1602E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>20 pupils attended for a school visit to the Freeman Hospital, which sparked questions and discussion afterwards surrounding application to Medical school.
