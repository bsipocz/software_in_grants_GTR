Mobilising for the Self-Certification of Food</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M011291/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>With growing concerns over the quality of what we eat, food has moved to the centre of questions over governance and sovereignty. However, in mainstream studies of food and activism, a focus on culture, identity and the creativity of ethical activism still often forecloses the capacity to address broader issues of governance. 

Following Bourdieu's (2014) call to consider resistance as a lens to understand the evolution of contemporary forms of power, this project investigates innovative political activism relating to the right to certify food. The rapidly growing network of independent small-scale farmers 'Genuinely Clandestine' (GC) throughout Italy promotes alternative, 'participatory self-certifications' of so-called 'genuine' local food chains. Created in 2010 as an ironic 'anti-logo', the label GC has expanded to a national network throughout Italy. With the GC label, groups organise markets, festivals and events selling deliberately local products that do not conform to current food safety regulations. In contrast to depersonalised, top-down certification practices considered as driven by agribusiness interests, 'participatory self-certifications' are set up locally in consumer-producer assemblies. As a particularly rich laboratory of food politics, for decades Italy's cultural capital has been considered an incubator for similar vanguard food movements that have spread around the world, including Slow Food, local food chains and resistance to EU regulations. However, the proliferation of alterative certifications differs radically in scope and objectives from previous forms of rural resistance; it challenges the right of state authorities to certify, addressing a key issue of contemporary governance. This form of activism is likely to spread internationally over the next years.

Based on observational methods and participatory cinema, this project unfolds around an in-depth ethnographic fieldwork related to the micropolitics of participatory self-certification. We will consider these within their broader web of relations with consumers, authorities and producers. In practice, who takes decisions? Who contests them? What new challenges pose self-certification to the authorities? The fieldwork will allow us to address broader questions of what these novel forms of activism tell us about changing forms of sovereignty, how is 'trust' in products produced; and, how social relations between consumers, farmers and producers are reconfigured.

The innovative potential of the project derives from the approach to situate the political challenge posed by the proliferation of self-certifications within a theoretical framework that combines writing on food activism with critical studies of policy. By re-framing the understanding of food activism in relation to wider issues of governance and sovereignty, rather than in terms of identity and culture, we will question the implicit assumption in the literature on food and activism of a growing unidirectional normalisation of everyday life and its evolution towards multiple, contested forms of standardisations. In addition, this theme will highlight the role of rural peripheries as laboratories for political innovation, often considered in mainstream literature as static and back-warded.

Embedded in activities of the European network Anthropology and Social Movements (founded and coordinated by the PI) and building upon relations developed in a ESRC interdisciplinary study, the results of this research will be delivered in form of one ethnographic monograph to a prestigious university press and in form of a major interdisciplinary research article. In addition, we will produce a documentary in order to disseminate the researchfindings. In addition, we will work with a coalition of policy makers that elaborates a vanguard legislative initiative for the Italian parliament, drawing on self-certifications as a means to lift bureaucratic burdens of small-scale farmers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will aim to have an impact on (1) independent small-scale farmers and food producers members of the network 'Genuinely Clandestine' (GC) in Italy, (2) high profile agricultural policy-makers who currently elaborate vanguard initiatives to recognise self-certifications as a means to lift bureaucratic burdens for farmers, including legislative change, (3) food activist networks across Italy and the UK, and (4) policy makers of the Food Standard Authority (FSA) in order to learn from 'good practices'.

1. Most immediately, the project will raise the visibility of independent small-scale famers and food producers in Italy who are part of the GC network. The long-term fieldwork will give producers and farmers the opportunity to carefully voice their concerns. Research subjects will be involved in the production of a documentary, a monograph and a research article, as described in the pathways attachment. The outcomes of the project offer opportunities to inspire and motivate activism and foster new collaborations between farmers, consumers and policy-makers alike. 
2. The project outcomes aim to influence policy makers involved in a landmark initiative that aims to recognise simplified 'participatory self-certifications'. These will facilitate the possibilities for independent small-scale farmers to sell their products, simplifying current EU regulative burdens. The project team will collaborate closely with key-figures of the Italian Confederation of Farmers (CIA), one of the largest EU agricultural associations (see LoS) and their coalition of policy-makers that includes Members of the Italian Parliament and agricultural associations interlinked with the GC network. As a timely and unique policy experiment, it might well become a future model for other EU countries. Currently the initiative does not rely on detailed scientific insights into the potential and limits of self-certifications, but exclusively on activists voices. As outlined in the Pathways document, the research team will deliver its findings on the potential and limits of self-certification in a dedicated policy paper. Thus, the research offers the opportunity to shape next generation food regulations.
3. Through the proposed debate and screening sessions, participating UK activists in London and Belfast will learn about practices of self-certification and the GC network. Both are almost unknown throughout Great Britain's food activist networks, such as Slow Food UK. Participants will learn about good practices, be inspired and motivated in order to think of possible innovative forms of mobilisation. In addition, consumers who participate in the proposed events will engage with the dynamics of self-certification of local products, direct consumer-producer relations and assemblies for food sovereignty.
4. In collaboration with Christopher Elliot (Inst for Global Food Security), the finding of the project will fed into the FSA/ESRC funded project 'Analyses of Food Supply Chains for Risks and Resilience to Food Crime' (of which I am part) in order to access UK stakeholders at the FSA. In particular, we will promote insights that help to implement innovative 'good practices' able to enhance consumer trust in new ways and improve consumer-producer relations around the model of grassroot certifications.

Throughout the project, we will work hard to demonstrate the value that critical theorist Rosa (2012) has described as 'resonating' relationships based on trust and face-to-face contacts. In sum, the project offers much needed insights about the potential and limits of 'participatory self-certifications'. These insights will benefit policy-makers who currently work on a model legislative initiative that draws on these procedures, will raise the profile of network 'Genuinely Clandestine' and sensitise consumers, activists and policy makers alike regarding to the timely question of how we can trust in the food we eat.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157793</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A network of independent small-scale farmers and food producers of Central Italy experiments with the &amp;quot;participatory guarantee&amp;quot;, a set of collective and participatory practices that aims to develop an alternative food quality and safety certification. 
The documentary shows everyday practices and urban-rural relations that constitute the basis of this alternative certification. As an often overseen form of &amp;quot;peasant resistance&amp;quot;, the experiment aims to offer innovative solutions to challenges of food processing at small scales, organic quality standards and the need to prevent black and precarious work conditions.
At the core of the film stands a collective visit for the &amp;quot;participatory guarantee&amp;quot;, in which the main activists of the network have participated. An Experimental Path narrates this certification while a maker of essential oils, cattle breeders, beekeepers and a baker discuss and demonstrate how through this ever changing practice it becomes possible to build innovative networks between peasants and co-producers, and to generate alternative economical circuits and food certifications.
Inscribed in the rhythms of the countryside and the relational efforts of the protagonists, the documentary highlights the difficulty of keeping alive and autonomous an economic and political circuit through local markets, direct food distribution and participation in national peasant movements.
Challenging the system of standardized regulations in agriculture and food processing - which favours large agribusiness - the experimental path of the &amp;quot;participatory guarantee&amp;quot; is a work in progress, highlighting to other farmers, food processors and &amp;quot;co-producers&amp;quot; of the network the possibilities of a different scale of values related to the organic-ness of food and to the mainstream work ethic in the countryside. The objective of the &amp;quot;participatory guarantee&amp;quot; is to build personal relationships of trust through shared visits and the establishment of autonomous food supply chain.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0F34AC9F-08E2-4BA1-AC10-A8BA6B1A94AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The documentary wants to open a reflection on personal experiences of small-scale farmers and as they interact with a broader context. In particular, with the anthropological observation of the actions of protagonists is possible to show the institutional limits and social possibilities of collective practice not recognized by the State.
The documentary raises important questions not only with regard to the management of food safety and how we produce and source food, but also with regard to the politics of transparency and trust.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>583d85d1c53f73.98812125</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>An Experimental Path - (documentary 48') Fabrizio Loce-Mandes</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/183668750</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Perugia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Proving access to &amp;quot;Visual Laboratory&amp;quot; and office space</gtr:description><gtr:id>70A8115C-4DA1-4DAF-9016-17FDCF02B505</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Provision of necessary infrastructure to carry out the research</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5873872c1f0317.96486989-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Perugia provides free-of-charge office space for the Postdoc Fellow associated with the project, as well as free-of-charge access to the &amp;quot;Visual Labpratory&amp;quot;, including high-value technical equipment (cameras, microphone etc)</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Organizing of a conference</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Perugia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Conference sponsering (hospitality), University of Perugia</gtr:description><gtr:id>1867F626-AFEF-461F-AAF3-13158F0C7A1D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The conference was entitles POLITICAL IMAGINATION LABORATORY: Visualizing and Contextualizing Ethnographies of Social Movements.
