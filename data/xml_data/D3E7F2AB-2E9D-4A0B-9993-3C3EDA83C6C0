One major impact was therefore on my career, making it possible for me to apply for and successfully receive a further competitive fellowship from the British Academy.

I developed an existing test of mentalizing, making it quicker and easier to use with individuals with autism. This is now utilised by some clinicians to inform their understanding of individual patients' specific difficulties and needs.

I had the opportunity to talk to a number of professional (clinical &amp;amp; educational) and lay groups both in the UK and abroad about my research. Providing them with a better understanding of the cognitive impairments present in autism can aid professionals to target intervention to the individual and can help carers to model their behaviour around the needs of their child.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9CEF4B41-6F96-4775-A9E0-BBAC4980BDFA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546b7024bfcab6.15339466</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Autism is a developmental disorder with its biological basis in the brain. It encompasses problems in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and the presence of repetitive behaviours and mannerisms. Although several cognitive mechanisms have been suggested, the biological cause has yet to be identified. There may, in fact, be no single underlying cause of ASD, either at the biological or cognitive level of explanation. Indeed, different subgroups of children with ASD seem to have different underlying cognitive impairments and show slightly different patterns of symptoms.

The main aim of the fellowship was to study these cognitive subgroups, in order to better characterise the problems underlying them and the behaviours resulting from them. 

Towards this aim, I was able to develop a test of mentalizing, the ability to understand what another person is thinking and feeling, for use in assessing mentalizing difficulties in autism. This test is now less subjective and quicker to use, making it more feasible for inclusion in research studies and clinical assessments. It is now widely used in such contexts.

I was able to study mentalizing through eye-tracking techniques, which allowed us to detect persisting difficulties in adults with autism that had previously been overlooked, but also showed that such adults are able to detect social interactions even when they don't understand them.

I followed up my previous finding that the increased head/brain size/weight in some individuals with autism is related to a detail-focussed processing style. In this follow-up study, we found that typically-developing children with larger heads did not show this detail focus.

I began my first brain imaging study relating to cognitive heterogeneity in autism, which was completed as part of a different fellowship/grant. We compared children with autism who performed poorly on mentalizing tasks with children with autism who performed well on such tasks. The brain activity of these latter children was atypical however, just like those children with autism who performed poorly on mentalizing tasks. This revealed that those children with autism and good mentalizing task performance must be compensating for such problems.

I was involved in a study comparing adults with and without autism who either did or did not also have alexithymia ('no words for feelings'). We found that alexithymia, but not autism, was related to the ability to empathise with others' feelings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The point of my work has not been whether there are significant group differences between children with and without autism, since this cannot address the question of cause. Rather it deals with individual data in a multiple case study design. I expect this methodology to lead other researchers to consider using individual data and believe this is already starting to happen. Furthermore, my results can inform autism researchers of the lack of universality of the cognitive deficits in autism, as well as their relationships to each other and to behaviour.

My findings also have implications for genetic research. Although we know that ASD is a highly hereditary condition, researchers have been unable to locate and reliably replicate any specific genetic loci for the disorder. I believe that this may be due to the cognitive heterogeneity of ASD, which is likely to result from neurobiological and genetic heterogeneity. This would mean that different samples of children with ASD would contain different combinations of children with different underlying genetics, increasing noise in the data and making it unlikely that the same results would be replicated. Cognitive subgrouping may help to identify different genes in different subgroups.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8824894D-4C18-4C5F-AE55-1E6701DEA0BD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546b77783c1fe2.37161117</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D31B2C65-CD3E-46B1-88CA-6DBE7E9789C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Normal social cognition in developmental prosopagnosia.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognitive neuropsychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e3c1c160bbf6311083a0fb2b6065fa1d"><gtr:id>e3c1c160bbf6311083a0fb2b6065fa1d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Duchaine B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0264-3294</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>541842dbd65d50.09592295</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>41BF19C3-510D-4624-8106-0F3BF2C8EDD3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Performance of children with autism on the Embedded Figures Test: a closer look at a popular task.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of autism and developmental disorders</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/39a83e8049a17d5cca77c094fb1ce808"><gtr:id>39a83e8049a17d5cca77c094fb1ce808</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>White SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0162-3257</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>541842dab940b2.24104858</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>682B9CD1-48D8-4436-BF87-8219EF85E34F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mindblind eyes: an absence of spontaneous theory of mind in Asperger syndrome.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science (New York, N.Y.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dce2da37b383c2ab012f3457ee7adf7d"><gtr:id>dce2da37b383c2ab012f3457ee7adf7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Senju A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0036-8075</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cbfa3bfa3b7b844</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D2D38957-E754-4021-966E-547DAA3C0362</gtr:id><gtr:title>Developing the Frith-Happ&amp;eacute;
