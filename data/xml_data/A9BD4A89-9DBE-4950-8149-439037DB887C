Studies have shown that while Roman occupation of the region certainly had lasting economic and political effects, it is arguable that the adoption of Christianity as the state religion and the monumentalization of the new religion marks one of the most significant social changes to occur in the Peloponnese and Greece since the emergence of the city state in the Archaic period. \nIn light of the dearth of literary and domestic evidence, studies of Late Antique churches provide the most comprehensive body of material for understanding the nature of society during this period. To date, investigations of the topography and architecture of the churches have shown how Christianity spread throughout the Peloponnese from the 5th century onwards (through major urban ports first and then inland to the cities) (Sweetman 2010). Contrary to popular belief, these studies have also indicated that the spread of Christianity was less of a monolithic heavy-handed process of conversion and more of an incentive made through conscious processes of use of memory, identity and insider-groups by constructing churches in specific locations, creating impressive architecture and by making areas of the church accessible to different levels of the congregation in accordance with how far along the religious hierarchy they belong; from unbaptised to catechumens to priests. The phased conversion to Christianity can be read through an examination of the diachronic construction of churches in the urban sphere (few rural churches are known). A preliminary examination has shown that with time, the choice of location of the church becomes more central and thus, self-assured. One of the key aims of this study is to investigate whether later (late 5th and 6th century) churches are constructed in more visible areas of the urban and religious sphere as Christianity makes its foothold more fixed in society. Certainly, the earlier (5th century) and more relaxed approach to Christianization can be seen in the continuation of use of some pre-Christian sanctuaries even after Christianity became the state religion. The evidence for the continuation of use of pre-Christian sanctuaries will be highlighted through studies of epigraphy, and the location, date and function of churches in these sites. \nThis study will show how the visual architectural expression of Christianity consolidated the role of the church in the economic and socio-political life of the Peloponnesian communities. All of this evidence will be contextualized within the broader Mediterranean sphere, with particular reference to three areas of well-published material (Lycia, Cilicia and Cyprus) to highlight the extent to which the nature of Christianization was fluid in accordance with the period and location it was underway. \nThe research will primarily be undertaken in Athens to access Greek periodicals, archives and excavation reports and in the Peloponnese to undertake the fieldwork necessary to study the monuments. \nA table of the sites and the searchable image collection, will allow a thorough analysis of the chronology, architecture and topographic relationship, while an interactive map will help to situate and contextualize the data so that the wider public may have access to this otherwise poorly explored period.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A range of different groups within Greece, the UK and Europe may benefit from this work.\n \nSchool Children\nThe project website will be a public on-line resource linked through the School of Classics Website (www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics) and will contain the clickable magic map which will allow school children to be able to access contextualized images of a range of different archaeological sites in Greece (not limited to the Late Antique ones). The map of Greece will contain a number of hot spots marking sites and a hot spot is pressed, this will bring up a plan of the site which will contain further hot spots revealing photos of the architecture and associated artefacts where relevant. As an education resource, users will get an opportunity to learn about the nature of the topographic location of sites through this series of connected images.\nTraditionally religious architecture is viewed in discrete periods eg Classical Temples or Christian Basilicas but the presentation of the diachronic view as an interactive map allows an understanding of long-term continuity and change (not just a snapshot). Furthermore, it enables a deeper understanding of the use and significance of a site. While such an understanding is ideally achieved on site, this is clearly only possible for a narrow range of students. The interactive map will enable students (and others) to visualize the sites and the individual buildings in context without the traditional constraints of a flat image format. \n\nTourism and Heritage management \nMuseums in Greece may also be interested in providing access to the on-line resources, both the image collection and the interactive map, which has the potential to advertise to tourists an otherwise not well known body of evidence. This may bring more visitors to areas of the Peloponnese that are not commonly seen by tourists thereby bringing good economic benefits to some relatively deprived areas. Therefore, the resource helps to inform tourists while furthering economic benefits. \n\nStudying a chronological period less well investigated in Greece has the benefit of being able to provide evidence useful for those involved in heritage management at a government level. This work may help inform decision making concerning site management and presentation in this area by helping to define chronologies and providing use and access to images.\nIn turn this may help with policy making and implementation at a European level. \n\nPublic information \nThe work of this project allows for the augmentation of the virtual reconstruction of the Acropolis Basilica, Sparta, in Second life as part of the LAVA virtual reality excavation and integrated survey project (http://lava.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/index.html) may also be rolled out. This project is a model for accessible and wide public use and already is being applied to the virtual reconstruction of the 13th century cathedral in St Andrews which on completion will be made available for public use on-line, in museums and at Historic Scotland sites for visitors to investigate and experience the nature of church architecture.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>69711</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Peloponnese churches place, memory and emergent change</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A2C2C51-6EE0-454C-B08C-1619E0BEB4CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar Paper to the Upper House Seminar Series, British School at Athens

While the precise chronologies of the churches are still significantly elusive I believe that the application of sociological processes to understand the change allows us also broadly date churches. In order to test this I have begun to examine the data for the Late Antique churches of Crete and thus far I have found some tantalizingly different results.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The searchable image database and clickable map is the immediate outcomes of the fieldwork project.
