Nonetheless, global measurements of key atmospheric species have not been made directly by previous satellite missions and these species, particularly atomic oxygen and the hydroxyl radical (OH), are targets for a low Earth orbit mission operating in the multi-terahertz (THz) spectral range (3 - 5 THz). A LOw Cost Upper-Atmosphere sounder (LOCUS) has therefore been proposed to ESA, which would be able to detect a broad range of important species (O, O3, OH, NO, CO, H2O and HO2) between altitudes of 50 and 400 km.

Heterodyne radiometry provides a spectral resolution that is well suited to characterising emission signatures originating from the MLT. The technique has been demonstrated and proven at sub-terahertz frequencies through a number of space flight missions over the past two decades. However, operation above 3 THz (supra-terahertz) has never been attempted from a space environment, and measurements of a number of important atmospheric species that have potential impact on climate change and related space weather effects have therefore not been made. Even systems operated from an airborne platform are rare and require large instruments that are completely unsuitable for space flight. There is therefore a need to develop compact, high-sensitivity, supra-terahertz heterodyne systems capable of undertaking global atmospheric measurements from space. To achieve this goal, technical development of the heterodyne mixer detector and its local oscillator (LO) is required.

The preferred heterodyne mixing device for Earth observation is the Schottky barrier diode. Although a well-known semiconductor device, it has not been demonstrated in a planar form beyond ~3 THz and challenges related to fabrication and circuit embedding need to be solved to allow this technical evolution. Additionally, the provision of LO power and its coupling to the mixer diode, whilst already presenting a technical barrier at sub-terahertz frequencies, is a particularly difficult problem to resolve in the supra-terahertz range. Fortunately, the advent of the quantum cascade laser (QCL) semiconductor device provides the prospect of a miniaturized, low power, supra-terahertz LO source with sufficient output power to 'pump' the mixer diode as a part of the frequency down-conversion process. Additionally, electromagnetic simulation software now permits the analysis and optimisation of QCL and Schottky diode devices and their respective electrical embedding circuits, with new and advanced micro-fabrication techniques allowing corresponding manufacture. However, technical development is required before a supra-terahertz MLT remote sounding instrument can be realised. For instance, QCL and Schottky device performance optimisation, physical integration into a common (waveguide) package, and frequency stabilisation are necessary.

We therefore propose a proof-of-concept development programme with an objective of demonstrating key component technologies (QCL and Schottky diode) to a minimum technical readiness level of TRL 3. Within this programme we will significantly advance core heterodyne technologies through a stepwise development approach, and with a goal of integrating and testing a QCL and Schottky diode in a common waveguide mount. Consideration will also be given to the scientific application and future technical development towards TRL 4 and beyond.

ESA has accepted the LOCUS concept as one requiring further evaluation as a prelude to a future in-orbit demonstration. Technical advancement of a terahertz frequency spectrometer through this NERC Proof of Concept Programme would provide a step-change in the progress towards this important scientific objective, as well as positioning the UK ideally for future in-orbit programmes with ESA.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proof-of-concept research addresses core technical objectives for advancing terahertz (THz) technology in support of climate change studies. This has a direct relationship to society through increased understanding of our environment and how human activity may be detrimentally affecting it. Our work will increase the technical feasibility of a new mission concept, LOCUS, and will therefore benefit research scientists undertaking atmospheric studies, in addition to technical scientists and engineers pursuing THz research. The proposed activity will be completed with a 12 month period, a timescale consistent with the LOCUS mission, and will raise the technical readiness level and substantially increase the prospect of the mission launch in demonstration form during the next 5 years. Moreover, it will provide PI and CoI leadership opportunities for UK scientists and engineers, and be of direct benefit to UK industry via, for example, satellite payload provision to ESA. Thus, the impact is not only proof of a breakthrough concept relating to THz device development, but also novel and innovative science of direct pubic and industrial benefit.

The work will be of interest to planetary scientists and astronomers. For instance, THz spectroscopy allows sounding of the key chemical species in the dense atmospheres of the Giant Planets and potentially the atmospheres of Mars and Venus. The development of a compact, low power/low mass heterodyne THz receiver would allow high-resolution in situ measurements of planetary atmospheres from orbital spacecraft. This would return important information about the complex physical and chemistry of the planets leading to a better understanding of how the solar system formed and evolved. Additionally, the next generation of far-infrared astronomical space based facilities will require very much higher spatial resolution than presently possible with single dish space telescopes. Launching large deployable apertures is one solution to this problem, but is a hugely expensive and risky operation. QCL local oscillators operating in the supra-THz range would allow the formation of an interferometric system offering high-spatial resolution.

Our development work will enhance UK strengths in THz technology and lay the foundations for a new generation supra- THz detection systems that will generate opportunities for UK industry and achieve economic gain. Previous experience has demonstrated a strong industrial interest in, and potential commercial benefit to be gained from, applying THz sensors to weather monitoring and forecasting, communications, security surveillance, biological sensing, medical and plasma diagnostics, in addition to a growing identified interest in advancing far-infrared laboratory based spectroscopy for industrial process control, materials examination, and local pollution monitoring. Each of these topics has excellent near-term growth potential and, through commercial and industrial exploitation, represents opportunities for delivering a considerable financial return to the UK and improvements to society. For instance, Leeds work on THz time-domain spectroscopy of crystalline molecules has allowed detailed experimental and modelling studies of materials of security relevance including explosives and drugs-of-abuse. This has been collaborative with UK Government security agencies including HM Government Communications Centre, the Police Scientific Development Branch, the Home Office Centre for Applied Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Defence. Also, RAL's diode development work has attracted considerable attention from industrial organisations within the UK and overseas and has led to a spinout company (Teratech Ltd). The proof-of-concept will increase national prestige in the THz field and will be exploited in a broad range of potential applications additional to Earth observation. A forum for our work is the International Space Terahertz and Technology conference.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75979</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Study of the Earth's atmosphere is essential if we are to improve further our understanding of climate change and its causal relationship to society, future generations, and the economy. Crucial in this activity is the ability of atmospheric scientists to enhance the models from which predictions of climate variation emanate. A key underpinning of model accuracy is the validation against measured data of regions of the atmosphere that are climate change indicators. One such region is the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) in which variations in thermal structure and the distributions of critical constituents not only act as indicators of anthropogenic climate variation but also mediators of those of solar origin. Currently, it is cooling at a rate one order of magnitude faster than predicted by models. The MLT comprises an important indicator of global climate change.
Advances in satellite remotesensing measurements of the constituents of the MLT have increased our knowledge of atmospheric composition over the last decade. Nonetheless, global measurements of key atmospheric species have not been made directly by previous satellite missions. This proof-of-concept programme was designed to begin to address this situation through an innovative technical advancement in remote sounding heterodyne radiometry that involved the integration of quantum cascade laser (QCL) and Schottky barrier diode technologies to form a high-resolution spectrometer front-end. This new concept is an essential step in the development of a future payload that will allow the measurement of important atmospheric species, particularly atomic oxygen and the hydroxyl radical, from a low Earth orbit mission operating in the spectral range 3 - 5 THz. The goal of this programme was to demonstrate key component technologies (such as the THz frequency QCL) in a preliminary integrated and hybrid form. 
Terahertz frequency QCLs are compact sources of coherent radiation in the 1-5 THz band, with peak output powers of up to 1 W. Numerous potential applications exist, including their use as local oscillators for satellite-borne astronomy and atmospheric science instrumentation and as radiation sources for industrial inspection, security and biomedical imaging. However, widespread commercialization of THz QCLs has not yet been realized. One significant problem is the lack of a mechanically robust and reproducible scheme for integrating THz QCLs with external waveguides and mixers. This typically leads to large and fragile arrangements of discrete optical components. QCLs in double-metal waveguides yield the best thermal performance, and are well suited to near-field radiation coupling (e.g. into external waveguides). However, their poor far-field beam quality and wide divergence lead to poor coupling into external free-space optical components. Previous beam optimization techniques have employed either device patterning approaches or assemblies of antennas or lenses. Although a far-field beam divergence of ~20? is achievable with these techniques, they are relatively complex and their reproducibility and mechanical robustness have not been demonstrated.
In this short programme, collaborative between the University of Leeds (Schools of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, and Chemistry), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space Department Millimetre Wave Technology Group, and Remote Sensing Group), and University College London, we developed a new packaging and waveguide-integration scheme, in which a 3.5 THz double-metal QCL was ribbon bonded to a direct current (dc) stripline within a copper heat-sink enclosure containing a rectangular cross-section metallic waveguide. This approach made use of highly reproducible mechanical microfabrication techniques previously developed to support the construction of waveguide-integrated THz-frequency mixers. Since the QCL cavity itself is not modified, this approach has a very low impact on the threshold current and operating temperature range of the device, while yielding a beam divergence of &amp;lt;20&amp;deg;, comparable to the previous techniques discussed above.
A channel of cross-sectional dimensions 300 ?m &amp;times;75 ?m was precision-machined directly into a copper block, which also contained a cavity for locating the QCL device. A second identical channel was machined into another copper block and the two halves co-registered to form a full-height rectangular waveguide structure of aperture 300 ?m &amp;times; 150 ?m. The QCL array was placed in the cavity in the lower block on a 20-?m-thick layer of indium foil to ensure good thermal contact. This method allowed readjustment of the QCL position. The output facet of the central QCL ridge in the array was aligned with the waveguide aperture (with the other devices being left unused), and a 125 ?m &amp;times; 12.5 ?m gold ribbon bond wire was used to provide an electrical dc or pulsed bias connection to the top contact of the QCL.
The complete assembled block was mounted onto the cold-finger of a liquid-helium cryostat, and the temperature monitored at the top of the block using a silicon diode. For pulsed characterization, the QCL was driven using a 10 kHz, 2% duty-cycle current pulse train, which was modulated using a 167 Hz square wave to match the peak responsivity of a helium-cooled bolometric detector. THz emission was observed up to a maximum operating heat-sink temperature, Tmax, of 90 K. This compared favourably with the performance of an equivalent, unmounted device. For continuous-wave (cw) operation, the QCL was driven using a dc power supply, and the beam was modulated at 185 Hz using an optical chopper. The block-integrated device was again found to have a low-temperature threshold current and maximum operating temperature that compared favourably with the unmounted device. These results imply that our mounting methodology introduces no significant thermal or electronic perturbation to the laser performance. The emission spectra of the two devices were measured using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. In each case, a similar spectral bandwidth (~120 GHz) and centre frequency (~3.38 THz) were observed, further supporting our conclusion that the mounting scheme does not introduce any significant perturbation to the internal properties of the laser.
The peak THz power emitted from the device was estimated to be ~20% of the value measured for the equivalent unmounted device. We attribute this to a mismatch between the transverse mode profile of the laser cavity and that of the relatively wide rectangular waveguide, and between the waveguide aperture and free space. However, this is not a fundamental issue and it is important to note that as a first exploratory development step, the waveguide cross-sectional dimensions were selected on the basis of easing mechanical construction and simplifying the QCL-waveguide interface. Furthermore, the absolute THz power emission is already sufficient for the development of applications.
The far-field beam profile of the block-integrated QCL was measured using a Golay detector with an entrance aperture of 1 mm diameter, positioned at a longitudinal distance of 32.4 mm from the laser facet. An approximately Gaussian single-lobed profile could be fitted to the far-field pattern in both directions, and that the 'ringing' that is commonly associated with the beam profiles of unmounted double-metal QCLs was removed entirely. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) in the growth and in-plane directions was 20&amp;deg; and 17&amp;deg;, respectively, comparable to the divergence obtained previously by patterning the QCL or through the use of device-integrated antenna structures or lenses.
In conclusion, through this programme, we demonstrated a new waveguide-integration scheme for THz QCLs, which is based on a highly reproducible precision-micromachining technique. This approach yields a beam divergence of &amp;lt;20&amp;deg; and eliminates the spatial 'ringing' commonly seen in double-metal QCL beam profiles, without the need for any complex device-specific semiconductor processing techniques. The block integration has been shown not to introduce any significant degradation in the threshold current or operating temperature range. Future development activity will pursue the integration of a Schottky diode within the waveguide structure to form a complete THz heterodyne mixer.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This programme has already contributed to follow-on programmes with the CEOI-ST (Centre for Earth Observation Instrumentation, EO 8th Call), and ESTEC (European Space Research and Technology Centre; GSTP).
