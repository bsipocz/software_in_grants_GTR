Caroline Hunter spoke about the research at Homeless Link's Research Forum on March 12. 2013. Following that her slides for the talk and the research summary were posted on their website and sent out to the Forum mailing list.
Caroline Hunter was an invited speaker at a Lemos &amp;amp; Crane training event for homelessness practitioners entitled Homelessness Prevention and Support on June 6, 2013. Her presentation included a discussion of the outcomes of the research, and their implications for homelessness organisations. 
The findings have also been disseminated with recommendations for best practice through practitioner publications.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B167484D-51C3-49B6-95C8-E37E21FA015C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545249ed9dd452.60133994</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Under the Housing Act 1996 where a person applies to the local authority as homeless, the authority must investigate the application. The full duty to house an applicant only arises if the applicant falls within one of the priority need categories. For applicants without children the authority must be satisfied that he or she is 'vulnerable'. This often turns on the physical or mental ill-health of the applicant. 

This study examined how three varied local authorities make decisions on vulnerability where medical evidence is involved. This was explored through interviews and focus groups of staff. A further detailed analysis of 41 cases from across the authorities was undertaken.

The project found that early impressions formed by homelessness officers of applicants were important as they fed into the professional intuition of the officer as to the legitimacy of the application. That said, levels of legal consciousness and conscientious were high: officers were very aware of relevant legal cases and the risk of decision being overturned on review or appeal. The aim of getting decisions 'right first time' was thus given primacy. 

A variety of sources of information was used by officers in decision-making. These included evidence from an applicant's own doctors (particularly GPs), in house and external advice, information from the internet and information relating to benefits. There was not, as expected, a perceived hierarchy of expertise, but rather a search for an objective view of the evidence which was most readily perceived to come from those who were trusted as objective sources. Internal advisors were seen as providing the most reliable information.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Local authorities might use it as a basis for developing their policies and for training homelessness staff.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>93868984-BE68-483C-B576-F9CB391CDCC3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545248539dee29.72890135</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.york.ac.uk/law/research/projects/#tab-1</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A5F5C631-8663-4A5E-8D51-2CC5F7702CF8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Legal Compliance in Street-Level Bureaucracy: A Study of UK Housing Officers</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Law &amp; Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/144414971ab1933dcfdae8f750f0b95d"><gtr:id>144414971ab1933dcfdae8f750f0b95d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hunter C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b8b7bbb39927.03088916</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C208642B-C9F6-4214-8FB8-A2A32E59719C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Medical evidence in homelessness cases</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Legal Action</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/144414971ab1933dcfdae8f750f0b95d"><gtr:id>144414971ab1933dcfdae8f750f0b95d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hunter C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54524dd856b288.10944983</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A039042C-F542-4D86-8B74-766C1ACF6D86</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;You can judge them on how they look...&amp;quot; : homelessness officers, medical evidence and decision-making in England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Homelessness</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4dbb19019338738dff93cb412e7d3b65"><gtr:id>4dbb19019338738dff93cb412e7d3b65</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Caroline Margaret Hunter (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_5152725664cb2a1832</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I032355/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-4461</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
