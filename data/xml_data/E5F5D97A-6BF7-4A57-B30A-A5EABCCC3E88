Pathways and outcomes for maltreated children in a multi-ethnic cohort</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L002566/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>It is widely considered that outcomes for 'looked after' children (children in care) are generally poor. Research has pointed to poor education outcomes, high rates of mental health problems, disproportionate involvement in substance abuse and crime and the over-representation of care leavers among the unemployed, homeless and prison populations. However, most studies to date have found it hard to disentangle the effects of being in care from the impact of the difficult experiences (in most cases, abuse or neglect) that led to their admission. One of the reasons for this has been the difficulty of collecting data on children and their family backgrounds before they are taken into care. As a result, key questions remain unanswered. Does being in care compensate children for previous disadvantage and improve their wellbeing, from a frequently low starting point? Or does it instead compound the disadvantages they bring with them into care? In other words, do children who enter care do better or worse than children with similar backgrounds and histories who remain at home? 

The aim of this study is to investigate whether outcomes for abused or neglected children who are admitted to care are better or worse than those for similar children who remain at home, supervised by social workers on a Child Protection Plan.It will be conducted in Bradford and will draw on data from two types of pre-existing dataset: (a) the Born in Bradford (BiB) Cohort Study and (b) Bradford Council's administrative databases on children known to have experienced abuse or neglect and children who are admitted to care. The BiB cohort study provides a fantastic opportunity to investigate the effects of being in care in relation to the effects of abuse, neglect and family difficulties, because it provides information on children's family circumstances before they entered care. During ante-natal appointments, it gathered information from the mothers of approximately 14,000 children born in Bradford April 2007-June 2011, at which time they gave written consent to the future linkage of this data with other data. 

By linking anonymised data from these three existing datasets, the study will be able to identify all children in the BiB cohort deemed to have experienced abuse or neglect since April 2007 and, within this group (likely to be around 540 in number), to identify which of them have been taken into care. We will then follow up all abused and neglected children, who will be 2-6 years old at the time of the study, to compare the development and well-being of those placed in foster care to the progress of those who remain at home, by three means:
(a) a survey of social workers 
(b) Interviews with the foster carers of the children in care and the parents of children living at home, 
(c) Assessment of children's language development and early reading ability. 
In these ways the study will gather information on children's general health and development, emotional, behavioural or attachment difficulties (if any), language development and early reading skills, their overall well-being and whether they have been re-abused. This will allow us to analyse the relative effects on their development and well-being of their family backgrounds, their experience of abuse and neglect and of being in care.

One of the toughest decisions that Children's Services have to make is whether to support abused and neglected children at home or take them into care. This multi-disciplinary study will be useful to policy-makers and practitioners as it will provide important new information on the circumstances in which support at home, or alternatively entry to care, can best promote the safety and development of children who have experienced abuse or neglect. It will also help to advance scientific understanding of the impact of placement in care on abused children.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study will benefit a range of managers and professionals in the field of child protection and services for looked after children, including those working in social work services (social workers, children's guardians, independent reviewing officers and voluntary sector agencies providing services to abused and/or looked after children) as well as health, education and family justice professionals. It will also benefit national and local policy-makers responsible for child protection services and for planning for looked after children. Ultimately, and most importantly, it will benefit abused and neglected children, including those who become looked after. 

Its benefits will be realised through the impact it has on local and national policy and on professional decision-making. Decisions about when it is best to support maltreated children at home and when it is better to admit them to care or accommodation are notoriously difficult to make, due to their inherent complexity and the uncertainty that inevitably characterizes them. Although such decisions will always remain a matter of professional judgment, this study will provide important new evidence to inform both national and local policy and professional judgement in individual cases. No prospective study of the kind proposed has previously been undertaken in the UK. By advancing scientific understanding of how, why and in what circumstances outcomes for maltreated children are more likely to be positive if they become looked after (or alternatively, if they remain at home), this study will help to develop the knowledge base that can be drawn on by , magistrates, managers and professionals involved in decision-making in child protection. 

This knowledge will also contribute to the development of public policy on child protection, particularly in the fields of social work and health (including public health, community paediatrics and mental health).Even more importantly, the study has the potential to benefit vulnerable children, if better-informed decisions are made as a result of it. In the longer term, its findings may help to inform social work education (including continuing professional education) and help to ensure that both decision-making and support for maltreated children are more likely to enhance their well-being. 

In these ways, the study will make an important contribution to increasing the effectiveness of public policy and services, particularly in the field of children's social care. It also has the potential to enhance the health, wellbeing and quality of life of maltreated children by improving the quality of professional decision-making and support.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>446873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Briefing sent to participating local authority.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3247677-BA90-4A7E-8869-5A4DCE9F3879</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sent briefing to senior staff at local authority where study took place to update them on dissemination plans.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5851935d3c3461.59714637</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>European conference, on Social Work Research, Lisbon, Portugal</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3B8022E7-3B75-4742-8E75-0853F019F785</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented paper on initial study findings to Euorpean Conference on Social Work Research (ECSWR),Catholic University of Lisbon, Lisbon.

This has led to criticism that the care system is failing children. However, the majority of these children enter care due to abuse and/or neglect and there is strong evidence that these often have a negative impact on child health and development. 

Unlike most previous studies, this study compared children who became looked after due to maltreatment to other maltreated children who were supported at home on a Child Protection Plan for a while and never entered care. The 390 children were referred by the age of seven and followed up an average of five years later. 

The study provides important new evidence on outcomes for looked after children. These children were more likely to have mental health difficulties than maltreated children who had never been looked after, but the difference between the groups was very small. Other factors also played a part. The likelihood of mental health difficulties was greater where parents had a greater number of problems (such as substance misuse or mental health problems) or the child had a disability, and was lower for children whose current caregivers (parents, relatives or foster carers) showed greater warmth. 

On average, the children performed less well on tests of receptive vocabulary, phonics and early educational performance (Early Years Foundation and Key Stage 1 tests) than children in the wider population. However, when we compared looked after children to those who had never been looked after we found no significant differences in these respects. This suggests that their poorer speech, language development and educational performance were at least partially due to the histories of maltreatment and family difficulty they shared with maltreated children who remained at home and, as with mental health difficulties, these were unlikely to result from their placement in care.

The study also makes an important contribution to recent debates about the high number of children referred to Children's Services and the rising number entering care. We found no evidence that children were placed on Child Protection Plans or taken into care unnecessarily. Nearly three-quarters had experienced multiple types of maltreatment and for over 80% this was extremely severe (as rated on a standardised measure of maltreatment severity) and often persistent. Children who became looked after were more likely to have experienced high severity abuse and/or neglect than those who remained in their families. In particular, they were more likely to experience physical abuse or severe neglect and were younger, on average, than those who never entered care. 

There was also little evidence of the peremptory removal of children, although this did occur in some cases where the risk of immediate harm was high. Parental difficulties contributed to decisions to take children into care, including persistent drug and alcohol misuse and mental health problems. These decisions were also influenced by parents' willingness to accept the concerns about their child and to engage in work to reduce the risk of harm.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our impact strategy will ensure that the study contributes to the development of national and local child protection policy and practice.

A. KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE WITH THE PARTICIPATING LOCAL AUTHORITY
? We have arranged seminars with managers and staff and their partners in the other agencies to discuss study findings and explore their views on the implications for practice.
? We are preparing briefings on key findings which will be posted on the local authority's intranet. 

B. INFORMING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL POLICY AND PRACTICE.
1. We will send briefings to:
? Policy leads on child protection and foster care at the Department for Education and Scottish Government
? Policy officers at relevant national charities e.g. NSPCC (which has offered to share our findings on their website)
? The Association of Directors of Children's Services 
? Our contacts in local authority Children's Services departments

2. Tweets will include links to these briefings.

3. We will propose the publication of articles on study findings to the relevant weekly (online) journals for social work managers and practitioners e.g.Community Care magazine.

C. ACADEMIC IMPACT
We are currently preparing five articles for publication in high impact academic journals and plan to disseminate our findings at three international conferences during 2017.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0016D036-CDF2-45DC-A16B-8E4D739F16BE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c434a71ad3f5.14258778</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E3AE3C3A-F1C8-4A27-9C36-FE3194AEF06F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mind-mindedness in parents of looked-after children.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Developmental psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/36d56beb31d8c8d1cba89d8f6149ede3"><gtr:id>36d56beb31d8c8d1cba89d8f6149ede3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fishburn S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0012-1649</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a350d67616aa1.54480664</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002566/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D8C04024-FB47-49BA-9905-98DD5083D92E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Children and Families</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
