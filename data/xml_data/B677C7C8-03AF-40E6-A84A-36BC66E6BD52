CROHM RT will be able to combine conventional energy survey data with high frequency energy monitoring data and detailed tenant energy usage and appliance data. This will enable significantly more powerful automated analysis and scenario modelling than is currently possible. 

At present CROHM provides strategic energy installation guidance based on modelling of energy data across a portfolio; EnergyDeck collates and presents real time monitoring data. CROHM RT will enable a significant enhancement by enabling the combination of these existing services in creative ways, for example: quantification of comfort factors based on monitored data; incorporation of meter readings and tenant appliance and behaviour profiles to identify and support opportunities for behaviour change, predicting the actual effect of energy efficiency measures in actual situations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Innovation: This project will develop a uniquely integrated, scalable responsive energy management model that enables landlords to assess, monitor and appropriately respond to variations in energy usage across large stock portfolios. The validated housing energy model will integrate for the first time actual hourly energy usage and weather data with detailed analysis of appliance specific asset data to identify causes of high or low energy use. This unprecendented integration will power a new generation of responsive energy management across thousands of homes. By pinpointing effective interventions, responses can be appropriately directed and monitored, whether this means replacement or servicing of appliances, checking quality of installation or through behavioural or financial advice and support for tenants.

Commercial viability: The primary medium term focus of CROHM RT will be asset managers within affordable housing, managing large residential portfolios. This provides an immediate market opportunity. In the UK there is a market of 600 organisations managing 5 million affordable homes. The potential market in Europe is extensive, with over nine million affordable homes in France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands alone.

In the longer term, the roll out of smart metering to all homes across Europe and increasingly low cost home energy monitoring will open an even wider market while rising energy bills and tightening legislation drive increasing demand for energy saving through improved energy management.

Collaboration: The consortium is a carefully selected team that includes core software development partners, an academic energy modelling expert, partners with expertise in tenant engagement and installation of monitoring hardware and two future customers. The product will further inform and facilitate collaborative energy management between landlords, tenants, installers and manufacturers throughout the supply chain.

Real-time energy management and verification at, and beyond the whole building scale: Carbon Reduction Options for Housing Managers Real Time (CROHM RT) will provide hourly energy management information to individual homes or across a complete housing portfolio, enabling proactive, real time responses to inform investment decisions, identify and improve actual technical issues, and support behaviour change.

Valued by customers: The consortium has developed this concept in partnership with existing clients and potential customers. Two future customers (Amicus Horizon and Northwards Housing Association) will be working closely on detailed development as part of the consortium. For clients CROHM RT will pay for itself through improved investment decisions, improved performance of installations and reduced energy bills.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48318</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M506746/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
